"What a great bag!  The first thing that caught my eye was the beautiful colors!  It does not disappoint!  This bag is the perfect size for many occasions.  For me-my need is for a travel bag.  Something I can throw a book and my basic needs into.  It zips shut which is a real plus!  It has inner pockets so that you don't lose your smaller items (chapstick, loose change, lotion).  Surprisingly, it even has a small clutch purse on the inside that you can easily access.  Is there something you need to get to quick?  Look at the zippered pocket on the outside.  Just what you need when you are in a hurry-put that important item there so you don't have to dig!  Honestly, the bag just looks classy and feels luxurious!  You have got to see it to understand!  I would purchase this bag again and I recommend it highly.  You should know that I received this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest and impartial review.",1
"I religously use an OtterBox for my phone's but wanted to try something different that would hold my cards and was a little bit slimmer so I went with the Buddibox.

The design of the case good quality and it covers the phone completely. The phone slips in easily and still gives you access to all of the buttons and doesn't interfere with the camera at all. When the case itself is closed, even with cards in all of the slots and a little cash in the back pouch, it lays flat without any bulge.  It doesn't have any extra frills which makes it unisex and a man could just as easily use it. It slips into my bag without taking up as much room as an Otterbox but since it has card slots built in you don't even need to carry a bag.

PRO'S
* It's small
* I can still take pictures
* It lays flat
* Gives the camera some padding so it doesn't get scratched
* It offers some privacy from wandering eyes
* It will hold cards and cash so you don't have to take a purse as well
* It's unisex design
* Holds cards securely
* It doesn't vibrate as loudly
* Isn't a wristlet
* It comes with a screen cover

CONS
* I wish the corners had a little more cushion to protect when its dropped
* It closes with a magnetic flap but the magnet isn't very strong and can easily open when dropped
* The kickstand takes a little time to break in
* I can't see the notification indicator
* Isn't a wristlet
* It doesn't vibrate as loudly

It's a good alternative if you need a case but don't want something as large and bulky as an Otterbox (or something like an otterbox). It's great for being able to leave your purse behind and gives you easy access to your cards when you need them instead of having to dig for them when you're in a rush.

Overall its a nice, no frills case.

Comfortable but challenging to keep at desired inflation.,0
These are great swim shorts.  Very bibrant! Looks well put together.  My one complaint is that they are very small.  I ordered a extra large and they might be the same size as a medium.  I received this product at a discount or for free for my honest opinion.,1
"I bought this product hoping to make some nice bracelets. I ended up buying the 2mm black onyx and got an 8mm black onyx instead!! These stones are beautiful, but I am very disappointed with the SIX mm difference. Also I did not receive a free gift. One plus was that it came a few days early, but I do not think these beads are worth (with standard shipping) 16 dollars.",1
"Great quality shoes for the price!!!  My son loves shoes he can wear without socks, get wet, but are also easy for him to out on and take off.  I was iffy about purchasing shoes from Amazon without being able to feel the quality, but these are very nice!  They fit as expected, the colors are bright, and the material is just soft enough to be comfy but hard enough to stand up to the punishment of my 5 year old.  I will comment again in the future if he is able to destroy them :)

"These horns last forever! I've had two of these floating around my house for a month now and my dogs absolutely love working on them. Both of my dogs are in the 40-50 pound range and these horns have lasted longer with their chewing than most bone-like treats have. So far I've seen no splinters, no breaking. They don't smell, unlike other treats we've given our dogs. I highly recommend these if you're looking for a healthy treat that will keep your dog's teeth and gums in good shape.

I was sent this item, either for free or at a discount, for testing and review purposes.",1

  I wanted this bra for the gym and around the house where I hate to wear a tight, conforming bra. Many bras are uncomfortable and the first thing that a woman thinks about when getting home is whipping that bra off, now. When the opportunity came up to try this brand at a reduced cost for an honest review I jumped at it. I am completely happy with this product and how it makes me feel and how it feels while wearing it. It is comfortable but at the same time provides adequate support. Would I buy this product again? yes I would. Would I recommend this product to other people? Yes I would including friends and family..I absolutely think this is great product.

Roswear Women's Padded Color Block Push Up bra bathing suit in black and white arrived this weekend! it fits great! I love it! I am so excited to wear this to Punta Cana for my honeymoon! it fits great and I am so excited that the straps are adjustable! it is made well and the material and adjustments are great!,0
"Well it's very nice first off. I've ordered from them before and like their merchandise. Seems like they skip the fancy packageing and send to you in your area regular envelop. Never had a problem with my order/ or not fitting, being late etc. So I will order from them again. I like the quality... Design.... Enough said.",0
"Actually, I LOVED my little Weber Q1400 electric grill but after 3 years, it just died. Why would I dislike the Q 2400? Actually, its the larger grill surface. By spreading out the elements over a larger surface, the grill doesn't nearly get as hot using the same 110V circuit in my townhome. In fact, I have never seen the grill get to a temperature that the heat levels out - power always stays on. For a smaller group of 1-2, the bigger Weber is a waste - it just doesn't get as hot. Wish I had bought the smaller Q1400.",0
"Great fit, great price, fast delivery.",0
Nice case. Slim profile isn't bulky.,0
A simple tool that does a great job.,0
"Awful! Read the other reviews and you'll see why. I have the same complaint.
Would never purchase again.",0
"Life with cats is definitely easier when you have all of the right equipment and that includes kitty liter mats! The Pet Pagoda mat is a great size that allows a lot of the litter that gets stuck to my cats feet to be caught in the fibers. This prevents bits of cat liter from being tracked beyond that area.
love the pattern and texture of the mat. I received the gray mat. The unique design makes it look more like a rug than a cat liter mat, which I really like. We generally take the mat outside to shake and then brush off. This is very easy to clean. Although I have not had to use the hose to wash our mat yet, I can see why it would be easy to do. I'm lucky that my cat doesn't 'mess' anywhere he's not supposed to! After a while any surface can start smelling of kitty liter so I will be scrubbing this from time to time just for that reason.

I took a close up of the mat to show how the litter easily gets trapped. Because of the type of material used, this will be much easier than having to deal with the old rug we used to deal with. I received this at a discount for my evaluation and honest review.",1
"This was Bought for me as a gift and I must say I love it! the durability is great.
The ball head works wonderfully and the pricing for the limited edition one is perfect if your on a budget.
Would definitely recommend this to a friend.",0
We use these for our kids swing and they work great. Have held up well through the weather and handling the friction well from the wood they are wrapped around.,0
Works fine.,0
it works great .i received it a few days early,0
Was comfortable after i added on the extender that came with it,0
"I really like this clock. It allows me to press the top and see the time on the ceiling or wall without raising up to look at my main clock in the bedroom, which is sometimes very hard to do  If you have back problems, or have just had surgery. It is a little difficult to get all the settings just right but after that is done it is a real help at night to see what time it is. It is nice to either run on usb power or AAA batteries. I've been looking for a clock like this for a long time, but they were very expensive. This alarm clock won't break the bank, and is a real big help. This product was provided for free, or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1
Too flimsy. Not of any use.,0
"The fur was coming off when i open the package, handcuffs broke during ""play time"".

Great little kitchen tool; its eggcellent,0
"Nice and clean looking electronic salt OR pepper grinder.
This unit puts out a nice fine grain with no effort on your part and has a nifty light as well. My biggest complaint would be how small the salt OR pepper chamber is. The product is plenty tall and would seem to hold a lot more, but its all battery compartment. I thinking that's why I like how powerful it is (all the batteries), but am not looking forward to filling it all the time. I will probably only use this at the table opposed to a cooking tool so I don't have to keep refilling as much.
I also must have read the description wrong, or misunderstood as I thought I was receiving a salt AND pepper grinder. When I first opened it up and saw only one unit  I was thinking maybe it was even cooler than I thought, that maybe it had salt on one end and pepper on the other. However, that was not the case. You need to buy two units in order to have one for salt and one for pepper.

"This economical cooler is both aesthetically and practically essential for keeping wine nicely chilled.  Unlike ice-buckets, there's no problem with dripping water, and the wine won't become overly chilled.",0
"These are actually a really nice pair of shoes for the price, BUT TAKE GOOD NOTE OF THE SIZING! It does indeed run a little small. I have a pair of 8.5 M size Sperrys and with those, I have a good centimeter or two from the tip of my toe to the edge of the shoes. With these shoes, however, I ordered 8.5 M size and you can see my big toe wanting to stick out of the shoe (it makes a sizeable lump). Thankfully, the shoes are mesh and are comfortable in general so its not a huge issue. This is the only reason I took off a star.

Other notes:
What I like
- Cheap-feeling, but nice and comfortablecolor is nice too!
- SUPER light. Feels like it shouldas if Im just wearing cloth over my feet with a nice thick sole.

What I don't like
- See my note above about sizing

Over all, worth getting!

According to reviews I expected more than I should. It's just a cheap China made product. It zooms enough just to see a bird on a tree that is right in front of you.,0
"I have had this floor cleaner for just over a year.  We use it to clean our tile floors which comes in handy as we have several dogs.  This machine has been average in comparison to the Hoover Floormate Hard Floor Cleaner (FH40010B) that we had previously.  The Hoover Floormate Deluxe does not have anywhere near the suction or scrubbing power in comparison.  Nor does it seem to last anywhere near as long as the FH40010B that we had for several years before the wheel assembly broker.  My most definitive reason for not recommending this product is the fact that in just over a year (May 2016 was one year of ownership), the hose that connects the body of the cleaner to the head has come almost completely apart rendering the machine pretty much useless as it cannot suck up liquids of any kind.  I am a huge fan of many Hoover products and it is the only vacuum and carpet cleaner I will buy.  That being said this specific product needs some design corrections to make it what its predecessors were in quality and durability.",0
"Very nice product! I didn't think it was cheap or flimsy material like a few others have said...it's holding up with my 5 year old and her kitten attacking it so that's saying something! (We haven't hung it up yet) Love the way they have it set up in rows and columns, it really helps kids to see the numbers lined up like this....it just seems to make more sense to them this way. My 5 year old likes it & uses it for counting so you can't go wrong with that! I would definitely recommend this chart to anyone.",0
"I got this for my wife.  She is a size 6, and the ring size was perfect.  It is also small and compact.  The picture shown in the product makes it appear larger (possibly because they are showing men's version).  This one is perfect for a woman's hand.  It looks great and we love the infinity (eternity) logo as well because of what it symbolizes.  The material is soft silicone, and feels very comfortable on the finger.  This ring is made of food grade silicone so it is safe to wear.  We are really happy with this ring and it now serves its purpose of being used when we are doing work with our hands and don't want to damage our gold or diamonds rings.  It allows us to still show our commitment to each other with a silicone ring during those times.  She is really happy with the ring and I highly recommend the product to others.

"I ordered the Men's Plaid Knit Lounge Shorts in an @XL for my husband.  These shorts are very well made and comfortable.  The fabric is thin and light weight which is perfect for my hot natured husband.  The length of the shorts are great.  They hit right at his knee.  I washed the shorts and they held their shape and still fit the same.  I will be ordering some more of these shorts soon.

I received this product free for my unbiased review and testing.",1
"Overall the product looked decent when arriving small package which included; one large box, with grill, cook surface, fondue pot, forks ,and trays

Overall for the price for this item is great. I love the option to fondue and cook all in one. We used this two nights in a row we just could not get enough. The unit puts out a fair amount of heat so be careful of the table surroundings. We will be using this at least a few times a month for family meals around the table.

"I bought this for my mom for a Mother's Day Present. It's well made and the inside is just as adorable as the outside. She told me she has gotten so many compliments. Great purchase!

I will have to edit my review. After a few months of using this purse, it is already falling apart. The bow has come off and the handles are ripping. So disappointing!",0
"I received this package very quickly.  All of the items were packaged up nicely and everything seems to be in perfect condition.  I have an android phone and have no access to an Iphone, but the android cable works perfectly.  I also tested both ports on the receptacle, and both functioned flawlessly. The port with 2.1A charges my phone alot faster than the other, but some phone need the lower amperage.  This charger has a nice textured anti-slip grip that provides easy handling while placing it in the charging port or removing.

Overall, this is a solid charger and it would be a great item for anyone to use for charging up all of your electronics.

"If the price is too good to be true, it probably is.  This bag appears to be marked down 50%, but I would price it at the $40-50 as a realistic reflection of its quality.

PROS:  Lots of space, very compartmentalized to store lots of stuff.
CONS: Poor quality of materials. multiple zippers broke quickly, bottom wears easily, and bag not wide enough to carry easily.  Bat compartment separator broke quickly as well, making it very hard to get 34"" bats to fit all the way in.

Used for 2-3 months, went back to my old Demarini bag that has lasted 3 years, will probably take the wheels off this bag to use on it, so not a total waste, and I provided my wife some vindication as well since she bought me the old bag, so an added bonus.  :)",0

"I bought this armband to stow my Samsung Galaxy S7 in while I am running.  I like the material because it does not irritate my skin and stays in place while I am running as well as working out.  This is worth the money.

This key holder fits my Dodge Ram key perfectly! I've been looking everywhere for one but with no luck until now. I am able to fit this huge 4 button remote key and my house key into this holder. I have had no problem keeping it where I hid it on my thruck. the magnet is strong enough to keep it in place.

"I found the bore sighted to be easy to use, but you'll need the instructions inside to put it together. The battery compartment and on/off switch could be better protected. The laser could be more refined too. It is ok at short distances but when you get it out further the small dot doubles and triples in size. It is a good product for those who are trying to sight quickly, but for those who need long distance sighting, it may not be for you.

"We love our new OXO coffee maker! Favorite features:
-The easy to set timer that lets you wake up to the sound and smell of coffee brewing
-The internal mixer somehow really does prevent the coffee from separating. Every sip down to the last is the same.
-The carafe keeps the coffee warm
-The design is gorgeous and sleek

"Once I ordered this bra it got here extremely quick.  I was excited that is fit as expected.  One thing I did do was look at the sizing chart before I ordered and I choose one size bigger than what I normally wear and I am so glad I did or it would have been to small.  So I wore this bra for a whole day and it quickly became one of my favorites.  It's not to tight or too loose.  This sports bra is easily the best sports bra I have ever bought.  The fabric is so so soft.  I decided to work out in this bra as well and was surprised to find that it stayed put did not ride up or down.  The support it offered was very good as well with also maintaining the comfort which for me is really hard to find in a sports bra.  Most of the sports bras I own are either to tight to to uncomfortable after a short while of wearing them.  Not this one is just like it glides right over top of your own shape and holds it there.  I would recommend this sports bra to anyone who like me has trouble finding a sports bra that is comfortable and supportive.  In all honesty at the end of the day I really did not want to take it off.

"This watch looks so much more expensive than what it is. It comes in a beautiful black gift box that doesn't even have to be wrapped because it's so pretty. The brown leather band is stylish and bends easily. The face of the watch is large and has so far shown itself to be quite the conversation starter. I didn't realize so many people collected watches. People are surprised when my wife tells them we got it on Amazon. It says it's waterproof but I haven't tested that out yet.

These sunglasses are such a great buy I love them! They are a little stiff when you get them but once you adjust them to your liking they are super comfortable. They look super dark since they are polarized but not too dark that you can't see while in the sun. I have purchased other inexpensive sunglasses from other places and was disappointed because I couldn't see at all due to the darkness. With these there is no issue. They have a nice mirror effect which is what everyone has right now when it comes to sunglasses. I had my doubts if they were going to have the mirror effect due to the pic in the description but I am so glad I was wrong and got them anyway. They are good size for a medium sized face frame and are not too big or too small. They are just the right size. As soon as I received them I took them out and wore them out and got a compliment within a couple of hours. Recommended them to look for Joopin on Amazon and take advantage of this great deal. These are stylish enough to wear everyday and inexpensive that you don't feel guilty in case they break. Can't wait to get another pair in a different shade. They come with an awesome bulky case for good protection or a simple cloth bag as well as a small cleaning cloth. It is a great deal for the price.

"Nice and comphy, I always buy Gildan if possible!",0
"I was really anxious to receive this ""dress"" but as soon as I opened the package I realized it would be better suited as a t shirt with some type of pants, leggings or tights underneath. The shirt is very comfortable and cute, just not long enough to wear as a dress. It is also very thin. In the picture the color seems to fade at the bottom but I was a little disappointed to find out that was only the lighting. It's still a very pretty color though. I would recommend this product for petite women to wear as a dress, but taller, curvy women would only find this suitable as a t shirt. Either way, I like it.

"These are perfect for helping keep birds off my roof.

They are nice and neat and discreet when fitted and really flexible.  If you need them to go round cures then these will.  They are really easy to fit and the supplied silicone is just enough to fit the pack.  If you do need them to curve you will need alternative fittings.

So far they have worked and I will be getting more in the future to protect other parts of my house.

"Powerlead sent me a sample of this product at reduced or no cost - they were promised my honest opinion in return, and here it is. After using this camera side-by-side with an SJCam SJ4000, a GoPro Hero+ and another off-brand SJ4000 clone, I've come to the conclusion that the PowerLead PC6 has the worst quality of the lot. Now I will grant you that the GoPro is more expensive, and predictably it does have the best quality. That said, the SJ4000 and its clone were less than $100, and the clone was only $6 more expensive than the PC6.

Re-reading the reviews on this page leaves me wondering whether I got a dud or not, because some people seem to be quite pleased with it. I, however, simply cannot get past the poor quality. I don't care so much about the lack of controls, archaic settings control and the fact that this ""waterproof"" sports camera is one small rubber sealing ring away from being a strangely-shaped paper weight...but the quality, that's a completely different story.

I will post a video early next week with sample footage so you can see for yourself, but overall I'm not impressed with this camera. It has very few things going for it (the price, its small footprint) and a lot that I take issue with. As of right now, I can't really recommend it at all. Besides, all of the one-hit wonder reviewers on the front page are doing enough recommending already...",1
"I wear mostly wear these types of pants when I am at home or exercising. And like most people, I can always use more! The delivery was very quick and the packaging was perfect. The material is very high quality..great stretch and soft on the skin. No the weird soft that seems to get snagged on everything. I love the length, especially since warmer weather is finally here. I normally like to wear my pants below my naval and from what I could see on the picture on Amazon, I figured I was safe with these. However, these sit VERY low. There is no room to ""hike"" them up to compensate either. I ordered the correct size, just the style is different than I am use too. I decided to keep them and I am happy I did. When I wear them to exercise in, I just make sure my shirt is plenty long enough to cover everything and I am good to go. There is zero chaffing with these...and the mesh insert really does help with the heat and moisture. I would certainly recommend the seller and the pants. I did receive this item at a discount in return for my honest review. I was not guided on what to write in this review nor was I compenstaed in any form. 100% HONEST.",1

"This case has some pros and some cons. What I don't like about the case is the stand is removable and does not snap tight to the ipad. It is very lose and falls off easily. It also has little rubber feet on it that will not stay on for anything. This is especially annoying when my kids put the ipad on the table and move it. The feet without the rubber on them make a horrible noise. It does not affect the actual usage though. I also do not like that the screen cover is not the greatest. When you look at it, you can see scratches all over it and those scratches came on it, it's nothing my kids put there. I noticed them when I removed the protective cover before placing it on the ipad. My kids will put their own scratches in it so it is not a huge deal to me. You also have to move a piece of case, rubber, that is snapped into place to use the camera. It is difficult for my young kids to do that however I can use it just fine.

What I do love about this case is that the ipad is very secure in it. It snaps on easily and stays on. My 1 1/2 year old has gotten her hands on my ipad and thrown it and it does absolutely no harm to the ipad, which is what is most important to me in a case. It does make the ipad a little on the heavy side but that is not a problem for me. My kids can all still use it just fine so I don't think that is an issue.

"I freaking love these headphones!!! I use them mostly when I'm relaxing or when I go to bed. I used to have the ones with the Big b price tag and these ones for way less perform better and I can even use them to take or make phone calls, fast forward and go to last track. I have both; Android and Apple phones and both connected fast with the bluetooth but one feature stands out for you guys with Android phones you can connect them with NFC!!! Also included are the AUX cable so if you want to connect them to a non bluetooth device. The headphones rotate so you can hear it while wearing them around the neck. They look well constructed and really nice looking. I already used them for a couple of days (about 36hrs) and so far still working on the first charge!!! Phone calls are clear and people I talk to says the same. I received this product for free or at a discount. I was in no way obligated to give this a favorable review. My reviews are my honest and unbiased opinion after use of the products good or bad. If you found my review helpful please click yes below and thanks in advance!

**UPDATE**
IF you're spending money on other headphones because of the brand then you're fooling yourself and trowing money away just because!!! These headphones should be marketed more, from personal experience with them I highly recommend them! Try them out and if they're not what I'm telling you return them, you can't loose so why not try them out????",1
"This is seriously the best Pet nail grooming kit I have ever seen! I have 4 cats so having to take all of them to get their nails trimmed can be such a hassle, plus expensive! Just one cat to get their nails trimmed is 15 dollars! I love how there are so many options in this pet nail grooming kit to cut your pet's nails! You have the pet grinder to grind away some of those sharp claws that get you on accident when you are sleeping and you move your feet in the middle of the night! Plus it comes with a nail clipper and a file if you need to file down the nails by hand! I love that the nail grinder and clipper have ports and sizes where you can change the amount you want to cut and you will never cut your pet's nails too short! I absolutely love that feature because I am not a cat groomer, I am a nursing student who just wants to keep my cat's nails short so they don't get caught on anything when they are walking or playing around or even on me! I am sure everyone can relate when they say they are kind of scared to trim their own pet's nails because you don't want to cut them too short but these products seriously change your life because they make sure you won't cut them too short! These products save me time, money, and keep my cat's happy because I get to cut their nails from my home!
Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review but I honestly really love all of these products and they work amazing! The grinder is so quiet you can barely here it and I first tested it out on my own nails and it worked amazing!  Plus the grinder comes with batteries, just remove the plastic and install them in and your all set! Also my cats weren't afraid of it so that was another plus! If you need pet clippers or a pet grinder this is the pet nail grooming kit you need in your life!",1

"I received this magnetic car vent cell phone holder on time and in a nice packaging.  Unlike other products, it has good flexibility to turn around and can be easily adjusted to face you at the angle that you want.  The magnet disk is mounted on an sphere base which allow it to rotate 60 degrees in one direction and 360 degrees in another, hence giving the flexibility of adjustment.  It comes with two metal plates (one circular and the other one rectangular) that can be put between on back of your phone covered by the phone case.  Please see attached pictures.  The magnetic holder can be inserted into the vent of can and the magnet is strong enough to keep my iPhone 6 plus in place.  It looks nice and seems to be made of good quality material.  I received this item at discount for review.  I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it to family and friends.  It make a nice gift as well.",1

I have been using it a little over a month and it hasn't let me down at all.  I can easily say that I have used it at least 40 - 50 times and I have not had a problem with anything sticking. Today I have used it 3 times.  I made pancakes this morning, grilled cheese for lunch for the kiddo and then I reheated some chicken wings (threw in a pat of butter and re-fried my wings then threw on some hot sauce and let it cook down).  I added a video showing my pan after I cooked the wings and let it cool down.  I just ran hot water over the dirty pan and it rinsed out.  I always let my pan cool off before cleaning it with hot water and some dawn soap.
My standard cooking oil is coconut oil and I use it every time I cook in this pan.  Coconut oil is a healthy oil and about 40 calories for a teaspoon. I usually use 1/3 -1/2 tsp. The pan is made very well and and comes in at 35 ounces so it's not overly heavy.  The handle is very comfortable to hold and is balanced nicely.  It also comes with a little sheet with a lot of useful information.  You can put your pan in the oven but not in an excessive hot oven.  Don't put cold water in your hot pan overtime it may crack. Also, don't use sharp objects in your pan as you may scratch it.
Overall, I love this pan.  I have plans to purchase additional pans and possibly a lid.

"I Love this shirt, The fabric is very soft and flowing. It is weightless and just drapes perfectly. I think I am going to have to order this in several other colors! The v-neck is very nice! I received this case for free or at a discount for my HONEST review! I do not believe in anything but honest reviews!

 - I love this product. it meets or exceeds my expectations and is great quality. I would recommend this to anyone.
 - I like this product but its is not perfect. The quality is good and is as described, but it could use some improvements. I would recommend this to friends and family.
 - This product is okay but it could be better. The quality is acceptable but it could use some improvements to make it better. I would recommend this to friends and family but advise of my thoughts about quality.
 - This product did not impress me at all. It either does not work as described, is of poor quality, or is just not what I was expecting it to be. It might be okay for some people who are just looking for something cheaply made or inexpensive to purchase.
 - I do not like this product. It is either very poor quality, a waste of time and money, or did not arrive in a timely manner. I would not recommend this product to anyone as it does not meet the quality standards of anyone and should be removed from amazon.

"I have a opossum/squirrel problem at my garbage bins that have left chewed holes on my garbage lids in order to get food. It's hideously loud! The noise is fake gun shots (pow,pow).

The forst time it did that I almost ducked for cover. LOL This also flashes a light as well to help deter them. I don't think I'll have this out there very long maybe 30 days then move it elsewhere.

"Based on the reviews about this shoe's ""large"" width, I thought it would not fit me since I have narrow feet! I normally wear an 8 but my size wasn't available and went with a 7.5 and it is actually a great fit! It seems like it will end up being a comfy shoe too!  My thin foot fits great & there is no gapping around the top of my foot. The only thing I wish is that an 8 was available because of the exact perfect fit regarding length & I like having a small space between my toe & the end of my open toed shoes. However, it fits & I'm so happy to wear these sparkly gold wedges to my nieces wedding!",0
"I love this emergency solar radio power bank. It can be charged by solar, a power cord or a hand crank. It has AM/FM/WB on it. You can charge a phone or a tablet. It has a flash light on it also. I keep mine in my camper. I received this product for my unbiased review.",1

"The noise-cancellation didn't work as well as I expected. something plugged into the port on it reduced internet speeds down from ~20 Mb/s to about 18 Mb/s and a full power strip plugged into the port reduced speeds by more than 50%.

Also not sure if it's the fault of the powerline adapter or the house's circuitry, but I was only able to cap out at speed of around 23 Mb/s when a direct ethernet connection to the router yields 80 Mb/s. This adapter advertises 200Mbps, but my results don't currently support that.",0

"I have to admit that I didn't have high expectations when I ordered this umbrella.  Probably because I have never owned a high quality umbrella.  Needless to say, this umbrella far exceeded my expectations.  We live in the Houston area and have had tons of rain the past few weeks so I had several chances to try this out.  I really like this umbrella.  The button to operate is very handy and actually works.  Additionally the spokes (?) didn't get tangled up when opening, closing, or while I was walking in the wind.  It is a nice size when expanded.  It covered both me and my son when we walked close together.  I would definitely recommend this to others.
I received this umbrella at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest opinion. I did not receive any compensation for my review. I am a fanatical online shopper and rely heavily on others feedback. As a result, I take great pride in providing an HONEST assessment.

"This is a cool shirt/tunic. First of all, while the product's name would suggest this item can be worn as a dress, I think it is way too short for that (I'm 5'7'', not particularly tall). The actual length is of a shirt or tunic. Based on the pictures though I kind of expected it to be very short, so no real disappointment there. I really liked the colors and patterns on the pictures, and the red/black design looks really great, with bright, flashy colors even after the first wash. The tunic was delivered very quickly and in perfect condition. No issues with the stitching or quality otherwise. I expected the fabric to be a little lighter based on the picture and the beachwear label, instead it is a very stretchy and thick-ish fabric that is not see through at all. I wear a size 12/14 in tops, and this fits perfectly. It might not fit someone who wears a larger size though, or it would be very tight on the stomach and hips.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair an unbiased review. If my opinion changes in the future after more wear, I will make sure to post an update.",1
"I was completely and utterly thrilled to get this 2 pack of magnetic car mounts from Mengo! These mounts feature a pleasant simple, attractive, unique and extremely compact design. There is a nice Mengo logo branded on the mount, so if you hate logos these might not be right for you..

These Mengo magnetic vent mounts are super easy and stress-free for anyone to set up and get going. In my case, all I had to do was to remove the case off my iPhone 5s and then place the magnetic plate that came with the mount in between my iPhone and the case. I then put my case back on my iPhone. Now the mount is completely assembled and ready to go. Finally you simply insert the magnetic mount into your vent. Now you can simply just put your phone on the mount and you're all ready to hit the road.
t
I have to say that the magnets in these Mengo mounts seem to be rather powerful; as you can feel the magnets will start to pull the phone in at around half an inch away from the mount. The mount keeps my iphone secure while on the rough roads and driving over the crater sized potholes we have here in northern New Jersey. I also really like that this mount has the ability to swivel to get that perfect viewing angle. I will most definitely recommend this mount to anybody looking for this type of magnetic car mount.

There is really only one con to these types of mounts that I could think; and it's that if you have to use your heat and don't have the ability to shut off the vent then your phone will most likely wind up overheating within 10-15 minutes. It is not a big deal for me though.

Aside from that, it went on very easily, and I have not had any problems with it yet. thanks for a great product.",1
"I love the fact that the screen protector is really just a screen protector so it just protects your screen is not something with protection from damages are really chips or anything like that it just protect your screen from scratches. Listen protector covers your screen from edge to edge and you barely have any gaps between the ages of the phone and Clarity is not reduced at all I really enjoyed using this product on my phone and I did share one with one of my friends and they also gave the items really good reviews. The screen protector and dear to the screen of a phone really well and minor blemishes if there were any on the phone screen itself for actually hidden and therefore help to make a poorly makeup or really looking screen look a lot better than what it actually was I do recommend this for anyone that's looking something simple to cover their phone.

"I have a similar backpack to this one in checkered RED. I purchased this back pack strictly to the idea that it was very similar to my old backpack and the color was different and matched with multiple outfits. After receiving it the first thing that I did was compare and contrast to my old backpack and to my surprise it was IDENTICLE just a different brand.

The way the backpack is configured it just looks very attractive. On the outside there is a smaller pocket where pencils, mini stapler, pens can be put as for the main backpack the cool feature about this is that It has a built in laptop holder/carrier. You can place your laptop in this soft padded section in the backpack where it will be safe! (Back pack is advertised as water proof). I used to own a MacBook pro which would easily fit into my bag 13 inch. However my new laptop is a little bigger and it won't fit so I just use this pocket to carry random things when I am in a hurry I can even stuff my papers in there. On the other side of the backpack holder it has room from your books, notebooks, binders everything you need to be successful at school! Overall it is an awesome backpack and I greatly recommend it to everyone that needs one! I received this item at a discounted price in return for an unbiased review.",1

Even though the description says it does!!!!  Buyer beware!!!",0
"Awesome foam roller. I bought this as a travel roller as I already own a longer one. The travel bag is a nice touch and the roller itself is a great size for portability. In fact, since I received this I haven't used my other one even when I'm not traveling.

My only complaint is the bag feels like it's just a little too tight of a fit. It took some getting used to fitting the foam roller back in it. Other than that, I've really enjoyed it so far. I highly recommend it!

"Exceptional Style

The case is well made. I hoped that it would work better. It has everything that I would need to include my telephone in, put charge cards, drivers permit and even cash. Everything lines up impeccably, for example, the camera gap for taking photographs, link to match up the telephone and everything else. The issue that I have is you can't generally chat on the telephone while you have the case on. It acts as a burden as it is massive. On the off chance that the case was some way or another compliment that may help, yet it acts as a burden for me.

"My son absolutely loves this bracelet. it fits perfect and he enjoys wearing this anchor. He says it reminds him how I keep him grounded and level headed. It reminds him of the ocean and of our family's heritage. It reminds him of his great grandfather who was a master ship builder and shrimper / fisherman. This bracelet has become a precious token to my son.

I am thankful to have found this for him so he can have something to cherish.
This is a gorgeous bracelet. It arrived in a very protected package. It came with a very nice drawstring ""HITOP Jewelry "" bag. This bag holds the item perfectly. I believe it will help save the luster and beauty of this bracelet for years to come.
The bracelet itself is very well made. Each strand is perfectly placed to showcase each beautifully made charm. It has a claw hook and an extended chain for closure to fit any size wrist. This bracelet is absolutely beautiful. It would be a great gift for a friend, family member, or even just a treat for yourself. This bracelet is timeless and does not look to be for any specific age range. Anyone could wear this bracelet and get compliments.
All in all, it's a beautiful piece of art to wear every day or for those special occasions. I would absolutely buy more, (which I have ;-) ) !!!

The only think that I don't really like is that the edges don't go up over the side of the screen even a little bit so I think that if the phone fell just right it might shatter the screen. Also the color isn't quite the same as in the picture, it's a little darker, but I still think it's a very attractive case.",0

I wanted just a plain band to wear everyday so my expensive wedding set did not take a beating. I am always sticking my hands in bleach water when cleaning the house.  I found this one and saw it came in my size and decided to give it a try.  The ring does not look like a white gold band as the picture shows. The ring itself is shiny but looks more sterling silver color than white gold.  I just was expecting more on the white gold look like the picture.  The  ring itself is a nice ring and will give me a lot of wear. It is shiny and it fits wonderfully.  It has the comfort fit on the inside of the band. The edges are smooth. It has the company logo printed inside with titanium. The logo of the heart gives it an elegant look. I have had compliments on the ring.  I did receive the ring at a discount for a honest unbiased review.  The ring is nice and has a very smooth fit.  It slides right on and you actually forget you have it on.  I am happy I decided on it even with the color difference.,1

"I purchased the Rnker dog collar in a size small in the hopes that it would be a good fit for my larger cat. I don't normally collar my cats, but this one wandered away for several days and lost her way. She is not the brightest crayon in the box, so I needed the peace of mind in case it happened again.

When it arrived, I was vey pleased with the high quality material and beautiful floral design. Adjusting the collar size was very easy, as was opening and closing the collar. What I liked most was the padded interior for added comfort of the pet. This was the first collar I was able to put on my cat that she actually kept on without a problem or complaint. So far I am extremely pleased with this purchase and would buy another collar from this company again if needed.

"My daughter told me one day, ""I want a hammock<"" so I said, ""I think I can arrange for that.""  And this is the one I bought.  My daughter is on vacation with her mother right now, but I told her I got this, and she was excited.  I put it up in my house in a large opening between rooms (see attached photo), and it's strong enough to withstand my weight (about 230 lbs), so it'll certainly hold up my daughter.  I can't wait for her to see it and lay down in it.

It's also pretty cool that it comes with a storage bag that is actually attached to the hammock itself--very handy.

"I've been using computers forever for keeping track of things, but to date, there really isn't anything that beats good old paper and pencil for small business bookkeeping.  I got this on the recommendation of my tax accountant (I was using Quick Books), and I have to admit, I'm spending significantly less time doing my bookwork that using the computer.  It's a simple, straight forward format that keeps records well.  To track my businesses profits and loss, etc.  I use basic math, and have a simple program for customer statements.  While this won't work for everyone, I think most small businesses making under $150k who do their own books will find this works great--for less than $15~!

"Easy to install and fits great.  I would classify this type of film as a ""case friendly"" as there is a small gap on all sides that will ensure that unlike other full coverage films that it will not pop up and off of your phone when you put it in a case.  The packaging that this product came with was excellent and the instructions were very clear and detailed to make installation a breeze.  I was able to install this film with ease and even though I have 2 extra films in case of an accident I didn't need to use those at all. This film looks great on my phone and zero bubbles are on it.  It is very clear and the feel is just like glass, which I truly like. This film is thicker than some others out there, but it makes it feel like I have so much more protection on my screen and will keep my phone safe.

I did receive this product for free for my honest review.  I would highly recommend this screen protector for those who want to protect their screen as well as to keep a case on their phone without having to worry about the film peeling up.  Even if you don't use a case, I would feel confident in recommending iCarez branded screen protectors.",1
"The PowerKey Lightening Keychain Charger is very convenient and useful.  It is the perfect size to carry around. I attached it to my keychain so that I will always have a charging option for my iPhone 6s and iPad. I  have not had any issues with charging my devices. This product charges just as speedy as the original apple chargers. I like that I can use it in a car if I don't have a charger. Most cars these days have the option of plugging into a USB connection for charging so this KeyChain is perfect as it has the USB connection. I do a lot of driving for my job and it is usually in a rental car so now I don't have to worry about finding a charger and can use my GPS and make calls and not have to be concerned about a low battery.
The charger can be plugged into the computer or a charging block to charge your device.
The PowerKey Lightening Keychain Charger is packaged in a nice box that makes for easy gift giving. It will make a nice gift for most anyone and these days most anyone has a smart phone so buy several and keep on hand as  they will be great last minute gifts, will be appreciated and used.  I am very pleased with the convenience of this charger. I don't have to think about a charger when traveling as there  is always a computer that I can plug into.  Great product..

This tee shirt is a little bit on the large size. My husband requires a 2X because even though he is on the slim side he has very large broad shoulders and a muscular neck/arms and a very long torso. Most 2X fit him great and this one does too but it is a little more on the wider side. Still it is tall enough for him and fits in the shoulders. He loves this because his 2 daughters truly do make his world go around! I received this product in exchange for an honest review.,1
"Love the color! Fit is comfortable, not sure if they would give enough support for some sports but for biking and walking they are great!",0
"The case is great if you like a minimalist style as I do. It covers all the important parts while providing a comfortable solid grip, with just enough raised lip to protect your screen. However, a drop that falls face down is not going to have much protection if any.",0
"Im not an artist or even that experienced with coloring / art, I just know when I like something (or I don't like something). And, I like these. The first time I pulled the magenta/pink color out of the box I loved how it just glided across the paper, and how saturated the color was.

This is the largest set of colored pencils I have, and it provides so many color choices. I also like that the pencils are numbered so if I find one I really like (or if I stop a drawing halfway through), I can come back after making a note on which number I used.

The box can be a bit tough to visualize the pencils from, so you may find you need to dump them all out on the table. (I prefer the tubes as you can keep everything tidy and still see the pencils).

"I'm glad that I read the reviews before I ordered this because if I had ordered my usual medium it would have been way too small. I ended up getting the XXL and it is perfect. The fabric itself is very sheer so you will need to wear a tank top under it, but I really like the layered look so that's fine by me. It looks like it can be used for either casual or  dressy depending on how you accessorize. Just remember to order way larger and you should be fine with size.

"Really like this cable. I wrote a review for a displayport to dvi cable made by the same company. I am happy to say my experience is the same with the display port to hdmi cable. It works as intended. I have the display port connected to my pc and the dvi to a TV. I extend the display to the tv so when I want to play my games on a nice big screen I can. It works without any problems. There isn't much more you can ask for so I recommend it.

"Other than the small cosmetic blemish on these, all around a solid pair of economy headphones that deliver acceptable sound quality and above par comfort. They are a little too small for my big head, but my partner has been using them non-stop for the last two days. She loves that she can fold them up and throw them in her bag, and that they don't have any obnoxious colours or branded logos anywhere. Packing is great and would make for an awesome gift for non-audiophiles out there.

I will be taking some more photos after another week of use, just to make sure no more pieces go missing!

"I wear size 10 women's shoes and the socks fit me perfectly. I'm on my feet at work from 4 - 8 hours per day. These socks provide a nice amount of compression so that I am not in agony at the end of my shift. The socks are comfortable to wear.

I like the pattern (I have the blue pair with the dots); they don't look like ugly compression socks, which is a plus.

At the moment, it's summertime here in the desert where I live, so I have put these socks aside until the temperature is less than 100 degrees. I can't stand to wear anything past my ankles in the heat, so my legs will have to be miserable for a few months.

"The Arctic Monsoon BBQ Digital Thermometer is a decent thermometer. It comes nicely boxed with good directions that include a doneness chart for different meats, if you don't know your donenesses this can be very helpful. In culinary school I was taught to tell doneness by feel but in almost every commercial kitchen I have worked in doneness is gaged by actual temperature read with a thermometer very similar to this. Doneness by temperature is an industry standard. The Arctic Monsoon BBQ Digital Thermometer makes that easy to do at home. I tested the accuracy of the Arctic Monsoon BBQ Digital Thermometer by taking my (body) temperature with it (you could also test with boiling water or ice water) because that is a known temperature and it was accurate to the promised one degree +/-. The speaking feature is kind of hokey unless you are blind or grilling in the dark, then it is genius. The Arctic Monsoon BBQ Digital Thermometer takes two AAA batteries, that are not included. I didn't notice anything about that in the description but it is good to know.  Honestly the Arctic Monsoon BBQ Digital Thermometer is kind of cheaply made, maybe not the best quality. It is made of plastic that doesn't come together quite right, or at least mine doesn't. Actually it looks a lot like a talking Homer Simpson bottle opener my husband has if that gives you any clue to the quality I'm talking about. That being said it does work well, and does everything it advertises. **DISCLAIMER** I received this product free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This harness is well made, durable and has a stylish denim layer over the nylon. The stitching is neat and has double stitching near the stress spots. This tells me it is durable and will handle a pulling dog. The harness is a step in harness, which made it easy to put on my dog, simply by laying it flat and help feed his feet through the two loops. I then was able to buckle it up quickly and adjust it firmly to fit my dog by using the two adjustable straps on the sides. Make sure you measure your dogs girth to order the proper size, do not go by the weight.
I love that the harness is double layered not only for style, but for durability. It has 2 D-rings for more control while walking and for me, reassurance if the material started fraying and a d ring came off I still have one d ring hooked to the leash.
The harness I would recommend for training your dog not to pull. It did not stop my dog from pulling but is a great harness to train him not to. Also, he did not choke while he was pulling, which is a plus when it comes to harnesses.
One thing I did not particularly like was the leash. The leash measured at 4ft long, so that is a bit too short for my liking. It feels comfortable while handling but i prefer a leash that is 6ft. The length of the leash might be good for petite dogs.

My flights range from 4-6 hours, plus travel to/from the airport, so I put them on when I get to the airport and don't' take them off until I check into the hotel. High quality sound, not a ton of deep bass, but good bass nonetheless. Very light weight headphones too!",0
"It's soft, the neck is a bit big and it runs very small. My son only got to wear it twice which was sad. But it worked for what I needed it for, our Star Wars family photos because we're total nerds like that. I'll be hanging onto it for the next child because we do love it!",0
I received this product in exchange for an honest review. This is a super cute beach or pool cover up ! can be very versatile and worn in different ways... they even send you instructions on how to convert it into the different looks.  Its very sheer and light weight but well made.  I think that you could easily wear this in spring or summer with a cute dress or tank top and capris and achieve a very nice elegant look .  I think this will really some in handy this summer when entertaining by the pool ... your covered with this over your suit but stil :}l staying cool ... you won't feel like a prude in a parka. Overall I would recommend this scarf / shawl cover up... its a good buy for the money,1

"This organizer was much thicker than the regular ones I pick up from the local store. The acrylic is much thicker in the middle where everything connects. So instead of a thin acrylic it gradually goes from thicker to thinner. It has 2 tiers one taller and one shorter. It came wrapped in plastic so there were no scratches on it or anything. The first lower tier is the perfect height for lipsticks and lip glosses or chapsticks. The second tier is perfect for mascaras, glosses, eyeliners etc. Its perfectly clear so you can see everything inside. It is pretty sleek and with the clear acrylic it literally goes in any  room and blends in. The curved shape is kid of nice too. I can fit about 6 mascars in the top tiere and 3 lipsticks in each compartment of the bottom. It will fit more than that if you are using chapsticks or thinner lip glosses. The joints are slightly rounded so its easier to clean. I received a sample in exchange for an honest review.",1

"I just love these storage cubes! I can't believe it took me so long to actually get them!
They are very well made and from high quality materials. You don't have the odd strings sticking out like you see on the cheap Chinese clothing that you buy online.

They come in a pack of 6. They are collapsiple so you can just flatten them out when you're not using them.
They each have a handle in the front center which makes it easy to pull them out of your closet or shelf.
They have a reinforced bottom which looks very sturdy. I doubt it would hold heavy items like groceries but it is perfect for clothes. I put all my pairs of jeans in one cube - and my jeans are pretty heavy. The bottom didn't even give the impression of being strained.

I've rearranged my entire closet putting all the loose items in the cubes and all of a sudden I have so much more space.
I'm even considering getting one of those shelves specifically designed for the storage cubes.

"I received my Fit 2 directly from Samsung as part of a free promotion for early Note 7 purchasers and not from this vendor.  But I think for anyone purchasing the item they need to be aware of two things.  First, the design of the band it comes with can result in the watch falling off your wrist and you being unable to find the piece which caused the issue.  This happened to me today in the gym when I was lifting weights and the watch suddenly flung off my wrist onto the floor.  As it turns out, as you'll see from the pictures, Samsung's ""hook"" that is part of the band is not actually integrated into the band itself.  Mine detached but fortunately I was able to find it because I was in an environment with clean, flat floors.  I re-inserted it into the strap and continued my exercise, but am going to put super-glue on it to see if that works before wearing it again.  Secondly, the calorie counter function is somewhat misleading.  It's not quite smart enough to differentiate between when your walking versus working out using gym equipment.  I know based on the number of reps and weight I'm using I'm burning a substantial number of calories, but the watch doesn't reflect it.  The device is probably better used for walking, as in counting the number of steps and estimating calories burned from this particular activity. As an aside, there seems to be some algorithm in place to estimate the number of calories burned in a resting state because I've seen the counter slightly increase just while watching TV, but the main issue is computing calories burned in non-walking forms of exercise.  Overall I like the product; it's cool the way it monitors your heart rate and can detect certain movements, allows you to manually track the number of glasses of water you intake for the record, etc. but it can't be super accurate in all functions. Please let me know if you found this review helpful.",1

"This is a very cute top.
And it is extremely comfortable. So comfy in fact that I'm not sure if I should wear it to lounge about at home or if I should wear it out. I love that it's so light and airy. It's also roomy because I sized up one size and am glad I did. The info says it's made of rayon and spandex but I am expecting it to shrink a bit in the wash.
Even if it doesn't, I think I prefer it looser due to comfort. I like the little knot on the bottom. It's adds a dressy and unique edge to this piece. I ordered it in Aqua which is a great summer time color. Because I ordered it large it doesn't hug my hips the way it does in the picture. So if that is the look you prefer then I wouldn't size up. Mine hangs loosely at the bottom but sits very well and properly upon my shoulders. I'll probably pair it with a summer tank top, some cotton shorts and strappy saddles.

"Disclosing from go, this item was provided for sampling purposes at a reduced or at no cost. I try to maintain objectivity, but if you see a problem with this in any way, please skip the review (hence placing this at the beginning).

We have been working on trying to grow our own indoor plants, and it is amazing how much different indoor growth is versus outdoor. With indoor, there are a number of factors you have to control for, ranging form humidity to lighting and beyond. You also have to provide the correct type of lighting, and you need to do so without the wrong type of heating associations.

What is great with this is that it has a smaller profile and manages to add everything you want and need, and at a power-reducing minimum. It is VERY easy to mount and hangs correctly despite different areas and placement, and you do not have loads of heat being produced so you do not have to worry about wilting something while trying to give it lighting, about heating an area haphazardly, and about safety considerations. That is what I like about LED, period, because you are always talking savings and you are also talking lighting without finding yourself exposed to some increased safety risk. LED lighting also last a LOT longer than typical light sources, which means savings and a consistent performance. If you need to put it on a switch or a timer, you also do not have to worry about the on/off cycle causing the lighting to give out prematurely (i mention a switch since there is no on/off switch).

Some specs:
Led : 225 LED lights: 165 Red LED lights (630nm Wavelength) + 60 Blue LED lights (465nm Wavelength).
Power: 14W
Suggested Irradiated Distance: 1.64ft-3.28ft /0.5m-1m
Irradiated area: 26.9 square feet/2.5 square meter",1
"This is an awesome idea but not if you plan on growing an actual tree.

I live in Chicago. We get brutal winters here and very short summers. The seed will grow but unfortunately I can house a tree.

We plan on moving to Texas so I'll definitely be able to plant the seeds from this tray into a pot or perhaps the ground. This is great for places with warmer climates where you can plant your tree. Not so great for tundras.

You get everything you need. No need for toothpicks.

This is a great way to start up a baby tree. I'm sure there are avocado seeds that grow into small trees that can be home but I don't know the slightest way of figuring that out.

Can be reused so you can grow your little seedlings more than once.

It's very unique and fun way to grow an avocado tree!

"I have played around with this cable for a few days and i can't fault it at all.

The packaging I can't fault its typical Anker and great straight to the point easy to get the cable out.

Build quality is excellent the cable itself is nice and smooth and comes with two Velcro straps that is great for cable management, The long cable is great for charging and using the phone at the same time.

I have tested the cable with a Nexus 6P and my USB 3.0 port on my computer. I managed to get 16.4 MB/s transferring a 4.7GB file to the Nexus 6P. This is a lot faster then a standard USB connection. This was consistent between Windows and Ubuntu.

It will also charge the Nexus 6P on AC charging or Full speed charging if connected to a 5V 2000mAh or higher charger so you can connect this to any USB outlet. I tested this with a Anker PowerPort 5 and its great.

Cant fault it at all great cable and will be using it as the daily driver cable as we have not got any USB C chargers floating around and this makes pure sense.

I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.",1
"This is the second case I have gotten from this company.  I had a hard time getting this case on my phone, but once I got it on there I have not wanted to take it off.  This quickly became my favorite case.  The black of the inner rubber part of the case matches my phone so well.  The hard plastic part is a metallic pink color that I love.  Since I have had it on my case, I have dropped my phone off of a check stand counter at WalMart.  I was so happy that nothing broke on my phone.  The only bad thing about this case is that I cannot plug in my speakers with the cords that the speakers came with.  But other than that, I love this case.

"Before I buy any color ink jet printer, I always check to see if there are any reliable third party aftermarket replacement ink cartridges.  Although some time you may find a good printer for your needs, replacement ink cartridges can add up and end up costing more than your printer after the first or second refill.

I got the MG6620 this past Christmas and these were the first replacement ink cartridges I bought for my printer.  The color quality and photos are at least equal to the ones that came with my printer and I am happy with the results.  So far I have been through almost all the cartridges in the 12-pack and so far the color reproduction has been consistent.  They are easy to install and are no different than the ones provided by my printer brand.  As long as these ink cartridges are available as replacements - I will be using them with my printer till it dies.

"This Motoraux Visor 3D Virtual Reality Glasses is a good performance 3D VR glasses. It is a major improvement over the Google cardboard 3D VR glasses. It has more adjustability for a more comfortable wear, clearer view, and less dizziness. It works perfectly with my iPhone 6. The headset is comfortable to wear with great support from the thick padding and head straps. It has soft ventilated foam padding around the eye.  It has adjustable head strap to securely attach the headset to your head. The elastic straps are wide to provide great support on your head.

This 3D VR headset is very adjustable with focal distance and sight distance dials. It provides great adjustable image quality. If you are seeing two objects you can adjust the focal length to merge the two objects into one. You can adjust the sight distance to get a clear focused image. I can use this 3D VR headset much longer without getting dizzy when compared to my old Google cardboard goggles. The lid uses a magnetic to hold the lid closed. It makes opening and closing the lid very easy. Inside the lid there are padding to hold your phone.  Overall, this is a good performance 3D VR headset. It is a major improvement over the Google Cardboard headset. It has much adjustability for focal distance and sight distance for clearer and better image quality.

"I love love love these (but there's a but). When I got these out of the package I was so excited. They're really beautiful. All six of my coasters were the same size (but all unique with just a little different shape). The wood part that is exposed is nice and smooth. They are rustic and look perfect with my decor in my living room. My one complaint is that two of the six coasters came with bark chipped off. In other words, about 1/4 - 1/2 of the bark was not on the outside rim of the coaster. I'm not a perfectionist and can live with it; especially because these have a rustic and imperfect feel. I wouldn't expect perfection, but I do wish, in this case, that the bark went all the way around. Overall happy with my purchase and would buy again.

Update: I've had these for a few months now and use them rarely (just because we don't have company over often and don't need them) and one of the six, has had bark fall off. I still love this product and am leaving my four star rating, but just wanted to let you guys know. If you have kids that might bang these up, the bark will probably fall off (at least some of it).

"I purchased the LG G4 Screen Protector,TANTEK [Bubble-Free][HD-Clear][Anti-Scratch][Anti-Glare][Anti-Fingerprint] Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for LG G4,[Lifetime Warranty]-[1Pack]. The packaging was great, it was done in such a way that it would be very difficult to damage the screen. The directions were easy to follow, I had no complications putting the screen on my phone.
Only problem I had was that it is advertised as ""Anti-Fingerprint"", however this is not the case. You could clearly see my finger prints/ smudges from my fingers. Now the finger prints show up less than other screen protectors, how ever they still show, so it isn't ""Anti-Fingerprint"". But overall a great screen protector.

"This has been a good light for my aquarium!  It is easy to use right out of the box.  I slid the arms in and attached and plugged in the power cord and it was ready to go.

The LED's are bright enough to light all the way to the bottom of my previously dark 30 gallon Hex tank.  It has a white or blue light setting.  I prefer the white light so I can see into the tank a little better.  I don't have any live plants so I'm not sure how this works for an aquarium with plants.

It is lightweight and the quality seems to be pretty standard for this price point. I wish there were something to keep the arms from coming completely out of the holes on each side.  I'm afraid one will stretch too far when I'm cleaning the tank and the light will fall right in!

Overall, I'm very satisfied with this light.",0

"The 460 has a little more oomph than the hugely popular 455. It has an adjustable oiler (3 settings - lo, mid, hi). Several reviews suggest setting the oiler to high, but I found it was not necessary, and furthermore, doing so causes the bar oil to run out much faster than the fuel, so you will find yourself stopping more often to refill.

The saw has good power and ergonomics. It is made with plastic parts, and is clearly not as sophisticated or powerful as the more expensive saws made by Husqvarna, but it still cuts great, and is very forgiving on the wrists due to the anti-vibe hardware. Be warned: it is bulky, and heavy, and if you are lugging it around with you all day, you will definitely grow weary. Also, 20-inches is really the best bar length for this machine. It provides good cutting depth with an excellent balance of power, without pushing the engine beyond its comfortable limits. This model is also sold with a 24-inch bar, but I would not recommend it, you would not be pleased with its performance using that setup.

Unlike the 435 and other Huskies, this saw does not come with a reusable air filter. You will have to buy new and replace them periodically. However, the patented X-torq airflow system really does an awesome job of keeping all but the finest debris away from the filter, ejecting particles out of the engine housing. If you're cutting 10 cord of wood annually, then your air filter will be fine for a long time. The air filter cover is held in place with philips head screws, which have plastic retainers to keep them from falling or getting lost when you remove the cover.

Package comes with a bar, chain, scrench, and plastic bar cover. I HIGHLY recommend that you use premium, non-ethanol gas with this saw. Trust me, I am not being a snob when I say that. These machines run much, much better when you give them the right fuel, and they also run cooler, which prolongs engine life.

All in all, I am pleased with this purchase. This saw is clearly a home owner/semi pro machine, not a powerful logger saw, but for what it is intended, it is awesome. It has a handful of quirky little drawbacks but they do not prevent it from being a good addition to your tool shed. For the price of $420, I found it to be well worth it.",0
"Piece of junk, don't buy it! Looks like a heavy protective case and what arrives is a cheap piece of plastic with no tempered glass.

"This item is awesome. Exactly what I was looking for. I do home visiting and have wanted a way to offer a little more privacy when clients are calling my phone. This item is perfect. It came with the application materials that made it easy to clean the screen and apply the shield. It is a lot darker than I realized, which has its pros and cons. The con is that I generally have to have the brightness up higher than normal to be able to see through it. However, the pro is that it works awesome for privacy! When it is tilted to the side, you can't see the screen at all. This is awesome for privacy! It is thicker than I thought and I know it will hold up well. The 3 items each came in their own package, which is great for me because then I can store them for later. I would definitely buy these again and recommend them for others who are seeking some privacy for their phones.

"I ordered this bracelet as a gift for my dad, and he loved it. The wider band fits him better than other paracord bracelets we have bought.

When we first opened the package, the fishing gear was not immediately apparent. We were all pleasantly surprised when Dad realized it was tucked inside the weave of the bracelet itself. Amazing, really. I had assumed it would be in a separate packet, perhaps connected in some way like the fire starter. You couldn't possibly get the fishing gear out, let alone back in. Of course, that's the point of it!

Seriously, this bracelet is an essential for anyone who will be hiking, camping, or doing anything where they run the risk of being lost.

The compass is large enough that it's easily visible, and worked well.

The whistle is piercing, when he blew it the dog came running.

The magnesium rod is the center pin of the buckle. How neat is that? I love things that are efficiently and cleverly made.

I'm beyond glad to have gotten this item, and plan to buy everyone in the family one at some point.

"You'd think pencil sharpeners would just work, but sadly, I've purchased about 7 that completely suck. Either chewing up the pencil to smithereens or sharpening too much and the leads fall out or just jamming. This sharpener actually works pretty well. I like the option of batteries or USB. I have mine on USB since I'm perpetually out of batteries. So far colored pencils as well as standard no. 2 pencils that sharpen smoothly and the lead stays in. I like the safety feature that the shavings case has to be closed for it to work. This also comes with an extra blade and a ridiculously small and cute tool to use to replace it. So far happy with this. I received this free to test and provide a genuine review from my personal use and experience.",1

"UPDATE 10/01/2016:
While I am keeping the 4 star review because the camera still works just fine for my needs I feel I have to update the review as the battery no longer holds a very good charge.  The unit never was designed to run for hours on a charge, only a few minutes if it was triggered in the off mode by a G-shock of the sensor.  However now when there is a g-shock it does turn on, and it does record for a few seconds but it starts chiming almost immediately warning that the battery is low.  Again, it hasn't changed my mind much about the product.  I still feel like it's about as solid as you will find at this price.

This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

I've been looking into buying a dash cam for a while and recently with more urgency now that my Mobius battery is toast.  I came across this unit and figured I'd give it a go.

The box presents the product very well and gives the impression that you've just purchased a quality product.  The dash cam housing is nice and solid.  It is not made entirely of plastic, the front of the camera is actually metal (the matte black part) and gives the device a bit of heft.  The buttons are firm but easy to press and give a nice responsive ""click"" when pressed so there is no confusion if you've hit the button or not.

The connection points on the device are the HDMI monitor/output, the mini-USB, GPS input, four pin quick mount and the MicroSD slot (16GB Micro SD included was nice).  I would have liked to of seen a more modern communication/power port than mini-usb especially with a new product but it gets the job done well enough.

The windshield mount has a four pin quick connection which is a nice addition but I am not sold on the release clip, it is a small plastic clip that looks like it might be a failure point.  Time will tell.  The entirety of the unit is a bit bulky and not easily hidden from view especially in a car that has the ""third visor"" with those little dots making it so the suction cup won't stick for long forcing you to move it lower.  However it does not interfere with your view, it is well hidden behind my rear view mirror.  I'm inclined to take it down when I park my car for periods of time in open parking lots but it's a double edged situation.  On one hand I want to keep the device out of sight so as to not encourage a thief to break into my car but on the other hand I want to keep it mounted due to the ""park sensor"" that records if a g shock is detected while off which turns the camera on and records for a few seconds.  Most times I leave it in unless I park in a less than favorable area.  Odds are I'll forget its there as it's meant to be an autonomous ""when you need it it's there"" product.

The menu is very user friendly and intuitive.  The first menu gives you image resolution options, image quality, anti-flicker, loop settings, sensor options, microphone on/off and a few others.  The second menu gives you language options, system (PAL/NTSC), driver ID settings, date/time, formatting, reset, power, gps, sound and other settings.  Navigation is done using the buttons on the bottom of the unit using a left and right arrow, a menu button and an ok button.  Switching between camera modes is accomplished by pressing the mode button on the bottom.

Use of the camera is pretty straight forward.  After you select your resolution and image quality it is pretty much autonomous.  The device powers up when it senses power and starts recording.  If it detects a ""G"" shock it will flag it as important and save it in a folder that can't be over written by the device itself and only deleted by the user.  Same thing goes if the unit is off and the park sensor is activated, it will save a short clip to the ""event"" folder on the device (the sensor is very sensitive and will likely be set off by your car door shutting).  Otherwise it just records on a loop overwriting the oldest file if the card fills up which it can rather quickly depending on image quality settings.  When the vehicle is turned off the camera shuts down about 15 seconds later.

Video quality is impressive to say the least.  Amazon video doesn't do it justice but I may upload a video once I can create a good comparison between different settings. I like the 1920x1080 HDR 30fps setting using ""Fine"" image quality, it gave me a good amount of recorded video that spanned multiple days of traveling back and forth to work and a couple of errands.  Plenty for my needs.  I did try the 1920x1080 60fps using ""Super Fine"" quality and found that it only gave me a couple days of recordings and the image quality was just marginally better, though playback was considerably smoother with the 60fps but it's not like I'm making a movie with the thing, just need it for driving records.  Also found that the unit got a bit hot using the 60fps super fine settings but not when using 30fps HDR with fine quality. Pausing the video during a 50MPH drive still gave clear enough images to read other vehicle license plates while passing on the road.

Also found that the 2560x1080 resolution is all but useless as it crops the image to create the resolution.  1920x1080 is the way to go for maximum quality and minimal file size.

The microphone is pretty good and picks up most things in the car.  Also seemed to do a good job picking up my voice over hard rain on the windshield or louder than average music.  Not that the microphone is what I invested into this product for but it was a pleasant surprise.

The battery is minimal. It does run for a decent while without power but will shut off after an hour or so without being plugged in.  It does not appear to be replaceable, at least not without voiding the warranty.  Plenty for saving settings.  Yet to be seen how long it will last in a hot car, the device says it can handle high temperatures but we will see.

Everything about this device has impressed me in one way or another.  The real reason for me giving a four star rating is the windshield mount.  I would have loved to have an option other than the suction cup.  I've got no problem sticking some industrial 3M tape to my windshield if it means I could mount it higher up and more out of the way or maybe to the actual dash of my vehicle which would make using the quick disconnect clip much easier.  It's almost like the company spent so much time and effort designing the camera itself creating a really solid and easy to use product that when they got to the mount it was more or less a call in.  Still the mount does work, it is functional and appears to be of good quality meaning I don't expect any major failures.  Even if the quick connect clip fails that four pin mount is very tight so much so that the clip might not even be required.  The unit works, well enough that I'm buying another one for my wife's car.",1
"This is a very nice starter set for anyone who needs a nice matching set.  I personally like this because of the matching clip, tie and cuff links. These are not the best quality but these are perfect for me.  The tie is not a normal sized tie but a skinny tie.  Over all i am very impressed with this set as it adds to my collection.

I got this product at a discount in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.  All opinions are my own.",1
"I was surprised at the quality of this set upon receiving it. I think that it is very well made. The seams are secure, the material is stretchy as well as surprisingly soft. I ordered the ""2XL-USL"", and it fits me fine, if not maybe just a tiny bit big. For reference, I am 5'7/170lbs/36-98 C or D depending on the manufacturer). I would normally wear a Large in lingerie. Some things to note, the babydoll top is very flowy, and the fabric is thicker than some others I own. The halter is one solid piece, there are no ties or clasps on the top. There is minimal support provided for 'the girls', so if you are bigger busted be aware of that, you're only being supported by elastic (there is no underwire or boning anywhere). The lace halter is also surprisingly soft, as others have mentioned this is something you could actually sleep in, unlike a lot of other lingerie which tends to be on the itchy/scratchy side. The undies are semi-adjustable meaning there is a loop sewn between the part that sits on your hips and the other part of the string. Overall, I think this is a lovely set and I'm very happy with it. I have already washed it (in a mesh delicate bag, tap cool water, gentle extra gentle cycle *light agitation/low spin, and hung it dry. It washed up fine, no rips/tears or loose threads to be seen. This would also make a really nice gift for a bride-to-be as well.

"Wonderfully packaged. Super fast delivery. These scrub pants are exactly as seller described. I hope to do business with this seller again! Thank You! These pants are nice! Thick, and rich in color! I've washed and dried them several times and they seem to resist fading very well. Very comfortable. Wonderful Scrubs! They stretch and give in all of the right places. Wonderful fit and attractive with the right pockets and stylish with the cargo look. Looking good while working hard. By far the best scrubs I have found.

My last one lasted 2 years before it stopped holding a charge as well. Definitly recommend to any traveler!",0
"I REALLY REALLY wanted to like this product, and there are pros and cons to be aware of,

Pros: Just one unit instead of 3 or 5-piece set.
Pros: The sound is pretty good considering that it comes from just the one unit
Pros: Bluetooth setup was a pieces of cake, and worked without issue with every device I ever paired to it.
Pros: The remote is a VERY nice remote and can be used with lots of different devices.  Just *feels* like really good quality.  The reality is that my X1 Xfinity remote, which has voice control was my preferred remote, so I only used this remote to change the Bass, the Speech enhancement or to pair a Bluetooth device.

CONS: Even though it was just one unit, it was BIG!  I expected it to be slightly larger than a sound bar, BUT it was massive in size, a big rectangle.  My flat screen is wall mounted and I have my cable box and other small devices on a floating shelf, but this speaker was massive compared to my Comcast cable box and ZERO chance of it fitting on that floating shelf.  Please check the dimensions to see if it will fit where you want to put it
CONS: The sound of this initially impressed me until I went to a friends place with a rather cheap sound bar and separate bass unit, and his sound put mine to shame, and his was cheaper.
CONS: There is NO user interface to be able to control the sound, no treble, needs an equalizer.  You can control Bass only.  I called Bose and was told that whatever device it is connected to will output the sound, so IF that device has an equalizer, then you CAN control that, so I download a couple of equalizer apps for my iPhone and sure enough, I COULD control how the sound came out, BUT the problem is that iPhone and iPad don't have a built-in equalizer app, so unless the sound specifically came from the apps I had purchased, I couldn't get the sound to be like I wanted.  This was a pain!
CONS: My Samsung TV has sound settings built-in, so I can adjust the sound from Dynamic, Movies, Surround, Dialog Enhancement, etc.  I could change the sound based on what I was watching, BUT that was ONLY when I used the TV as the output for the sound.  As soon as I changed the output to the Digital output for the Bose system, then all those options were grayed out.  So listening to my TV through the Bose, I had no option to change or enhance the sound to MY liking.  Why doesn't Bose have the ability either with a UI on the TV screen, or an app that will allow me to change the sound to the way I want it to sound?  Doesn't make sense!

In the end I decided to return this unit for a refund.  For the money, you can get better sound and lots more options.  Bose is a premium product and you are paying for the name and quality.  If Bose made some small changes, like being able to control the sound better via an app perhaps, I probably would have kept it.  Maybe the next iteration of this product will offer more features.  When I called Bose, they suggested that what I need would require me to upgrade to the $1500 unit.  So $449 versus $1,500 aren't even in the same playing field.  Sorry Bose.  I hope you read these comments and make some changes.

but I just couldn't keep it because of a couple reasons.",0
"I love the fit and color and mostly how soft this scrub top is. So nice. Quality seams and sewing. nice color...I got the blue. I love it and will be purchasing more of them.

"First of all I want to point out the ""buttons"" on this case. A lot of cases out there have ""buttons"" directly built into the case but they don't always work or you have to push them extra hard for them to work. The way that these buttons are designed on this case are designed perfectly so there are no issues. In one of the pictures I included with this review show what I'm talking about as it shows the inside of the case.

This is a great case for the Galaxy S7 so make sure that's the phone that you have if you want the case to fit perfectly. This will not work with other sized phones because each model is slightly a different size. There are cut outs for all the things you need, like the camera, audio jack, and charger. I feel like this is a rather thick case which I think is a good thing because that means the phone is going to be protected nicely.

"My kids love this pillow. I ordered it as a surprise and as soon as it arrived, they were thrilled. The quality is great. It's been sewn together nicely and its pretty thick. It's a great size, about 13-14 inches. It's perfect as a head pillow, or just for decorations. I love that it's different as well as trendy. I would order this again in the future.

"These are great for what I need. If problems with electronics can wrap them up for protection. Good for warmth in an emergency. Used to reflect heat off of air conditioner is my next plan. I've packed them in our emergency bucket. A few in our bug out bag. Four I put in camper for those cold nights so my feet won't half freeze. The size is perfect for that little extra warmth. In an emergency, could be life and death. Forgot to mention I put one in each truck. I received a discount for my honest review.  I explained to you the warmth factor, but they make a quick table cloth and for one with hole in it, my fault, our granddaughter was a super hero for the day. Mylar last a long time. I expect these to be reusable and last too.",1

"These mens diabetic non-binding, over-the-calf socks were really comfortable for my dad to wear. This size fit perfectly on his feet and every area of the sock was perfectly fitting. There wasn't a spot too tight or too loose. He also likes that the socks are dark black so they will be perfect to wear to the office on a cold day.

These socks are made of 80% cotton, 17% polyester, and 3% spandex.

The Pros:

1. High-quality stitching from the toe to the calf, although there were a couple loose strands around the opening of the socks.
2. My dad really liked that the socks are not 100% cotton and include some polyester and spandex to make them softer and more comfortable to wear.
3. The material is not really thin, but its not thick either, so your feet won't get too hot during the day.

The Cons:

1. None.

In Summary: These socks are up to standard in terms of quality of stitching. There are no areas of the sock too small or too large to be uncomfortable. In addition, the heel and angle of the sock is made correctly. If you're looking for non-binding, over-the-calf socks, then I would recommend this 3 pack by Grandeur Hosiery.

"Okay, traditional aerators have been out for awhile.  BUT these aerator pourers are AWESOME!!!  Wine drinkers know how an aerator should work and the older model of the aerator required two-hand operation and likely a decanter.  This new aerator pourer combines the convenience of aeration and a pourer with just one hand and straight into your wine glass!!! AWESOME!!!

Also, before funneling a fairly expensive dinner wine into the vergiano aerator pourer, I tested it with water to confirm that I can still hear the bubbling and I was able to visually confirm the sphiraling aeration of the water. My husband put the wine to the test and tasted aerated wine and a plain pour.  He confirmed that his cab tasted better through the aerator pourer!!!  Love love love it!!

Consider it as a gift for any wine lover or entertainer.

"The towels in this set are very soft and very absorbent. The towels almost look to good to be used and would be great as a decorative piece, but they work to good to be that. One thing to note is that this is a set of 3 towels, not a set of 3. You only get one bath towel one hand towels and one guest towel. Total of 3 not 9. The title is a little confusing.

"What a useful product!  I have never used stickers like this on anything but jars but I decided to also try them on other things this time to see if they would stick without damaging or falling off - see my photos!  In addition to canisters and kitchen jars, I put them wood, glass, and a painted wall.  They stuck easily and came off easily the next morning, without tearing or leaving a mark on the surface, and were able to be reapplied elsewhere.  Unlike other labels I have gotten before, these are very thick and did not curl when removing them.  The chalk markers were a nice thickness for writing and did wipe off easily the next day so they are reusable, as advertised.  I really like the matte finish!  These chalkboard stickers are really on-trend now for so many things, not just organizing kitchens, closets, and pantries! I will be using mine to organize storage in our attic and garage, kids toys, and our closets.  I have seen them used at weddings and showers,  store windows and menu boards, cheese board/buffet labels, goodie bag tags, etc.  This is a great value for 48 pieces!

"This is about the coolest case I've ever had.  It's actually two pieces. The wallet case has slots for ID and credit cards. In addition it  also comes with a protective cover for the phone, the back of which matches the wallet case. So, if you want to carry the phone without the case, it still has the cool back. When you want to put it back on the wallet case, it's held firmly in place with a magnet. It also comes with a carry wrist strap.  While it is a bit heavier than a regular wallet case due to the full magnet in the case and wallet, it's not so heavy as to be a problem.  It's just one great case.  The color is just as seen on the site and has a nice texture and sheen.  I've very happy with it. I received this at a special price for my honest and impartial review. But that being said I have already shown my friends and told them this is a great case. Hopefully it will hold up to extended use.  Looking at the material and stitching, I have no doubt that it will.",1

"I have another manufacturers Quick Charge 2.0 car charger, and when i bought my S7 Edge i used it with no issues of course as the Quick Charge x. 0 are all backward compatible. And the upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 is not massive. Yet it is an upgrade. I got this as i needed a USB Type C cable (for another purpose) and this actually came up on a search when i was looking, So for just a tad more i could get a new charger, and the cable. So win win right? Not so fast..

This listing shows the S7/S7 Edge as compatible, which is it, however the S7/Edge has a Snapdragon 820, which is QC 3.0 Compatible, the S7/Edge is not (software limited) so if you are looking for a charger for an S7/Edge, this will work, however ONLY at 2.0 speeds. So overall this was my mistake on not actually following my own advise below, and do your research to make sure your phone is compatible. I look at it as i swap between the Nexus series phones and the S# series phones, so when the Nexus phones come out this year, i can use this charger to the fullest potential, Until then, i can use the QC 2.0 feature of the S7. Once again, its not a huge difference, as seen below

For those not real familiar with the Quick Charge feature of these. Is it uses increased voltage based on the current charge of the phone, to get it back to around 80% as fast as possible, then lowers the voltage at is gets closer to 100% to not ruin the battery. However this only works on phones that have Snapdragon Processors, so be sure to confirm its use for your phone, as if you plug in a none compatible phone into the quick charge port it simply will not charge at all. Since the phone is what controls the charging, not the charger, Since QC is also backwards compatible. You can use a 3.0 charger on a 1.0 or 2.0 device, at those speeds. And if you do not have a QC device, you can use the additional port on this. Which is awesome!.

Quick Charge 1.0 is 5v at 10W
Quick Charge 2.0 is 5/9/12v at 18W
Quick Charge 3.0 is 3.2v - 20v Dynamic at 18W

30 min charge times from 0
Conventional - 18%
Quick Charge 2.0 - 63%
Quick Charge 3.0 - 71%

So as i stated, the change from 2.0 to 3.0 is not huge. However it is an upgrade for those devices that can use it.

Even after my mistake and the listing partially being misleading, I still feel this is a great investment for anyone with a current 2.0 or 3.0 device. One less thing to have to upgrade when you were to get a 3.0 device.

"Love it! It's beautiful. It seems to be a copy of a watercolor done on canvas. The colors are bright and vibrant.
I'm a little confused by some of the other comments I've seen. I don't believe it's misleading in anyway. It says watercolor so don't complain that it's ""fuzzy."" Water color is going to blend and bleed usually. For artwork with fine lines you would want a copy of an oil or acrylic painting. Also, no the paints don't come with this painting. It's not a kit. Personally I got exactly what I expected to get only was a little surprise how beautiful it is in person. I like that they shipped it rolled so there are no fold marks. Please beware this is canvas only and not framed!
It was for my room but my son loves elephants more than me so I will let him have it. We haven't framed it yet but my husband is going to use crap wood to wrap the caves around. I'm very excited to see it on the wall!

"This pillow case looks just like the picture. It's really a beautiful and detailed print. You can almost read the writing from a bit of a distance. The weave is a bit large and this has a rough-ish feel to it. I'm not sure I'd want to sleep on it, but it's cozy enough to sit with in a chair. It feels well made and sturdy and there was no problem with loose threads. The pillow case washed up beautifully. I just threw it in with some towels and didn't take any special care.

"First, I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my fair and honest review.
The bracket was heavier than I expected, and larger.  The wall mount plate was much wider than I had expected. I had a swing arm mount previously and the mount was a single, stud-width plate. It was not designed to hold really large televisions, so it could get by with that. This one is wider with 6 mounting holes, one row of which I was able to mount in a stud. The other column of holes were set into a hollow wall and should server my purpose fine--which is to hold a 32"" LED tv that weighs next to nothing.
Mounting: my first issue was finding my stud in the wall. Once that was found, I was able to securely attach the mount. The instructions with the mount leave much to be desired. My interpretation of the drawings was to attach the mount to the back of the tv and then try to bolt it to the wall mount. This proved to be impossible for us. I then removed the plate from the back of the tv and attached it to the arm. I then had to have my wife assist and install the screws into the back of the tv as I held it in place. (this tv was mounted high on the wall, making it more difficult to attach.) Once attached, I found I could not level the tv properly. It appears that the mounting plate that attaches to the television has a tapered center bracket and the top part was slightly narrower than the bottom, which allows rocking side to side of the tv. After all the effort it took to get this on the wall, I did not want to remove it to turn it over or to accurately measure, so this could be correctable or could just be my imagination. My television also has all of the HDMI cables connect in on the left side and that helps pull that corner lower. So far, the angle has not really caused me issues so I am not inclined to remount the system.

The kit comes with multiple sets of bolts for the back of the tv and 6 lag screws and hollow wall anchors. That, in itself, is impressive as I did not need to go purchase any additional hardware. The mount seems to be very heavy duty and I expect a long life from it. I loosened one of the pivots and have not fully tightened it again so it is not holding the pivot angles securely, but that is something I did and will need to correct.

Overall, I think there are mounts that may be easier to attach and remove the tv, but this one will serve the purpose and the price was right. I rated this 4 stars because of the difficulty of attaching the tv and the lack of clear instructions.",1

"Easily to apply and fits like a glove. The installation with this wet technique is super easy and is very forgiving. After aligning it properly I noticed that the cut outs are perfectly designed for this phone and I didn't need a 2nd try to get it to work.

I have had issues in the past getting cases to not peel up the edges but will wait the 12 to 24 hours toilet the protector dry completely before trying. The fit of this protector is perfect as it covers the entire glass front of the phone with no gaps or extra going over the edge. The matte screen I haven't been able to test the glare protection as the sun hasn't been out on over a week here. I do notice a slight ""sparkle"" in the protector but that is normal for matte applications. I did receive this product for free/discounted price for my honest review.

I would recommend this to anyone in need of a quality screen protector and one that needs the matte finish if they will be using this often in the sun. With how easy it is to install and the horrible quality of tempered glass protectors for the Galaxy S7 this is the product to go with. I received this for free in exchange for my review.",1

Taking it out of the Amazon packaging, I was immediately impressed by the design and build quality of this long travel umbrella.

The stem appears strong and is hexagonal in shape to aid stability, and the spokes appear well designed and made to withstand the elements.

The  fabric appears soft but strong, and the handle is also soft and quick release button is a very quick. This is a nice huge umbrella. It covers everything and protects you from getting wet.

I also liked the fact this comes with a wide strap with a large velcro fixer at the end to keep it closed when not being used. The spring action to both open and close this is precise and effective. It has a dome shape to it instead of a flat taper edge type umbrella. It's really nice because with the overhand from the umbrella shape it really keeps the rain from getting your bottom half wet. It's also a really nice color blue, though a bit darker than the one shown in the picture
Overall, Id have absolutely no problems in recommending it. In fact, at this price, this is best.

Highly Recommended.

"I've had a fountain for years, but the pump appeared to be dying. I easily replaced it with this one. I think it might even be a bit more powerful than the original one. The adjustability of the pump was a nice addition. In a sink filled with water, I was able to see the various levels of water flowing based on the dial. It was easy to remove the old pump and place this one in. There are two extra fittings that would be useful for various connections. I didn't need either in my case, but glad they are there if I use this pump in a different fountain or setup. I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",1

"I often depend on others leaving honest reviews when I need to order a new item. I find that one of the most difficult things about ordering online is that I cant hold or touch the products before buying them. So, I love reviews from others who have touched, inspected, and used the item Im thinking about purchasing. I strive for the same in leaving reviews for others  to leave a review that will help others make an informed decision (never to inflate the product's quality). I received this item at a discount or gratis from the manufacturer or a seller to objectively test and review it, but received no payment and have no obligation to offer anything other than my real opinion based on my experience. Amazon's ""Verified Purchase"" indicator shows that this review matches an actual product ordered and delivered from Amazon. If you have found this review helpful, Id love if youd indicate that below.
I received this product at a significant discount for my honest review and they are my own opinions and of my own accord. I received no monetary gain for this review and I am not required to give a positive review. I do not know the seller or am associated with the seller in any way. When I rate something the number of stars is just my opinion on how I feel about the product. If I give something a 5 star rating that means that I truly love that product and use it often it and I truly am glad I have it. Items I give 4 star ratings are items that do exactly as I would expect, but have not stood out significantly in any way or that have some minor flaw but the product is worth it to overlook the flaw. An item that gets a 3 star rating from me is one that I feel neutral regarding the product. Rarely will I give a 1 or 2 star rating unless the item is completely worthless and not worth the money. If I have received the item at a discount, then I go through the same exact reviewing process as if I paid full price for the product.

First, this product is made in the USA which is a rarity that i believe we should support. The installation kit includes the screen protector, spray , rubber smoother, screen cleaning cloth and a link to an install video which made installing this a breeze. After i finished the install and used my phone i instantly noticed the difference in feel and loved it. It feels more malleable then bare glass and also more protected. In the event that something does try to scratch my phone and the screen protector rips, IQ shield provides a lifetime warranty to replace it at not cost. All of this for less than eight bucks. Cant find a better deal anywhere.",1
"GL-Sail(TM) Premium Gel Color Pen for Arts & Crafts, Adult and Children Coloring Books, Scrapbooks(Pack of 12)

I work with people that are struggling on some level, most frequently with anxiety but also with anger or grief or depression. We typically end our sessions together by journaling what weve processed. The last thing I want to do when Ive helped someone get to that point in the session is to trigger frustration so when I offer my clients pens to write their thoughts with, Im careful to make sure that those pens are reliable, easy to use, and smooth  I don't want anything interrupting their closing activity. Using the GL-Sail Gel Color Pens lets me be certain that my clients have access to writing instruments that will enhance this activity and that will inspire them to be creative and thorough.

The GL-Sail gel pens arrived tidily encased in a clear plastic organizer. Each pen seats securely in a slot in the holder and the size, at 6 by 3 by 1.5 is perfect for handily storing or transporting the collection. The case lays open flat and each of the brilliant colors is displayed to prompt creativity. The colors range from a deep matte black to a gentle aqua blue.

I received the GL-Sail gel pens at a discounted cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the smooth consistent performance of these great writing pens!",1
"I had an older style floating fill valve which kept leaking the ball kept falling off and I just kept having issues with it. The PlumbCraft Water Saving fill valve is a blessing. Easy to swap out and install anyone could do it,and right away you notice the difference fills fast like its suppose to works great. Now I've only had it about 2 months but so far its working perfectly. I may buy 2 more for my other toilets in the house and save on my waterbill.

"I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review.

This stick is great!  I've had this brand on my wish list for a while now and so glad I picked it. The aluminum tubing is very sturdy with both the cell phone holder and the GoPro mount as well as the ""stick"" itself. It locks and unlocks easily to what ever length you want (up to 36"").  Ok i'll admit I did use it to take a selfie and it works great! Even the case to carry it in is super nice for a selfie stick.  If you're on the fence about one of these I highly recommend this one, it's sturdy construction and great mounts should last you a while!",1
"I bought this bowl as a gift for my sister, who is very active with her boyfriend (hiking, camping, etc) and brings her dog along whenever possible. It's convenient to carry, thanks to the collapsible design which makes it fit into backpacks easier, and simply clipping it to a belt loop or backpack makes it even easier to save space while moving (as long as you don't mind it swinging against you with every step). The bowl is easy to wipe clean and dries quickly. It's come in handy for us; the only potential drawback is that it might be a bit small for a larger-sized dog who needs a little more space to ""lap up"" the water, or might knock it over if they have a long snout. For my sister's medium-sized terrier mix, this works fine for what we need it to do. She (the dog) seems much more comfortable drinking out of the travel bowl than the previous method of pouring water out of a water bottle while she lapped at it in mid-air (which we tried for short walks when it's hot outside). Everyone's happy; no complaints!

"I'm always on the look out for insulated water bottles.  My son plays sports and honestly we can never have too many!  I received the package (on time and in great condition), took out the bottle, washed it and left it on the counter to dry.  Next thing I know, my son is asking Who does this bottle belong too?  Its cool!  Can I use it?.  He was excited when I told him that I got it for him.  So, off the son and the bottle went to a day at work and then an evening of practice.  When he got back I asked about the water bottle and his response was I LOVE IT.  Ice stayed in it all day and into practice all I had to do was keep filling it up with water.  Needless to say, the water bottle went off to work and practice the next day and the next day.

This insulated bottle is a nice large size so he doesnt run out of water half way through practice.  I purchased the black and I like the matte finish (as does he).  My son has not used the bonus cap (with a flip up nozzle and straw) and just unscrews the lid and drinks straight out of it.  He wants another one.  What else is there to say?

"Ipad Mini Case, OLG Tech Design - Case is good. Its for one of my children. Picked it because it has the hard and soft with a built in screen protector. Screen protector doesnt sit right on the tablet. You can feel the separation from the screen. But it will work for my kids. I could see this only lasting a year unless I catch my kids picking at it. We have had case similar to it and the covers for the openings usually don't last long. Either way it should help protect the kids iPad mini from accidental drops or falls, as well as keep the screen protected from scratches

I ordered it to compare to other fitness bands I already own (as shown in my pictures and videos). I saw a lot of mixed reviews and wanted to show my findings.
THE APP SETUP:
For one, I wanted to mention the adding the Veryfit 2.0 app was VERY easy and fast to set up. When I received the watch, I downloaded the app while I was charging the watch and was able to set up the Bluetooth connection shortly after.
COMPARISON TO OTHER FITNESS WATCHES AND BANDS:
I also compared the steps, heart rate, and sleep tracking for all three watches and found that they are all very similar (check pictures). This watch does the same things that other smart watches does, but at a MUCH more affordable price! I will note that the only feature for fitness on the watch is a ""run"" feature that tracks steps, heart rate, and distance in a time span of your choice. It will not let you choose what you are doing, however (such as elliptical, or treadmill, etc.)
STEP TRACKING ACCURACY:
After wearing this watch a full 12 hour day along with two other fitness bands, my findings were that the ID107 Veryfit 2.0 smart watch was within 900 steps of my other two watches. Considering I had two watches on one hand and 1 watch on the other, I expected a bit of a difference. I was impressed to find that out of over 12,000 steps that all of the fitness bands were within that range. Also, someone mentioned that this watch won't track steps that are walked in place, like on a treadmill, but I tested it myself and it does! As long as you move your arm while you take your steps, it will track them!
HEART RATE / BPM ACCURACY:
What I did note is that the heart rate monitor is very accurate if the band is adjusted to your arm snugly enough for it to check correctly. If you are having an issue with the BPM number, you probably don't have it on tight enough. The heart rate was within 0-10 BPMs of my other watches and fitness machines I was using. Note: It checks your heart rate every 10 minutes or so throughout the entire day. This is on par with the Microsoft Band 2.
SLEEP TRACKING:
This fitness band does something extra that many other fitness bands doesn't do. It gives you your sleep quality! -- Which includes your deep sleep compared to just light sleep. This helps if you want to know how much REM sleep you got on any particular night, which is really important if you're working out and trying to lose weight, like me!
CONCLUSION:
There are MANY fitness watches on the market right now. Some being insanely high priced because of their brand, while some are much less known and are more affordable. This smart band has a very easy interface and an app that is very intuitive to use. I would recommend this fitness band to anyone looking to start working on being a healthier person and going on more walks or runs. It will do everything you need ACCURATELY at a much more affordable price! I received this product for free in exchange for a detailed and unbiased review. I very much enjoy testing varieties of fitness bands and have tried 6 so far! I wanted to show anyone reading this what they can expect from this product! :)",1
"Cool colorful ocean waves projection lamp! Easy to set up. Portable. Very soothing and relaxing visual stimulation.  It's a surprising that this small lamp produces so many colors with its bright LEDs that light up my ceiling. I like laying down on my bed and relax will watching the colors dance above me, a natural mood enhancer in the comfort of my own room. Lightweight and portable design so I can take this colorful projection lamp with me wherever I go. Great to use by itself or while listening to music. Auto shut off is a convenient feature if I fall asleep.

Also great for a unique lighting effect for parties. Bright LED color waves look so cool at night. Will definitely be a source for conversation. Has many different lighting modes to choose from. This projection lamp changes any environment.  I am pleased with this product.

"The band width is perfect. At certain points the ring feels a little sharp, but nothing will cut you. The part next to the finger is nicely rounded.

"I bought this to use in the computer closet.  I'm impressed by the quality of the build.  I really like that the outlets are spaced far apart so there is no problem plugging multiple large transformers.  I guess some of the other reviews are correct that the logo is upside down, but for my uses it doesn't really matter.",0
"I love the look but this case didn't last two full months. Within 3 weeks, cracks had started to form at every opening in the side of the case (volume, power, speaker, headphone jack). In another two weeks, the soft lining had completely separated from the hard case in two places. I have never destroyed a phone case so I have a difficult time believing I was so hard on this one that it was falling apart in two months.
Maybe mine was a fluke. I'd like to believe so. I've never had trouble with speck cases before.",0

"Very sturdy build.  Handle on top makes grinding peppers very easy.  Use a funnel to get peppercorns in.  Makes a slight squeaky noise when grinding, but I am not sure that it is because it is brand new. Pepper mill is top heavy because of the handle...I just need to find a container to hold it upright...currently have it in my drawer next to range.  My husband wants me to order another one to be the salt grinder.  I purchased this item at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.",1
"This camera is great!  I don't even know where to start...  I purchased this to add on to my existing 3 cameras from another company and an NVR from that same other company.  The model I ordered and received was the bullet camera without microsd.

The camera itself is well-built and sturdy.  It appears to be made of solid aluminum, which is great!  My cameras made by a different company were made of plastic.  The adjustment screws on this camera are much easier to use than my other brand because they have allen heads.  The other brand had phillips head screws that made tightening them down tight enough to hold the camera steady was dificult.  Another thing I like about these, is the sun visor is part of the camera body.  On the others, its adjustable and removable, but I cant figure out when it would be a bad idea to have it on there.  The connections on mine were a reset button, a power plug, and a female RJ-45 ethernet plug.  The plug in the amazon pictures is not the type that was on my camera.  The type on my camera was the round type and was the same as the ones on my other brand cameras.  They include an o-ring and a rubber bushing that slide inside a plastic cover that screws on over the rj-45 jack.  It sounds confusing, but once you see it, it all makes sense and is perfect for keeping water out of the connection if they're mounted outdoors, like mine.

As for the video quality and networking side of things, that was great too.  The camera was immediately recognized once plugged in to my PoE NVR.  I was able to simply plug in the username and password settings found in the manual and the camera popped right up on my screen.  I am able to access many of the same functions from my NVR interface as my other brand cameras.  The video wquality showed to be what the camera's stated resolution was along with many other resolutions I could pick.

All-in-all, I am very happy with this Reolink camera.  I would definitely purchase this camera or another style of their PoE cameras if I decide I need more in the future.

I miss the tea kettle that this new model tries to replace. That goofy pull tab is next to a hot and sharp piece of thin metal. The plastic cover over the spout started to melt by the 2nd day of use. It does boil water and looks nice for now but it doesn't compare to the old style that we used to have. Does anybody make the old dependable type we all used to have?,0
"I generally buy Stella and Chewy's raw diet at my local pet food store.  However, for an unplanned road trip where I would be taking my dogs, I decided to purchase the freeze dried food at my local store on the advice of the owner.  Once at my destination I realized three days before my trip was to end that I would need more food.  Hurray amazon to the rescue!!! Great, I was very happy when the food arrived on time as promised.  My dogs appreciated it even more because they had their Stella and Chewy's. However, after I opened the bag I was very disappointed to learn that the food that was delivered to me on June 27, 2016 had an expiration date of May 2016. So it appears I am stuck with food that has expired. What did I notice about the out of date food? It didn't rehydrate the same as the food I've purchased within its expiration date.  I was hoping that this would be a good answer to getting the freeze-dried food but I am not certain I wouldn't have a similar experience if I ordered again.  This is one of the very few times that I have been dissatisfied with order through amazon. Very disappointed.",0
"I knew I needed this product when I found myself using my thumb at the end of the hose to spray thingswhich usually just results in me being a soaking wet mess every time I turn on the hose. When I received this product I was very pleased with it! It looked, and worked, exactly as promised! I didn't have any water leaking all over me, it was comfortable to hold, and very versatile. I love all of the different spray options. I have found this very useful when I am washing my truck. I like to use the varying modes depending on which part I am spraying. For example I go with a much heavier spray on my tires than the rest of it. The nozzle also works great for watering both small plants and large lawns. In addition, I am also able to rinse my dog off with it. There are more gentle modes, so I am able to rinse him off before he heads in the house after playing outside. He really loves to roll around in the mud, so it seems like every time I take him outside, he is trying to bring all of nature back into my home! Lastly, I have really just found it useful for odds and ends sort of jobs. It really is versatile, so I don't feel like it is as limiting as other garden hose nozzles. Overall I was extremely satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone else who is in need of one. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.",1
"I've tried a number of different Bluetooth transmitters and this is by far the most solid one I've found.  It looks feels like a great solid build as well.  I use it primarily with my iPhone for my hour-long drive to work.  It's very easy to connect and control from either the remote or the device itself.  Much to my surprise, the remote actually works great with this one too.  My experience with others has been that you pretty much had t to touch the remote to the device to work, but not with this one.  The display is great and all the options for sources work flawlessly.  You can use up to 16gb SD/MicroSD (with adapter) and/or 16gb USB flash drive and a Bluetooth device.  The clarity seems to be true stereo since it splits the sounds up great.  The other important thing for me was it doesn't take the bass out and downgrade the quality of the music like others I've tried and the radio signal strength is far superior for no interference in my enjoyment of my music.  All in all I would highly recommend this for anyone since I have gone through roughly 6 others and the price is very reasonable.  Lastly, their directions far surpasses that of competing brands I've used.",0
"This ping pong paddle is pretty rad!
It fits my hand comfortably. The ping pong paddle is lightweight and easy to hold, especially for those with little arm strength. The handle did seem just a little short for my husband.
The design is simple.
The rubber on the paddle is smooth and does well at hitting the ball. The sound when hitting the ping pong ball is a little hollow.

This flashlight is very well crafted, does not have a cheap feel to it like so many out there.
having the option with different Batteries is nice.

Three Modes and Zoom all work as advertised.
Not sure about the Lumens, since I have no way to measure it. It is definitely bright.

"What a clever, and EASY, way to finally cut up a watermelon without getting any of the bitter rind, but also, not leaving any of the yummy red part!
I finally got the opportunity to try out my slicer last night, to prepare our watermelon for desert.
It not only sliced right through the pulp of the melon smoothly and easily, but it made removing the pulp easy as well. I have arthritis in both of my hands, and this was WAY easier than trying to cut the melon into slices with the rind.

The item arrived packaged REALLY well. Like, almost TOO well, lol. However, it DID arrive safe and sound. It washes very easily, dries quickly, and doesn't actually take up TOO much room in my kitchen tool drawer.

I truly like the handles.  It provides a great grip, and makes it very comfortable to use.

"PROS  The pillow overall is a nice balance between soft and firm for memory foam. It is soft to touch but has the firmness needed to cradle your head firmly at night. It stay cool enough at night that I am not waking up as often due to the recent heat waves we have been experiencing here in Southern California. It was a pleasantly surprise to find that removable and washable covers that were included with the pillows.

"I love this shirt. First, the fabric feels silky (like polyester) so it drapes nicely. The plunge is a bit too low (I don't want to shock people with too much cleavage!) but I have no issue wearing a sports bra or camisole under neath it. I love this because once I tighten the strings, it enhances what God blessed me with, while skimming over my tummy area. It's very flattering. I am a plus sized girl; I wear an 18X and ordered this in the 18. It fits perfectly. The hemline, in a shirttail style, comes down to just above my knee (I am 5' 1"") in front, so I can wear more form fitting shorts with this and my tummy won't show. From a side view, all attention is drawn to my bust line, and I am just fine with that. I am seriously considering getting more colors - I like it that much!",0
This suit is great on the model but in real life the bottoms don't come up nearly as far and the top doesn't come down as far.  The sides of the suit are rouched but the front isn't which isn't super flattering.  I'll be returning it.,0
"These are ok but not quite the fit I would like. I love the matte gold color of the front part of the shoes. The back of the shoes are a very shiny gold. I took photos of both to show the details. The reason I gave it four stars is the fit. I'm usually a 7.5 so I ordered an 8. They are the right width but the are a bit tight zipping up the back. However if you look at the photos my toes seem very far from the front of the shoe. The straps of gold across the feet are also hard and I'm concerned about blisters from the shoes. I will update the review once I wear them around.

"One of the first things that I realized is how well it is made. The handles are reinforced by a large stitched sections below the handles. They go far enough down and cover a good amount of the bag. My fiance literally had my 8 year old sit in it and he lifted the bag by the handles. The seams held wonderfully. I filled it with garden soil and already soaked it with water and any excess water came out through the bottom and sides easily. This will be perfect for our potatoes this year.

"These Boho Floral Style Criss Cross Headbands are AWESOME! I purchased this for myself because I wear headbands frequently. I own one headband that is very similar to these headbands and it is actually my favorite headband I own. I love it so much because of the ""criss cross"" knot style that these headbands also have. I have very thin hair so when I wear headbands, my hair looks very flat and it is hard to get volume at the top of the headband even with teasing. This ""criss cross"" knot style somehow gives the appearance that your hair has volume because the knot piece kind of sticks up (in a good way) and doesn't just lay tight and flat across your head. I immediately tried these headbands on when I received them (which did take a while to ship), and they fit perfectly! They are not too big or too tight. They are perfect. I have a normal sized head and they do not fall or move while wearing them. The colors of these headbands are also perfect for summer! You can ultimately wear them with any outfit and they will match great since they have so much pattern to it. I can't wait to wear them and bring them on my upcoming vacation!

Keyboard works perfectly. I'm typing this review on it now. I'm used to typing on a macbook pro keyboard and haven't had any real challenges with this one. It's a decent covern and stand for the iPad and requires no charging which is nice. The only complaint I really have about it is that it's loud. Fortunately I usually only use this at home but if I was in a meeting or in a class trying to take notes it could be distracting to others.,0
Excellent product. Thanks,0
I ordered the light pink and gold case. I absolutely love the colors together and have already gotten tons of compliments on the phone case alone. Its outer layer of material isn't smooth..its slightly rough...but in a good you can maintain your grip kind of way. The golden peice clicks into place and stays on tightly and firmly. Now the different colored trim snaps on and off easily bit offers no other form of protection to the phone. Its just fun and colorful and offsets the case color. The buttons are placed perfectly and fit the phone snug and just right. The charging port on the phone does not get interrupted by the case at all. The signal and reception still maintains its highest strengths with the phone case on. All in all I'm happy with this phone case. I love it and its just my style. I received this product at a discounted price for my unbiased review and I sure am glad I did. Thank you!,1

"Best. Hose. Ever.

I ordered this hose for my father in law, he has been wanting one forever. He was looking at the cheap ones at the store, like you see on tv. I happened to come across this one and decided to order it for him as a surprise.

He is so happy with it! He said it is so much better quality than the ones he was looking at. I got him a 75 foot which he said is plenty long. The beauty of these hoses is the compact size. The 75 foot hose fits in a small bag when not in use. You need to make sure to drain it of course after you use it so you can store it but in my experiences with my own hose from the same company it drain easily. I love how long the hose get versus how much it shrinks when done. It doesn't get tiny, I mean it is still a long hose, but it definitely gets shorter and is easy to manage.

There is a valve on one of the ends so you can either close off your hose or open it, which in my opinion is the handiest thing ever. Also the metal ends seem very small but they fit very snugly on the faucet and do not leak at all.

The only down side is the hose being fabric gets wet and you need to let it dry out but that's any fabric hose, not just this particular brand.

I was able to purchase this product for a discounted price or free in exchange for an honest review. I would recommend this hose to everyone, I love it so much.",1
"I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for a review. I found the leash to be well-made. It is sturdy and has a double rivet on the snaps that attach to the collars. There is only one rivet where the two leads fits onto the one ""O"" ring, and having two would make it more secure if one is using it with larger dogs. The leash coupler, due to its size and weight, is probably best suited to larger small and medium size dogs. The snaps that attach to the dogs' collars are sturdy, but they were difficult to open and close, so keep some WD--40 handy! The pink color and the (well-attached) ""bling"" probably make the leash most appropriate for female dogs, as I can't quite imagine two male rotties in pink! It works well, and is definitely an improvement over the homemade system that we had been using.",1
I love Victoria K shoes. They are so cute and stylish. This pair in particular fits abit small. I even bought half a size bigger. I think its the elastic and the ankle band. seems too tight to me and it scoots my foot to far up in the shoe. My toes almost hang over the shoes. I haven't worn them once because im not comfortable wearing them because of the toes. Brand is great and shipped very fast.,0
Looks pretty. Very nice,0
"It was great when I first plugged it in but now, a few weeks later, it is running about 6 minutes fast and getting worse.",0
"True to size. Beautiful sandals!!! Great quality! Very comfortable. Like other reviewers said, if your toes are too big, they might slip out of the shoe. Luckily, not my case!!! Got them in two colors!",0
"This product fit well, however I believe the Nylon makes it a bit itchy feeling. This product would be better if it was cotton and spandex instead. I haven't been able to wear a pair all day because I find the fabric a bit irritating.  Please take this with a grain of salt as everyone's skin is different.",0
"I am beyond impressed with this lightweight backpack! When folded the backpack measures about 7x9 inches which makes it easy to carry and take on the go. I love that on the outside of the compressed backpack there is a white outline of a hiking backpack, just in case you forget what's inside (see pics). The lightweight material is very sturdy and water resistant, perfect for travel or any outdoor activities.

Here are some of the things I like:
1. Light-weight makes it easy to pack and store
2. Love the bright red color, helps to stay visible while outdoors
3. Backpack straps help distribute weight while on
4. Multiple compartments, two water pockets on both sides, one book/laptop pocket inside and one larger pocket on the outside and two pockets with zippers
5. Easy to clean due to thin material
6. Backpack straps are cushioned for additional comfort
7. Durable material and strong stitching supports even heavier items
8. Looks great on and fulfills my love for lively colors :)

I have taken my Kalusi portable backpack on multiple trips and it has never been a disappointment! This is a perfect gadget for any traveler and anyone who loves the outdoors. I even bought an additional one to keep in my trunk just in case of emergencies.

The backpack is very portable and handy. I am very satisfied with my purchase and thankful for the sample I received for an impartial review. I take it on every trip and it has turned into my new favorite travel must-have.",1
"The hood and head hole are a little 'snug' even though I don't have a huge head but once through it is not restrictive around the neck.

The material seems strong and it is waterproof. The eyelets on each corner are sturdy and don't seem like they would rip through if used to construct a shelter.

The only other tiny problem I have is that the press stud fastenings down the side can sometimes pop apart a little easily. Depends how active you are going to be whilst wearing it I guess.",0

Acadia sent me a sample to try and review, good or bad, but I haven't been able to find anything at all bad about this headset. The music is fantastic, with excellent highs, perfect lows, overall great presence, no matter what type of music you like. I played everything from classical to dixieland jazz, from country and western to hard rock, and it all came through beautifully.

What about phone calls? The phone calls were perfect. I could hear the distant party clearly, and they could hear me clearly. That means the microphone is doing its job and has a loud enough signal to make two way conversations good for both parties. My testing partners gave me high marks for the quality of sound from this headset on our phone calls. And that's saying something, because I have some picky distant parties.

So overall, I give this headset a big thumbs up.",1
"This USB-C Battery is the size of my Samsung Edge S7.  The casing have a premium feel to it.  The unit will only get slightly warm when charging.  The thing I like the most about this battery is the fact that you can charge it while it's also charging your cell phone or Macbook 12 which is what I'm using it mostly for. The Macbook 12 battery is almost 5300mah but due to higher voltage requirements it's not a direct like for like when comparing mAh like you can do with portable battery and cell phone.  The 10,000mAh battery won't charge your Macbook 12 twice.  You won't even have enough for 1 full charge.  You will get about 60% charge from Empty with this battery for the Macbook 12 when powered off.  When the laptop is powered on, the battery will barely maintain the charge for your Macbook 12 depending on how heavy your usage is.  This battery can do 3A via USB C to USB C cable and up to 2.4A via USB A to USB C.  The higher the amperage, the quicker the charging time.  I've received this via promotional discount for my unbiased review.

P.S I've seen some reviews where it's stated that the USB battery would draw battery from the Macbook 12 instead of charging it.  You won't have this issues via USB A from the battery to USB C to the Macbook 12.",1
"Perfect for the outdoors! These chairs are way better from the old school lawn or pool chairs, they're both upright and lounge chair combined that provide the ultimate versatility.  Just picture an outdoor recliner and this is what you have with the comfort of zero gravity.  Another good thing about the chairs are the fact that they come with tray tables that fit on the chair sitting upright or flat that I thought was a pretty nifty idea.  The construction of the chairs are very durable and appear to be well made with quality materials.  Storage is another great thing about these chairs as they fold up quite compact and fit nicely in small space given the fact they extend out as lounge chairs.  I give this product 5 stars for its design, build, and functionality.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review.  I recommend these chairs to anyone who has a patio, deck, lawn, pool, or plan on going to the beach or lake.  One would definitely love the comfort and convenience these chairs provide!",1

"I recieved this Silicone Wedding Ring for free in exchange for my honest review. I ordered the size 8 which is the smallest size it comes in. My husband has very skinny fingers for a guy he wears a size 7 ring normally. This ring even though it is a size 8, it was a nice fit for him. The material has some stretch to it so if you wear a half size or quarter size etc. It would still fit. It looks very nice on his hand. Unless you actually feel it you can't tell that it is made up of silicone. I love the silver stripe down the center its very masculine. It looks like it will hold up well with all the hard work my husband does. this ring also included a one year warranty which I was able to sign up for using the provided website.",1

I love the product for its adjustability. Tall, short, skinny, or chubby, the jump rope will fit all. I just place the metal knob where I want it and tighten.

Dont let that fool you though, because this jump rope is better than just your regular old one.",1
"This dress is getting 5 stars because it is absolutely perfect and the workmanship and quality exceeded my expectations.

 I picked the red dress with some minor black piping around the bow at the waist and at the neckline which I absolutely love and adds a nice accent.

I am 5 foot 6 inches tall and 130 pounds. I usually wear a size 6 or 8 dress and I ordered a size large in this dress and it fits me perfect. I wear a 36 D bra size. The dress is 98% cotton and the rest is spandex. The spandex gives it that little bit of move when you feel like you've eaten too much and your dress needs to stretch out a little bit(lol)... this dress will do it.

 It's a nice A line frame dress with the square neck and the bow is placed to the left side of your waist. It appears that it can be used for a Retros or vintage dress in the way that is made.

It is form fitting all the way down to the waist and then has a small flare coming out from the waist. It reminds me of something that they would have worn in the thirties and forties. It's extremely comfortable and looks very nice and flattering on. It's cinches at the waist which gives a more flattering look. There are darts in the back to improve the fit of the top part of the dress. The top part of the dress is square in nature but does dip down a little bit around the chest which is absolutely beautiful and a very nice feature to this dress. It has a long zipper in the back to make it easy to get in and out.

I absolutely love this dress and the color. I would not recommend machine washing it but I would dry clean it or if you're been so lucky to obtain a steamer for clothes on Amazon I would recommend using that on it.....it would be perfect.

 The dress is a little bit below my knees and it looks fabulous with just a pair of nice simple black pumps. I wouldn't wear red with it because it might be a little too much but the black pumps really bring out the black piping that is around the bow and the neckline and the armpits.

 You can purchase a petticoat to wear under the dress to give it more volume if you would like that. I personally would not but I'm sure the younger kids may. This makes for a perfect birthday party dress, cocktail dress, bridesmaids dresses, a picnic or even a date with your husband. You can literally use this dress for something as simple as just going on a date with your husband all the way up to using it as a bridesmaid's dress. This is going to be a very multi-functional and versatile dress.

Disclaimer I was offered the dress at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review for which I have given",1

The fragrance is very strong straight out if the box. I actually appreciate that it's heavily fragranced but the lavender scent triggered a headache immediately!

"These shelves sure are cute! I decided to mount them on a large empty wall in my kitchen, and I have plans to fill them with lots of mini house plants and knick knacks to really fill out that wall and give it some much needed decoration. I may also paint the silver screw heads white, as the silver really stands out against the white of the shelves.

The shelves were easy to assemble and install, for the most part. Each shelf is comprised of four parts, and they quickly snap together like big puzzle pieces, and then its just a matter of attaching them to the wall. Anchors are inserted into the wall, and then screws are used to secure the shelves to the wall via the anchors. I would recommend getting a second person to help with this, as its much easier with two sets of eyes and hands to hold the shelf up, make sure its level (I also used an actual level for this, to be really sure), mark the spot on the wall where the anchors go, etc.

The only hiccup we had while putting them up was with the anchors; there were two different types of anchors, two sets of one kind and one set of the other. The odd set out seemed to be of an inferior quality, and one of the anchors bent to the point of uselessness while being inserted into the wall. I had to replace it with another one I luckily had on hand. So while they technically came with all the hardware needed, one of the anchors had to be replaced after the included one bent. Other than that, there have been no problems with the shelves, either during installation or afterward.

These McKay 51 piece sanding drums work really well for crafts. These fit all rotary tools. I ordered these to use with my dremel. This set includes 6  rubber drum mandrels that are reusable and 45 sanding bands. The sanding bands are 120 grit. These are easy to use and change. The bands sand evenly and they do not take chunks out. I use these sanding bands on my wood crafts. They do an excellent job and are easy to work with. I can sand the sharp 90 degree edges of my wood items and make them curved. The results look very nice. I received this item for free to try in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.,1
"What a fabulous and fun derby hat!  My daughters preschool had a crazy hat day party that I knew I was volunteering for so I needed an epic crazy hat stat and I'm pretty sure I won the mom-lympics.  The hat stayed in my hair for over two hours and I was complimented all day long on how fun it looked.  I got this in the fuchsia, hot pink color and it really is super bright and true to color on the images.  My daughter has since adopted my hat and wears it with her princess dresses, and it probably looks better on her than it ever did on me lol.  This hat would be super fun to wear to a wedding or another big gathering party like a set for a bachelorette party or something fun.  If you have a place to wear this to, wear it!

They been washed as many times as worn and they still look great. After washing they go right back to the starting size and fit just as well after washing. I think these are pretty good socks.

"Easy to learn to use and so much less waste!

At first, I was really unhappy with this. I felt like it wasn't saving me time or effort and gave up. Then I went back to using my knife and realized just how much less of a headache it really is!

The results aren't quite as pretty as they are on the box, but I get better and better at using it each time (my first try was a bit of a hackjob) so I'm sure I will end up there eventually.

The box it comes in is just SO cute and would make a wonderful gift for a fellow watermelon lover!

It also heavily reduces waste. It's difficult to get the last bits of the inside of a watermelon but this makes it incredibly easy to shave the edges inside and get every last bit.

Also, because you are able to slice and remove the pieces so cleanly, it leaves behind big pools of watermelon juice right in the rind instead of all over your cutting board, which you can pour out into a cup for a fresh glass of watermelon juice! Add some fresh mint, crushed ice, lime, and vodka for a tasty cocktail treat. I adore watermelon juice so this was very exciting for me not to wash all that goodness down the drain!!

The wire at the tip of the tool feels very sturdy to me and easily slices the melon.

The strawberry huller is absolutely adorable and works very well. I serve strawberries often during the summer and get so many compliments on it. The free huller makes this purchase worth it compared to competitors.

I give 4 stars because I think the handle could've used more padding to make it more comfortable to hold while slicing harder melons.

"The minimalist silicone wedding band is everything I was hoping for in an alternative band. It's thin, flexible and I loved the color. I just wish I had ordered the right size.

"This thing is awesome! It's very quiet and powerful enough to get your basic grass trimming done. It's got an easy handle that you can shorten or extend and with a twist you can convert the head to a pseudo-edger. It can handle weeds too but it can struggle with tough/thick weeds. The only downside to this is that a full battery charge only lasts about 40ish minutes. For most people that should be sufficient, but I have a large yard and that's sometimes not enough time to finish the job.",0

They look so small but the light they put out is very impressive.  They aren't glaring bright, but instead a very soft brightness if that makes sense.  The copper wire on the strand makes hanging them just about anywhere so easy. I have them hanging over my french doors at the patio.  I hung them with out having to add any nails or hooks to keep them from falling. They are literly sitting on top of the door frame and have stayed up there for several nights just by simply bending them at the corners of the door frame.

The solar panel is big enough to catch a good amount of sun, they come on as soon as it starts going dark and are off at dawn.  The solar panel comes with a stake that can be turned in any direction so the panel gets the best amount of sun.  There are 100 multi-colored lights on 33 feet of wire.  The lights are spaced just a little over 3 inches apart.  I have my strand doubled around my door so they appear closer in the photos.  I'm looking forward to having these at Christmas time, I won't have to worry about turning them off and on every day and night.

I will come back in a couple of months to update this review to reflect how well the lights are continue to perform.  I feel as though a true test of a product can't be done the first week, so I always test things for at least 3 months and then come to update.

  This case is very nice. I like the way it looks on my new iPhone SE. My new phone is really nice, so I wanted to get a great looking case for it. The gold trim highlights the Bronco Blue (Navy Blue) liner. Although there are many great colors to choose from, it's Bronco Blue for me. The fit is perfect. I am real happy with the look. The volume buttons and the ON button are cover by the liner and work perfectly. All the utility cutouts around the gold trim bracing are precise and look great. It fits like a glove!

"TERRIBLE...unless you love room temp or cold coffee. I received a free Contigo (holds 16oz) with my Kuerig and I LOVE it.

"I work very long days and need a lunch bag large enough to carry all three meals and snacks.  This is a large capacity bag and I was able to fit two containers, snacks, and a drink (shown in photos) into the bag with still being able to zip easily.

The inside is lined with aluminum to keep my lunch items cool through the day.  I had packed a drink and it was still cool five hours later when I took it out for lunch.  If you would prefer items to stay very cold, you might like to add an ice pack.  For me, cool enough to ensure the items were fresh was a sufficient level of cold and I did not add an ice pack to the bag.  When I packed the bag full, the zipper still operated easily and I had no issues with it not zipping or the zipper going off track.

The floral design is bright and beautiful.  It could be an ideal choice for a young girl who is tired of having character themed lunch bags and is ready for a change.  I seem similar floral patterns as a popular choice for lunch bags in the refrigerator at my work place.  I enjoy the bright, vibrant colors and the handles are ideal for carrying the lunch bag.

I love the large capacity and bright floral design of this lunch bag and look forward to many years of use of this durable bag.

"O M G  This is so SOFT!  No. Seriously.  You really need to know this.
Also a very COMFORTABLE fabric.  I didn't expect that when I ordered it.
This headcover has hidden built-in elastic in the back for a secure, comfortable fit.  If I am not mistaken, there also seems to be elastic/spandex in the material.  So not only does it fashionably gather in the back, but the fabric has a bit of give.  Plus there are two pieces you can choose to tie in the back for an even secure fit.  I imagine without hair, your scalp alone is a bit smaller than your head with hair.  The more secure and snug this can be on your head, the better.  Even then the makers say this is ""one size fits most"".  So no promises.
I love the simple design. It's an easy on, easy off, no fuss bandana.  You could dress it up as much or as little as you want to.  A sheer scarf perhaps?  A crafty friend suggested personalizing it with your own designs.  But mostly if you need to wear this, you want head protection and concealment.
So buy this.  You'll love it.  You can't go wrong.

"From using the case thus far, I am extremely pleased with its performance. First of all, I love that the case is slide on, which makes it easy to add or remove quickly. It is extremely comfortable to hold and fits in the hand well. The case is slightly thicker, due to the extra battery, but it is not cumbersome.

This case allows me to use my phone throughout the day, without the fear of it dying. If my phone battery gets low, I can simply turn on the case charging function, and get a fully charged phone, even when in remote areas. I no longer have to rely on wall or car chargers.

The charger also comes with a screen protector, screen cleaning cloth, and charging cable (which is a micro usb cable).

Through testing, the case did provide a fast charge and will be more than adequate for daily use.

I do wish that the case had false buttons, instead of holes in the case for button access. Sometimes, it is difficult to reach the buttons. However, this is still a great case, and I love not having to constantly carry a separate charger.

Overall, I really do like the case. It could be improved with false buttons, but for this price point, it easily deserves 5 stars!

The magnifying glass also has a bright LED light attached to it which allows for better viewing no matter the surrounding light conditions. The item is powered using three LR1130 batteries, and it comes with a nice leather case for storage.

I think this is a useful item for any inquisitive student to own.  My nephew loves using his microscope lens to look at different leaves and bugs from the outside. It can also be used to inspect old coins, antiques, or even jewelry! I am pleased with my order. My nephew enjoys his new gadget very much.

I was looking for some shoes for my daughter to just slip on and run out of the house and I wanted them to be closed toe shoes. They also need to be closed toe for school so I ordered the black shoes with the white soles. These shoes seem to be very comfortable. Usually the first thing my daughter does when she gets home is take off her shoes but she left these on. She is not the best reviewer because she just likes everything but I asked her and she said they were comfortable and she likes them. They appear to be well made. The soles look like they are attached well to the durable canvas so this mom is happy. I also think these will do just fine being thrown in the washer. I received these Little Boys Little Girls Big Big Boys Big Girls Kids Tie up Slip on Canvas Sneakers for Children at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.,1
"I am a big fan of TUDIA cases because they are always really good quality while being low key. I ordered the grey case for my gold galaxy s7. It looks great, feels good and performs like a good case should. The lip that goes over the edge of the screen is nice and thick. Placing your phone face down should be no problem. The seams made during the manufacturing process are obvious but also smoothed down for a nice feel in the hand.  I can't find anything to really complain about this case.  I thought for sure it would be slippery since it's an all matte case but I was happy to find that it provides great grip.  I really like this case.

I received this case for free for my unbiased and honest review.",1
"I am so disappointed.  These shoes are adorable.  They are well made and perfect for a rocky beach.  The only problem is the fit.  I wear a 9-91/2.  I ordered a size 9 and they are way to big and I need to return them.  Bummer.

"I recieved the Nianpu UV Ultra Violet 21 LED Flashlight Brightest UV Pee Finder Tool Detector Scorpion Pets Urine and Stains Detector with Mini Blacklight Aluminum Torch Light Lamp in a very timely manner. It was well packaged and undamaged. It was interesting to take this to my daughters house and check after her dogs and son. I Wil no longer sleep on her couch without disenfecting it. This product has been an eye opener to say the least I have not discovered any scorpions yet, though I still look.

"Great collar! Ordered pink, is true to color in photo. Sizing is good. Seemed sturdy, though my dog ate hers shortly after I got it (she's an escape artist and wiggled out of it) so I guess I'll be ordering a new one!",0
Awesome for the price,0
"These shoes are really nice.  They look good, I have a wide food and I had to order a size or 2 up than normal, knowing these would be constrictive. They fit nicely, and are really easy wear.  They take a while to 'break in' but are super comfortable.  They are really easy to scuff (as you can see from one of the pictures).  The colors are nice and as I wear the more, the material bends more to my feet (which is good).  Will for sure be wearing these this summer!

"I like the red color of this case and it fits great on my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone. I also like the card holder on the back. It will hold two cards which is great if there is a certain pair of cards you use a lot. Just slide the back over and the cards are revealed, making it super accessible.

"So far I'm really happy with these bluetooth earbuds. I usually hate earbuds. My ears are on the small side, and they usually get sore whenever I use earbuds. I had gotten these for my husband, but wanted to try them myself.... he doesn't even know they exist because I like them so much and I'm keeping them for myself! Lol They're really comfortable in my ears! The wrap around ear style is awesome for working out so they don't fall off. I haven't had them fall off at all yet. I even like to wear them around the house while I clean and do chores. My 2 year old looks at me like I'm nuts because I'm dancing like a maniac and he can't hear any music Hahaha!

The sound quality is pretty good. The bass though, is lacking for me. I like a little more bass to my music, but I think this would be too low for anyone. It's muffled and doesn't have that punch I'm looking for.

Overall I'm pretty happy, and I don't think I'm gonna give these up to my husband ;)

My thoughts and criteria for products I review: (Amazons Rating Criteria in Parentheses)
' 1 star (I hate it!): Feel it's a waste of money. Will never use it again. Would never recommend. Not safe to use. Either throw away or return it.
' '2 star (I don't like it): Don't like it and wouldn't use it again, but may still have at least 1 positive thing about it.
' ' ' 3 star (Its ok): Product has both positives and negatives, and I may or may not continue using it. Someone else may like it more and is potentially still worth purchasing.
' ' ' ' 4 star (I like it): Item as described in functionality, purpose and quality. May have 1 or 2 things I don't care for or would change, but not big issues. Would recommend if asked, but wouldn't say I love it.
' ' ' ' ' 5 star (I love it!): Practically perfect. Nothing lacking in functionality or quality. Love it and would not only recommend, but would purchase for others and continue to purchase for myself.

"Too small even for a 9 year old. It is not adjustable, and overall it looks and feels like a toy, not like a good release aid. The strap is terrible, the way of attaching the clamp to it is just unbelievably stupid (bent screw?!? Come on... ) No idea why there are so many positive reviews, possibly for many people this is the first release aid they have seen. This is not a serious product and if you are serious about the archery of your kid you should get a much better product.",0

"This is a good size laundry bag.  You sure can fit 2 or 3 loads of laundry easily.  It is a slick canvas material.  When flipped over clothes will just fall out as the material is slick and doesnt restrict movement of items inside.  You can definitely wipe down the bag if need be.  The bag has draw strings on the opening. The spring can be pulled for both sides.  There a large shoulder straps which extend from the top to the bottom of each size.  They can easily make it so you can carry the bag on your back if you so choose.  This is great for a dorm student or any apartment dweller. I got the blue bag and I must say it looks purple in my lighting. When I take pictures it looks blue.  If you have a strong aversion to purple I wouldnt recommend you get this as under certain lights it looks purple.  The bag is machine washable which is great if it gets dirty.  This bag is easy to store as it folds to a small size when not in use.  I am not an Amazon company affiliate. I am an Amazon Prime customer that enjoys writing reviews as a hobby.

"This bag has room for everything my husband needs to carry when he is on the road on business. When he travels, my husband sets up shop, literally, in a tent. He conducts business and takes charges and uses his tablet, and he needed something that he could use to carry the equipment he needs, along with his own personal items such as money, credit cards, his comb, and his keys. This bag has a multitude of zipper compartments and space to allow him to keep his business and personal items separate but still in the same container.

We both like the rugged design of this messenger bag. All of the seams are well sewn, and the zippers are secure and work smoothly. Each zipper has a little tab to help pull it open and closed. There is an adjustable shoulder strap and a small top strap to use as a handle. My husband can use this bag while wearing it for extra security. He is extremely satisfied with the rugged design of this messenger bag and is no longer worried that he'll be thought to be carrying a purse when he's out doing his job.

I received this product free from the manufacturer as a product test.  I knew immediately upon removing it from the package I was going to like it!  I love the soft and silky feel of the Jersey fabric even after washing it!  The protector fits perfectly the dimensions of my mattress without undue stretching.  The skirt pulls comfortably around all sides of the entire mattress and secures it in place beautifully.  This is definitely a better mattress protector than others I have purchased for twice the price.,1
It is nice quality however I wish it would come in 12 ft.  length.  It was delivered very quickly.,0
Case is difficult to confirm that it is installed.  The typical chargers wouldn't fit into the hole in the bottom of the case so you had to remove the case every time you needed to charge your phone.  One corner wasn't fully snapped in place and I destroyed my iPhone.  Switched over to a life proof case for my new phone and now much happier with it.,0
"I paid in full for this product and did not receive it as free or at discounted price.  Having that said, I was searching for a non-flimsy tray to carry seedlings and small plants outdoor daily from basement to the yard. This tray is high quality and not like the ones from the big box store.",1
"Ok so first I will talk a little about the package.. The 3 pack of Pleson HD Clear Galaxy S7 screen protectors came packaged in a nifty small rectangular gold sleeve with the Pleson logo on it. Upon opening the sleeve, I found the 3 HD Clear screen protectors, a squeegee smoothing card, an alcohol prep pad to clean off your screen prior to installation as well as dust removal tape. I would highly suggest using an application fluid for installing the screen protector. You can make your own application fluid by just using a drop of dishwashing soap and some water inside of a spray bottle.

I pretty much can never apply these kind of screen protectors properly. Generally I either wind up with a bunch of air bubbles or with the screen protector not lined up properly. But that was not the case this install The application fluid I made really made applying the screen protector properly extremely easy in comparison with all of the other screen protectors that I have tried without using any application fluid. I also did make sure that I cleaned the Galaxy S7s screen extremely methodically prior to the installation. The screen protector adhered to my Galaxy S7 with no air bubbles, lint, dust or particles stuck in between the Pleson HD Clear screen protector and my Galaxy S7.

Here are just a few of my screen protector install tips... Always make sure to do a thorough job while cleaning the phones screen prior to installing the screen protector. You can easily just use the supplied alcohol prep pad along with the dust removal tape in order to remove all of the nasty dust and fingerprints off of your Galaxy S7. Then just use a generous amount of your homemade application fluid when the screen protector is applied over the S7s touch screen display. By using the homemade application fluid, it will allow you to have the screen protector aligned entirely before the screen protector adheres to the screen. The screen protector will not completely adhere until the application fluid is removed and it is firmly pressed down upon.

This Pleson HD Clear screen protector definitely fits the Galaxy S7 very well. I like that the screen protector does not impede any of the S7 functions. With the screen protector applied, your Galaxy S7 will feel and respond exactly the same as it did without it. Please take mind that this screen protector is not made from tempered glass, but it is definitely better than going without any screen protection! This screen protection will definitely protect your screen against small scratches though.

My Final Verdict : I do have to say that this 3 pack of Pleson HD Clear screen protectors is a good deal if you are looking for an inexpensive way to protect your Galaxy S7 screen against minor scratches.

"Are you going to an outdoor event but don't want to bring a large, cumbersome cooler? Going camping and want to have the ability to wash your dishes without leaving the camp site? How about having a picnic for two and don't want to lug around a cooler? This handy collapsible bucket can handle all of that. It is foldable, comes with a storage bag and is lined so you can add ice or water to it. The handles are very sturdy so that you can carry it while it full of water. If it gets dirty on the outside it is easy to clean with just soap, water and a cloth.

My family is involved with Special Olympics. During the summer months when they practice outside we always like to have cool drinks available for all of the athletes. Unfortunately we don't always have the ability to carry around a big cooler. With this collapsible bucket we can have drinks on ice all during practice. It can hold quite a few drink bottles and ice, depending on the size of the bottles. When we are done with practice, we just dump out the melted ice and dry out the inside with a towel. It folds up easily into the travel bag and we are ready for the next practice. I wish I had enough to pass out to all of the athletes but that's for another day. :)

"Worked great for about 2-3 weeks, but then the neoprene material inside started bunching up towards the top the belt. There isn't a way to stretch it back down without cutting a hole in it to pull it down. Now there's being clumps on the inside of the belt which pretty much makes it useless. Very disappointing.",0

"I like this maxi dress a lot. The slit is a great touch, usually I hate going out anywhere that requires a lot of walking due to most of them getting caught up and mincing steps. This dress eliminates that issue and makes it easier to walk in. The material itself is also soft, comfortable and breaths well. I originally put the dress on and had my husband laugh at me. After he pointed out the reason I had to change my ensemble around a bit. Unfortunately I had on dark colored lingerie and it was on display to anyone that looked. It didn't look that way when getting dressed so make sure you take that into consideration. After changing into some nude panties and a bra I was on my way. Try to get no VPL undies if you can, if they have thick bands or lace detail you may be showing off more than you intended ;)

The flashlight feels great in the hand.  It feels very solid, cold, and has a great amount of weight to it.  The top comes with sharp angled grooves so you can break something such as a glass panel if in an emergency, which is a great touch.  Where the flashlight is held, the metal has rough texture etched into it, so it is much harder to loose grip. If the flashlight is dropped by mistake, a lanyard also comes attached, so the flashlight is much harder to loose.
The lens is very spherical in shape.  This is interesting and actually gives a level of coolness to it.  Although there are particles and very small scratches, I was able to unscrew the lens and take out the particles.  The small scratches don't make any noticeable difference in the spread or strength of the beam.
I then tested the battery life of this light.  With a 3000mAh 18650 battery, it lasted at near full power for about 2 hours, 30 minutes, which makes sense.
The disappointing aspect is that I then tested this light against the Duracell Durabeam Ultra 350, which outputs 350 lumens according to Duracell, a company I personally trust.  The maximum output is certainly not 1200 lumens.  At 1 inch from my hand, the Durabeam easily reflected off my hand and blinded me.  Then I tried this test with the Gracetop Tactical flashlight and it blinded me less so.  I continued to go back and forth with the flashlights, but with consistent results.
I must conclude that the Gracetop Tactical LED Flashlight Bright LED Flashlight with 1200 Lumens, Zoom Function and 5 Light Modes outputs less than 350 lumens.  I would guess around 300 lumens.
Still, this is a great flashlight.  Regardless, I know of similar merchants that offer near the same light with the same LED, but advertise a much more accurate lumen output.  For that I must knock off one star.
I give this product 4-stars.

"I have to say I have 5 dogs 3 large and 2 small, and out of five of my dogs the bigger dogs seem to like it more then the small dogs. The small dogs chewed on it for a short time and just lost interest. As you can see from the pic. my 3 large dogs they chew on it and cuddle with their new panda. I am thinking as they chew it must fill good on the gums.

I can see how this toy could also clean their teeth. My 130 pound dog loves this toy and dose not want to share with the others. He is so funny he treats this panda as if it were his baby he sleeps with it and if by chance one of the other dogs get it he whimpers at them and wants it back. First thing this morning he chewed a little while and then back to snuggling.

We have had this toy for two days now and the thing that was very important is that this toy has held up very well and my large dogs love it a lot. My dogs have been raised with small stuffed toys and have always been  so genital with everything they have had. In my opinion this is a great toy/ dental teaser.

"Bought this to keep in my day pack as we like to hike. I hope to never use it but it could make quite a difference in a pinch. The quality overall seems high for the price. Unless your an expert you won't be inspecting the contents as the average person (me) wouldn't be able to properly retie this ""grenade"". I'm taking it on faith that everything is in there and of a usable quality.
The grenade is tightly and securely bound and no loose ends to snag/catch while hiking. The weight is negligible. The knife could be of help in some limited situations, surely better than nothing. The cord appears to be fairly high quality and long enough to potentially help create a shelter if you pack a plastic sheet, space blanket, or something similar. By no means is this thing a complete survival kit, but it could prove a valuable asset.
All in all, I think I'd rather have this than not in a survival situation.

"These goggles are the best and easiest adjustable goggles that I have ever own!  I had to use my wife's old pink pair last week because I couldn't find my old ones so I bought these to replace my lost ones.  My wife's goggles were so difficult to adjust that I spent most of the time taking off the strap, making it tighter and putting back in the strap.  Needless to say I spent more time adjusting her old goggles than the time I spent in the pool! Once I got these, I needed to adjust them because they were a little big.  I just pulled on the side strap and it made it smaller while locking in the strap at the same time!  I plan to order another pair for my son!

"Car Mount Holder Vinous Air Vent Magnetic Car Mount Holder
This air vent car mount has very nice features like:  High Quality Material   Compatibility   Hands-free convenience   Lifetime Warranty and 100% Money Back Guarantee  The only draw back to the air vent car mount holder is that it blocks an air vent and living in South Louisiana you need every air vent you can get.

GREAT LOVE THE MINI FILM,0
"I often find I don't drink enough water throughout the day because water to me is bland and tastes like nothing.  This often leaves me dehydrated especially in these summer months when it's so hot out and I'm active outdoors.  I love gatorade and sports drinks but these have so many calories.  I came across this fruit infuser water bottle and I knew I had to order it right away.  I love this water bottle.  The water bottle is very durable and looks exactly like the picture in the advertisement.  The plastic is very heavy duty so I'm not afraid it will crack or break if it's on my backpack or tossed around.  It has a ring on the top so you can attach it to your bag.  At first I had a little trouble trying to open the water bottle but realized it was only because there is a lock position on the top and you just have to twist it to the ""unlock"" position, silly me.  The water comes out easily and the spout is plenty large so you don't have to suck hard to make the water come out (which I hate on some water bottles).  The only drawback for this water bottle is that the insert where you place the fruit doesn't go all the way down to the bottom so after you drink half of the water the rest of the water doesn't get the benefit of the flavor from the fruits you put in there.  There is also a small piece like a filter to keep seeds out which might get lost if you aren't careful.

UPDATE- I am updating this review from 4 stars to 5.  This is sturdier plastic and better lid design than other similar water bottles.  Despite the small basket inside I still recommend this above others.  The holes are finer so seeds won't fall through and I am very trusting of the locking mechanism on top and not afraid of spilling.",1

"Upon first opening this duvet cover, I was very surprised at how thin it was. I've never owned a duvet cover before, so I have nothing to compare to, but for some reason I pictured something thicker. BUT, after thinking about further, I am glad it is very light and airy, since the summer months are here, I don't want to be dying under the heat of a heavier one.

First, I ran them in the wash like I always do with new bedding. Well, unfortunately my washer decided to act up on my, and of course with a brand new WHITE duvet bedding and pillow shams. It ended up spewing chunks of dirt and sand all over, NO clue from what...but that is an issues I need to take up with my washer at another time. SO, anyways. I thought these things were going to be stained from the dirt and such because streaks of the dirt were all over it. So, after running all 3 pieces under a faucet to try and rinse out the scum, I was sooo surprised that it just simple rinsed away. The dirt marks came right off of the duvet and shams. Now I've never really dealt with washing microfiber, but this material just seemed to handle it like a champ. So now I have a brand new beautiful white duvet cover. I'm not saying they will never stain, but I am just so happy the dirt tracks didn't keep and I was able to literally rinse it off...it didn't have to go through a whole new wash in the washer...which I was afraid to use anyways at the time.

I like that the cover had buttons at the top with button holes, to keep the comforter/quilt inside safely. Again, my first duvet, so maybe that is standard...hehe.

The only part I did not like and it's my dryer's fault....was the fact that the directions state to Dry on a low heat and my setting for low heat were only available through the Express Dry which is only like 20 minutes, which I had to use several times, so then I ended up using a different setting at the end, and went up to a medium heat and they dried finally.

"This ring is beautiful to look at and comfortable to wear. It has a lovely design reminiscent of a ribbon or bow. The stars of this ring are the purple sapphires. They're a deep, clear royal purple, cut so that they give off a nice flash. The stones are accented with molding and rhinestones. The rhinestones are cut to sparkle nicely, too.

The shank is the perfect thickness; it's wide enough to feel substantial, but not so thick I feel it every time I open or close my hand. The fit is a comfortable one, altogether. The ring is just solidly made, overall. Despite all the detail it contains, it's smooth, and there's nothing to catch on my clothing or hair. I think this is just a lovely piece, overall.

"So, I do not ride a bike. My son does. This bike lock will be used for 2 reasons. Reason number 1, I will use this to secure my cargo on the back of my Dodge Durango. I have a trailer hitch cargo carrier and I put my coolers and containers on the back when we travel (items that will not matter if they get wet). I will run the cable through the handles and lock it to the carrier so that when we stop to eat or use the bathroom, I don't have to worry about someone taking something off the back of the carrier. When we get to wherever we are going, I will then unload the cargo carrier and lean it up against something (usually a tree) and will then wrap the cable around the tree and the cargo carrier and secure the carrier to the tree so no one can take that. Reason number 2, my son will use the cable and lock to secure his bike when he goes somewhere on it. I like the latch that attaches to the bike that will hold the coiled cable and lock to it while he is on his bike and the easy release button that will allow him to take it off and lock it up. And when we travel with his bike, it is easy enough and long enough to secure both the cargo carrier and the bike to the tree at the same time, killing two birds with one stone.

"There are many times when having a remote control for my iPhone camera is really needed, and this remote is absolutely perfect for my needs!  I can attach it to my keychain easily because of its big ring, and that way it's always handy and ready to use.

The remote came with one battery already installed as well as a spare battery.  The remote has an on/off switch on the side and a small light that indicates when it's on.  This is helpful so I don't inadvertently run the battery down.

I was able to easily pair the remote with my iPhone and it worked perfectly.  The bluetooth range is up to 30 feet so I can use it with my camera on a selfie stick or on a tripod.

I got the remote with the green accents.  The green is bright and eye catching.  I really like it!

"I was looking for a supplement for our dogs to assist with liver, joint, and bone health, all without animal products/ byproducts. This is the one! We have one dog with a liver that cannot handle too much protein or animal products, one with a thyroid issue, and one with sensitive joints. Also a semi-stray cat we adopted who was limping for months, but would not let us get close enough to take him to the vet.

This has aided in helping our dog's liver function, he is noticeably more active, energetic, and in a better mood. Same for our dog with a thyroid issue who can be very lethargic at times. My older girl is walking fine and is eager to run and play and wakes me up early now to do so! Also, eye discharge has cleared up! Shortly after giving to kitty, the limp began to dissipate to almost nothing!! We give our dogs a scoop twice daily with each meal, in conjunction with a mostly plant based diet and other vitamins. This seemed to be the magic ingredient though to see noticeable results in everyone's health! They also don't even seem to notice the powder in their bowls and eat like they normally do, no aversion whatsoever. I've already finished the first container and repurchased! :)",0
"Why, oh why did I not get more of these!  I received one free with another item and it was one of the BEST things I had on my trip!!  We tried to pack light for a 3 week trip to Italy and London.  I had packed several items in ziptop bags and squished the air out of them thinking that would help.  Well, not so much! They ended up taking up as much room as the stuff in the packing cube and since we had limited access to laundry the clothes in the bags were not as pleasant to wear after a day or so. I will be ordering more for my next exciting adventure and will never travel without them again!!",1

"These Crafty Croc Liquid Chalk markers are the greatest looking bright colors for making signs and decorations.  There are 6mm liquid chalk markers in 8 neon colors, 8 earthy tones plus black and white. They can be used on blackboards, whiteboards and windows and wash off easily (although always test first).  You can use it on paper. Each marker comes with 2 tips so you can switch around your writing style and font,  Once you get started, they are so much fun to use, you keep finding new things to decorate ( labels, signs, cards).  Be sure to shake well, remove the cap from your favorite color, prime the nib and color!  This is my first experience with this brand and I am already scoping out the next box of different colors and hues. The great thing about this product is that it comes with a money back guarantee.  You cannot beat that! Disclosure: I received this product for free, however this in no way influenced my review. I only write honest reviews.",1

"Very cute bathing suit and my 5 year old daughter LOVES it. I bought the XL (5-6) and it is a little short and the hat is definitely too tight.
We have to tie the one side tight so all of her is covered. She is a very slender girl and pretty tall, so a girl a little shorter it would probably fit better. My daughter does have a small head, so I wouldn't plan on the hat fitting. The bathing suit does fit her all around. If it weren't for my daughters extreme love for the swimsuit I probably would have returned it.

Tis review is for a EDUP Bluetooth Receiver. The product arrived in a timely manner. The package was no damaged or broken. I really like this product. I have always connecting and AUX cord to my phone to listen to music. This is a great new item I have been dying to have. I am jealous of everyone i know that has a new car with bluetooth sync! Now I have it too!! hehe... I would recommend this products for others to purchase but I do have one complaint... the device must be plugged into the cig outlet at all times! So I cant charger my phone. Please note that I did receive this product at a discounted rate. This is still my honest review of the product.,1

"This product arrived quickly and was packaged well. These are the absolute best laundry bags especially for washing bras with underwires. The larger bag I can fit two brawls in it. These are very durable and protect my bras extremely well.  Without these my bras would tear up tremendously in the washing machine and the underwire would eventually come out. They are made very well and I also like the fact that the zipper fold underneath so that it doesn't come unzipped during the wash cycle. They regular laundry bags with just messed material do not protect bras at all. I will definitely continue to god these in the future and recommend to my girlfriend and family.

"I've been using this as a diaper bag.  I can fit 4 diapers, a wipe case, a silicone bib and placemat, an extra set of clothes, toddler food pouches with ChooMee Sipn food pouch toppers for them and some snacks in the bag with room for more.  Our iPad also fits nicely in the spot for it.  The iPad spot is nicely padded without being bulky.  This bag is very easy to carry, along with carrying a 16 month old toddler around.

"We always need portable power banks.  I tried to charge with an existing micro usb cable that I had plugged into my computer but it wouldn't work.  It seemed to only charge with the cable it came with.  I couldn't figure why after 6 hours of charging via the computer why it would not charge from 91%.  It is handy to have and is very useful.  Came in a plain brown box.

Con:
The only one I see is that it would not charge with another cable except the one it came with.

"This roll-up back is awesome for organizing. I was able to organize all of my current skincare routine in use into the 4 detachable storage compartments. It was very easy to hang up in my bathroom for easy access and when I need it for travel or to take to another room, it's simple to take back down. I love that it rolls up to save on space as well. The storage compartments are a decent size and can fit a good amount. I was able to fit a full 15 step skin care routine with out any issues or sacrifices, everything was able to have it's own place. I highly recommend this bag for traveling or just for organization.

"These arrive with the lids and bottom separately wrapped and the bag of both bubble wrapped. The individual pieces are easy enough to separate for use with just one hand. The containers are see through as pictured. The lids do have a bit of a dip in them, so you will need to not fill them past the lines on the sides of the container.

I love that these are the perfect size for single serving sizes. I was able to use these to store left over spaghetti sauce, single burger patties, and smaller portions of food. I love that I can reuse these and don't have them be a one time use thing like a ziploc type bag. Definitely helps in the effort to save money by not only saving trash but also saving smaller amounts of food quantities. The seal on the containers is also very good. As I mentioned above, I was able to store spaghetti sauce in them without worrying that the containers would tip over and spill the contents all over my fridge. I also like how these stack. It makes organizing my left overs easier to see what I have available without taking up as much space. The containers being see through also help me to see what is inside the containers. I am also able to write on the lids the date and exactly what is inside.

Overall, these are a great investment.

I was thinking I could do a few different things with me but when I got them they are small lights on a thin wire. The only thing thats big on it, is the solar box.  It took me a day to figure out to be honest. I had no directions with it. I knew it sits outside but thats about it. The good thing about them they are really long! So you can just about put them anywhere.

There is a power button on the back but there is not switch so you really cant tell if its on or off. I wished the button was a switch so you can at least tell. I set it outside for a whole entire day. I tried to turn it on about dusk time and I couldn't get it to work. I was getting mad at this point. So I sat it down and walked away for a while, maybe for like 30 minutes or so. So when I went back to it, it was completely dark outside and guess what?  It worked! After I got it to work they are really pretty.

"Overall - Amazing denim jacket, decent quality and very cool looking.

I was given the opportunity to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All my opinions are 100% my own, and I myself rely on Amazon reviews so I would never try to persuade someone in the wrong direction.

I knew I loved this denim jacket as soon as I pulled it out of the package. It's clearly great quality and doesn't feel cheap at all. The design I chose is kind of an acid denim wash with patches look. It doesn't look as overexposed as it does in the pictures, which I was worried about so I am happy with that. I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend any guy to add this one to their collection.",1
"Upon receiving the Willow & Everett Salt and Pepper Shakers I first noticed they were packaged very well to insure to the safety of the product. Sometimes I worry about ordering items that are glass and I always have a fear of it arriving broken, but not with this product. They really took care to insure its safe arrival, and it arrived in just a few days. This very eloquent design will fit any dcor in your kitchen and dining room. I found that they were easy to load with my favorite Pink Himalayan Salt and Red Pepper Corns. You can move the dial for a fine grind or move it up for a larger grind on both containers. Not only that, they ensure 100% satisfaction or your money back, it cant get any better than that. This would be great to receive as a gift.

"So when I bought this shirt I was thinking that it would be regular camisole tank top. Well when I put the top on it came to just under my breasts. I have experienced clothing running small when I have ordered online so I ordered it in an extra-large so that it would fit well needless to say I had to give this to my 7 year old niece and it fit her and covered her just fine.  Now if the crop top means, to us old people a belly shirt, my bad.  The tank was nicely made and was very airy and light perfect for the weather that we have where I live.  It looks adorable on my niece and I am glad that she was able to wear it.  The package came right on time and I was able to get it before the holiday weekend so that was amazing.

good quality umbrella for gentleman,0
This a very handy cable to have. I had an unused Display Port on my laptop and this allowed me to connect an extra VGA monitor that i had hanging around. I also tried it on a projector and it worked fine as well. The cable itself is very robust and well built and looks like it will last a long time. That does make it bulky at the Display Port end  but i prefer a good cable vs a cheap flimsy one so im fine with it. I have bought other cables from UGREEN and have been satisfied. This cable they sent me free to test in exchange for an honest review.  They definitely make great cables at very reasonable prices and i can honestly recommend them. I will continue to by from them in the future. .,1

"A very nice case even if you don't use the belt clip.  The phone has a great no slip finish and fits well in my hand.  It has a solid feel and it is very well designed. The case doesn't snag in my pocket either.  I also like the covers for the power, headphone jack, and silence switch.  They are easy to open and stay closed. The access ports are big enough to fit your finger to use the switches. With some cases the plugs are difficult to use but all of my charges andaudio out cables fit wonderfully.  The cover for the power switch and volume are raised and work without any issues.  Often with cases the screens edges are difficult to use but not so with this case.  The whole screen is accessible..  I really like this case.  I have a glass cover for my screen and I had no problems with the case fitting even though it has its own built in screen protector.

The clip part fully rotates so it can hang at any  angle you desire, and the phone pops in an out effortlessly.

There are a few small things I dislike.  The screen cover smudges easily and I don't really need it to protect my sreen protection glass.  It looks like it is easy to remove. Also, it doesn't cover the top speaker and front camera as well as my glass screen protector.  Also, it's me being picky , but the opening at the top for the area with the front camera and speaker is slightly off-center.  It's hardy noticeable and may just be a defect it my batch.

Overall this is a great case and I prefer it over otterbox.  It looks like it will hold up better then the competition and blows them out the water in terms of fit feel and functionality.

"I ordered this in the L and while the top fit me with no issue, the bottom did not. I typically wear a L/M bottom so I recommend ordering a size up just for the bottom piece. The top half will accommodate pretty much any size, I'm a D cup and I had no issues.

The bikini is a cute print though, the top was easy to put on. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star is the stitching. The stitching had a few loose threads on it.

"This seems like it will protect my iPhone screen well enough. However, I do wish it covered the whole screen, but understand that most iPhone 6 Plus cases don't cover the entire screen. This is the main reason why I took off a star. Because it doesn't cover the entire screen it didn't line up well the first try, so I had to pull it off the phone. Then, (luckily because This comes with 2 protectors) I tried again. This retry turned out better and looks and feels great. However it still isn't perfect, but maybe it's this way with all 6 Plus cases (or maybe I'm just clumsy). One of the nicest features are the smooth edges so you aren't losing the feel Apple designed for the phone. I feel that if I dropped my phone it wouldn't break. One change I would make is giving more detailed instructions, as they don't include steps for all the products included. To close on a higher note, the glass is clear and the screen retains all sensitivity and feedback with no delay.

"We are using this in a copy room to sort numbered/lettered tabs.  We ordered 4.  It's okay.  Not great but not terrible.  It works fine.  We'll be interested to see how long it holds up.  If it does hold up well, I would rate it a 4 or 5.",0
"Good case. Feels sturdy. Textured on the sides to prevent the phone from slipping from your hand. The plastic screen cover is responsive to touch and typing. I have not noticed a big difference between typing with it or without it. However, the plastic screen does get scuffed and scratched fairly easily. After having this case for a couple of weeks, there are many permanent scuff marks and scratched that are beginning to appear. They are small and are only noticeable when the screen in turned off.  The covers for the charger port and headphone jack are difficult to pull out and do not fit back into their spaces cleanly after being pulled out to charge. Overall, this is a decent case at a reasonable price for the protection and minor flaws.",0

"In Arizona, we have birds stopping by year round - we always have a feeder or two hanging from the trees in the backyard. As soon as I saw this Bird Feeder I knew it would be a fun to add to our home. The 3 suction cups are incredibly strong and have already made it through 2 Arizona windstorms. The birds seem to love it & we have noticed the same few keep coming back. We filled all three portions with food & the birds are loving it! I put it on a window that is over rocks so the bird poop wouldn't be on our patio & we can sit right there and watch the birds eat if we hold still enough. It's so much fun & absolutely beautiful to see the birds up close. This would make a fantastic gift for any family, bird enthusiast, or toddler :) in our case. We are having a blast!

"This is exactly what I wanted in a bath mat. I needed something to help me keep my slippery, squirmy baby from slipping around during bath. I had bought a different mat earlier and it worked too but had a deep pattern on it that would turn his legs red and leave a big imprint when I would sit on it. This mat does not have that problem. It has all the non-slip functionality and is comfortable to sit on.

"I removed the handles to add surgical tubing so I could still hope it after cooking in it, and not the handles won't bend back into place. They are very loose and quite a pain.

"I had put off ordering one of these because I wasn't sure I'd like the way it felt when I was typing.  I figured it'd feel bulky. I liked the idea of protecting my computer, however, and I liked the ombre effect of the gray darkening to black, so I figured I'd give it a chance.  I'm happy that I did.  The cover fit my keyboard perfectly and is very easy to put on/take off, it's basically a silicon mat that just sits right on top of the keys, but securely enough that I don't worry about it falling off.  The backlight of the keyboard still shows through the cover, which is good.  As far as typing on it, there is a noticeable difference, however it is easy to get used to, and doesn't make typing feel uncomfortable or difficult in any way.  Now that I've been using it for a few days, I would definitely say I'm happy I made the purchase.

"Delivered earlier than I expected, packaging wasn't that great, no protection, just a thin plastic bag & the case was in a plastic zip lock bag inside that.
  There are 2 pieces to this case, the firm rubber inside piece and the hard outer shell (not flexible). The buttons don't give any trouble when pressing  (it's the firm rubber part). All the cut outs are where they should be and line up perfectly. Plenty of room for wires plugged in. The case fits my S7 Edge very snug and gives it a very solid feel in my hand. The outer shell is not metal but does look it with its ""brushed metal effect"". It's a real nice looking case. It is slim but still feels solid. The corners are raised high enough that my phone doesn't touch any surface of placed face down, only the rubber inside touches whatever I place it on. Going by looks, it is a very classy looking case. Very impressive.
  Now protection is what is most important to me, I love my S7 Edge, and I did question if this case would be able to protect it. I got my answer rather unexpectedly, walking out of work, I was in a rush and didn't realize I hadn't placed my phone all the way down in my back pocket, and my hands were full. I heard something fall behind me on the cement sidewalk. I was honestly afraid to pick it up,it was face down. The first thing I looked at was my screen, I do have a cheaply priced screen protector on that I got elsewhere, my screen looked fine. They case was scuffed up on the corners pretty bad. I put up pictures. I took my phone out of the case to examine it, it didn't have a scratch on it. I was so happy, but at the same time I was crushed that I ruined the case. It must have bounced because 3 out of 4 corners were badly scratched and had imprints from the cement. Now I would never take a chance like this to test a case. And I had never dropped my phone on the cement ground before this. It was definitely are hard fall and the case shows it, but the whole point of a case is for protection, I really didn't think this case would have protected THAT well but it did. I took all the damage instead of my phone. For that alone it gets 5 stars. I may order another one because I do really like this case.
  I was given this case for free to evaluate and give an honest unbiased review to help other customers decide if this would be right for them. I rely on reviews for all my purchases so I take it seriously when I review. I hope this helps someone decide for themselves if this is the case for them or not. Feel free to ask any questions, I'll do my best to answer.

"I'm a sock loser.  The funny thing is that I do my own laundry, in my own washer and dryer.....so how is it that my socks are always missing?  Where do they go?  I have no idea.  There must be some sort of time portal somewhere that they fall into....

So I always need new socks, and I need them to be low cut and comfortable in a variety of footwear.  These socks fit the bill, but they're actually better than I was expecting.  The colors are so great. The product listing says black-grey-khaki, but it's really black, grey, and the most delightful shade of ballet pink.  Not baby pink, not cotton candy pink.  It's the exact shade of the famous OPI ""Bubble Bath"" nail polish, if that helps.....

They're not thick socks, but that works for me.  They're low enough that they work with lace-up shoes and booties, which is exactly what I was looking for.  I wear a US Women's Size 8.5 to Size 9 in shoes, and these socks fit me fine.  An all-around home run.  And at the rate my socks disappear, I may be back for more pretty soon.

"I received this product at a discount for a honest review. I love that there are so many options out there for replacement Alta bands. It's great to easily change out the band based on my outfit and/or mood.

Ldaai's bands are okay. There are clear upsides.  The bands are strong. I honestly can't tell a difference in the weight or strength of the bands from the more expensive name brand ones. The color is true to their description as well.

There are a few downsides, however. I couldn't get the smaller of the bands to slide neatly into place at first. I noticed upon inspection that the tiny screw that holds the metal bracket in place was about to fall out. This was more of an inconvenience than a design flaw. I took a tiny screwdriver and tightened it up and it worked just fine.

The other downside was that there is a small amount of discoloration on the band. At first, I thought it was dirt, as it was just slightly darker in a few places. After cleaning the band it's still there. It's very small and I'm going to be working in the yard with it so it'll probably get more marks on it. It just struck me as strange. These bands totally function correctly. It's just the quality of the appearance that really makes me opt for a different choice.",1
"No complaints here.  I purchased this product for my geriatric 18 yr old kitty with bad hips.  I am also using therapeutic fish oil suppl and Adequan injections.  Over all she is doing better, more active, more social.  I did get some on my finger and my 75 lb mixed mutt wouldnt lick it off.  I tasted it, its bitter, but kitty gets this in her canned food and fish oil and inhales it.",0

"Background:
Our daughters are now sharing a twin bunk bed. The only sheets we had were the ones that came in their bedding sets and 1 extra set. Everyone knows it's important to have a few backup sets of sheets for kids.

Color:
The turquoise color is vibrant and very pretty. It is a bit darker than in the product image, but that could just be how it's showing on my screen. Either way it's very nice. I'm thrilled we got lucky enough that they closely match the comforter sets.

Fit:
Due to these being XL size, and able to go on mattresses up to 12 inches deep, I wasn't sure whether these were going to be too big. We have 5 inch deep memory foam mattresses. I thought I'd have to buy sheet straps to hold the fitted sheet in place. These can easily be folded underneath a 5 inch mattress without the sheet coming loose. The pillow case is true to standard size.

Quality:
The sheets we received were sewn perfectly. I examined everything thoroughly and found no sewing issues, no croaked seams, no holes, and no snags. There were a bunch of loose threads on the sheets, but they appeared to be extra random pieces. The material feels a little rougher than I anticipated, but it still feels nice and doesn't scratch at all. It's kind of shiny, which I really like.

"I wanted to try this product for my mother-in-laws dog that has severe anxiety while traveling. During the father's day trip he wore this shirt and his anxiety was noticeably less; it isn't a 100% problem solver but it does have an effect. The build quality is better then I expected. I am not sure if the shirt really calms them down or it confuses them to the point to where they forget about why they are anxious... either way it did the trick.

"If you need a backup charging cable, this would probably be the one to get (at least until Fitbit gets the name brand cable back in stock)

This is a replacement charger cable for the Fitbit Alta.

This charger looks almost identical to the one that comes with a Fitbit Alta. It charges the Fitbit Alta just as fast as the original cable. It is held snugly in place with the Alta by use of the pinching mechanism.

The cable material itself is the same (or very close) to the gauge that comes with the Alta.

The length of the cable is about the same as well. I wish this was a bit longer, but it is alright for carrying around.

I suggest you get one of these as a backup charger BEFORE you lose your current charger, otherwise you could be without a charger for a few days (or 1-2 weeks if you order from Fitbit itself)

While the cable on the official website is on 1-2 week backorder, I would go with this. Otherwise, you're not saving that much money to get a non name brand cable.

I would rate this 5/5 as a replacement cable. This looks nearly identical to the fitbit cable, and charges just as fast. (They also claim to have an 18 month warranty on this cable, vs Fitbits 12 month warranty)

"First said I got this product for free in return for a review.  That said I will have to say it is a very complete kit for install.  The instructions are simple and easy to follow.  I will let you know in advance you will want good lighting in order to have the easiest time installing this screen saver.  Due to it being a non-glare type it is hard to spot where the button position is in dim lighting.  That is all the bad points.  The rest is all good.  It installs like most other screen savers and is not at all hard to put on the phone.  With the anti glare finish it does help in bright sun light a great deal on making the phone easier to read.  It will also help protect the screen form getting cracked, chipped, or just plain broken due to the slightly thicker and more flexible surface this screen saver gives that phone face.  I have not tried to remove it so the company's clamed no mess removal can not be confirmed but is not a real deal breaker in my book.  I am far more worried about a broken screen than a little harder time cleaning the phone when putting on a new screen protector.",1

"I love these chalkboard labels!  They are a great size with cute designs.  The labels are sticky enough to stay on the bottles and are not flimsy to where the labels stick to themselves and get ruined.  I am not that crazy about the chalkboard pen though.  After reading the directions to get the chalk ink out of the pen, it writes very smoothly and evenly.  However, the ink takes a long time to dry - it kept smudging when I peeled the label off the paper to put it on the bottle.  Also, the pen has too thick of a tip for my personal preference.  I am using these chalkboard labels for essential oil creations and would like to list the recipe on the label, but can't with how thick the writing is.  I have attached pictures to show this.  I will keep practicing and perhaps I will be able to get more information on the labels at done time,  as I do have larger handwriting anyway.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for writing this honest review.

*******EDITED TO ADD:  I have continued using these labels daily and have found that the chalk does not stay on well at all.  At first, I thought that it was only if it got wet that the chalk came off.  However, I soon discovered that even when I allowed the chalk ink to dry thoroughly before touching it and took care to not get it wet, that the ink still wore off very quickly.  I have also ended up with white residue on my hands after using the bottles that I have these labels on.  The white residue does wash off my hands easily, but it is still frustrating that the chalk won't stay on the labels.  The labels are still holding up wonderfully!  They have not peeled off accidentally and they come completely clean of the chalk.**************",1
"This cake decorating set is a great starter set for the beginner! It's not fancy or complicated, but straightforward and simple to use. There aren't any instructions included, but the process is basic. Inserting the tip you want into the small end of the bag and then twisting the plastic cap over the tip makes for a tight fit that doesn't allow any frosting to leak. It's a convenient set to get the kids involved in decorating cakes/cupcakes. It's great that there are 6 different tips to try so you can see what types of decorating you like best. !he bag is large enough for a substantial amount of frosting and easily let us decorate 2 dozen cupcakes without refilling. It is easy to clean too!

I will highlight why these are great for casual home use, and not great for other things.

Ideal for home use because:
- These have very comfortable ear pads. They're soft and fit nicely on your ears.
- These are on-ear headphones, not over-ear. This means that the pads rest on your ears and don't completely envelope them. This will affect your listening experience.
- The cord is about 6 feet long. These are much longer than your normal earbuds and make for a comfortable listening experience.
- These headphones are compatible with most devices out of the box. You won't need to install special drivers to get the full feature set.
- These headphones look great. Plastic body, but they feel very sturdy.

Not good for travel/working out because:
- The ear pads can run hot on your ears. After 30 minutes of continuous listening, my ears were very warm. This is worth noting if you're looking to wear these for a long time and your ears get sweaty.
- There is a little bit of sound leaking. This means that others can hear what you're listening to at medium to high volume ranges.
- These headphones do not fold up. Not ideal for carrying around.

It's also worth mentioning that the volume rocker on these headphones utilize a slider rather than buttons. I p[ersonally prefer buttons since the slider on this unit is small and it is hard control. However, after getting use to these headphones, it's likely that you'll be able to more precisely control the volume output on these headphones.

In summary, these headphones are great for home use and not as great to carry around.

"Holy moly does this blood look real. I purchased this both for the photogenic qualities and for pranks, and I so cant wait to use it for that. This fake blood looks and feels exactly like real blood. As it pools and drips down your arm or chin, a fresh red pigment, even the streaks like wiping the blood off you looks realistic. If you wipe too much though you'll see the stain more so than a blood look so I think this works better naturally flowing on its own so I wouldn't ""shape"" the look so much unless you have a layer of wet fake blood to cover the stain marks which isn't hard to achieve and still get the look you want.

I didn't use any applicators but a pipette would work great with this. I used the tip of my middle and pointer finger to get my desired look. It didn't stain my hands at all (but that could be because of the soap i used), but it did leave a stain under my nail and around my cuticles.

As far as ingredients go, I looked them up and they all appear to be common ingredients in cosmetics BUT Imidazolidinyl urea and triethanolamine can cause an allergic reaction if you are allergic to them. Hydroxyethylcellulose is used in this as the thickening agent (also common in cosmetics).

A little of this goes a really, really long way. If you aren't staining clothes for a bloody look you aren't going to use much of this at all so this should last a really long time.

From quality to price and just how realistic this looks I am extremely happy with this product.

I received this jastore girls letter yep clothing set the other day in the mail. The girls outfit was packaged very nicely and avoided any damage or tampering during its shipment. The clothing set arrived fairly quickly thanks to the speedy processing of the great seller. I got this for my almost three year old daughter. I absolutely love it!!!! it is the most adorable outfit. The skirt is a silky feeling with a few layers in it. The tank top is cute being a muscle cut and is just a simple white tank but it is a very soft material. The outfit fit a bit large on my almost 3 year old however I ordered it a bit big and she is large for an almost 3 year old. I have already washed this outfit and it withheld normal washing.

"Third pair of daily shoes in last two months. I freaking love them! I own a sealcoating business so i need black boots, i am on my feet all day but i also want to look like a lady obviously! So these are fashionable and good for work. These have the rubber hill that all the daily boots (2 pair prior to this one) have had that absorb shock really well which helps me with back pain.

"I didn't realize that this bulb is not the common twist-in E26 base that Im used to, so I ended up having to get a E26 > GU10 base adapter to use this bulb.

Once I got it installed, I downloaded the PLAYBULB app on my Samsung S7 and connected to the bulb via Bluetooth on my phone. I didn't have any problems finding or pairing the bulb.

The app itself is reasonably well-designed and seems primarily oriented for party light type use  bright colors and fancy effects. Light Control has several options for color selection and transitions. Scene lets you select a color from a photo for truly customized light control. For example, I snapped a picture of my shirt and tuned the light to match.

The app also allows you to set a wake up behavior (turn on or switch color), a sleep behavior (turn off), and two custom timers. These allow you to gradually transition the light brightness and color over a period of time you specify (up to 30 minutes) at certain times of the day.

It took a bit of fiddling and experimentation to truly understand some of the apps different features. Some suggestions for additional features for the app: gradual color hue shift from 6500K (daytime) to 2100K (evening) as the day wears on for healthy sleep habits; change color according to music playing on the phone; more granular timer options (such as only weekdays/weekends)

This is a 40W equivalent bulb, so it won't light up a whole room like a 60W incandescent bulb can. It seems like it would work better in a grouping of multiple bulbs, or as an accent on a special focal point in the room.

"It's a lot taller than I thought it would be. I'm a woman, 5'6"" tall, and the bag is the length of my whole back. Having the straps tight enough so that it doesn't hang down makes the top handle (between the straps) press against my neck. I had to loosen the straps which makes the weight not distribute across my hips as well. I like it enough to not return it. If I was taller it would be no problem but I'm not even that short.",0
"I initially received a sample of Wondercide from a  web site.  Although it was a very small bottle, it worked wonders.  It is made for humans as well as pets animals and I took advantage of trying both.  On myself,  a paper cut was driving me absolutely bananas.  It immediately took the sting away and it was gone the following day. My initial purpose was for my dog, who is allergic to everything.  In the summer, especially, his stomach gets red and irritated and he looses his hair.  Knowing he is embarrassed, I try to be the best mother possible to relive his irritation and anxiety.  I was so impressed with the sample, I ordered the full size bottle,  When it arrived, I was that much more excited that there were two bottles.

The cord is longer than the conventional apple's standard ear pod. The silicone inner plug fit quite well and seal without slip out and felt quite confortable. The sound is just amazing! Because of the tight fit, the outside sounds are barely noticeable thus improving the sound. They feel a bit heavy because of the solid aluminum housing of the ear bud, but it is not a factor and I plan to buy couple of more of these Apie K1S for my wife and a spare set to keep in my car.

"Love this dress! First because it has a little bit of spandex, which allows a little give when I wear it. Hopefully I will wear it soon to an upcoming wedding. It says it's a 1920's style, which is true, but I don't think it's limited to that kind of party or event. It is an elegant dress, with beautifully sequined beadwork.
There are tassels at the end of the dress which gives an illusion that the dress is a little longer than it actually is, which is important to me since I don't like wearing short dresses.
I chose the XL dress in black. I usually wear a size 14, and it fits me just right, (especially with the light spandex stretch).
I think this dress is amazing, well made, and unique, not found at your average store.

So happy that I purchased it.

"I have been looking for a pedometer to use lately, and I was fortunate enough to pick up this lovely device! I rate this device 4.5 stars.
Pros: This is lightweight and the clip is awesome (the actual pedometer is separate from the clip). It's flexible and stays onto clothes and pockets really well. I don't even notice it's there. The actual device is really small too, which I love. If you REALLY want to know your actual steps, you can calibrate it to your stride, which is a very nice feature. It also automatically restarts each day. I don't really need it to be exact, but I may calibrate it later, but even so, it's pretty darn accurate already with counting steps even with the standards already put into the device.
Cons: My only real con is the fact that I wish the pedometer were completely calibrated for ready use right away-- it almost is, but you still have to change 12 hours to 24 hours and wade through several instructions, while easy, not necessary for the novice user. Instead, it should be completely calibrated so the instructions should read: ""Ready for use, clip on and start walking! But for those who want more calibrated steps, read on."" Otherwise, the user can get bogged down and overwhelmed right away with the device.
Overall, this is a really nice product, accurate, small and lightweight, with a lot of great features!

"I received the product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  In no way, shape, or form will it influence my opinion.

For the TLDR crowd (Too Long Didn't Read) - its a nice (read cheaper) comp to the GoPro.  Would recommend to a friend and would buy again if I needed it.

For the things that stand out-

First the good:  Packaging and shipping were both great. Amazon has this down pat.

Camera size is great.  I still find it amazing the things it can do for the compact size. Waterproof case size is 1 inch deep, 2 1/4 inches wide and 2 inches tall)

I really liked that it came with an extra battery plus all the accessories / attachments allow you to hook it to just about anything (except a chest rig)

The wrist remote is extremely handy as well especially when you have the camera mounted to your head.

The 1080p w/ 60 fps video is the best out of the choices.

The bads:
Battery life isn't very long - round abouts an hour. The really bad thing is the lack of a charger separate from the camera.
You either have to buy an additional charger or take the camera out of commission just to charge the battery.

The SD card is a little hard to get out but I keep my nails clipped short & have short fingers.  The cards spring loaded so I just use my pocket knife to push on it.  Definitely not a deal breaker but a minor pita.

The 4k option is kinda choppy for now.  Maybe a software update will take care of it in the future.

The still photos aren't very clear if you zoom in.  Its not that bad but worth mentioning if this is the main purpose you're buying it for.  I have a digital slr for pictures and bought this for video.

Features available but not tested:

Really like the concept of the waterproof case and am looking forward to testing it this summer at the lake.

The EZ icam app, need to update the os on my phone before I can install it.

Just my honest opinion and your mileage may vary but all in all I'm happy with it.  I think its a great little camera available at a fraction of the cost of the

Update #2, 6-24-16.  The rear screen goes blank after a few minutes of shooting video (assuming this is to save on battery power - which is a good thing)  Anyways, when using the remote AFTER the screen blanks out the remote will not work to start or stop the camera. The remote works fine starting and stopping BEFORE the screen blanks out.  I can push the power button to bring the rear screen back on but the remote still won't stop or start.  End up having to cycle power to the camera to get it to function again. Its probably a glitch in the firmware and I can live with it.  However I am knocking the rating down to 3 starts because its a PITA to turn the camera off to stop the recording.

Contacted the seller - Express Source.  Upon first contact they completely missed the problem with the remote in the reply and focused on the screen going blank.  Basically confirmed it was to save power.  Had to contact them again and pointed to the real problem was remote.  Exact response ""A hard reset usually resolves this issue.

"I am reviewing AGymnastics Rings With Adjustable Straps For Crossfit , Strength Training , Pull Ups and Dips

Packaging 4/5: The box was heavier than I expected. This is my first time purchasing rings like these and I was surprised by the weight.  The box was just a brown cardboard box with a giant sticker on one side. I would not consider this a ""retail ready"" box, but it displayed the contents  and was in good condition.

Instructions 0/5: There weren't any instructions I could find. none printed on the box and no loose instructions in the box.  I had to play around with the tie downs to figure out how they went together. I'm still not 100% sure I have it right or if I'm using the rings correctly. If you are familiar with rings this probably won't be a problem.  Also, I'm sure there are some youtube videos out there. It just would have been helpful to make sure I was securing them correctly before I put my whole body weight behind them in hopes that I don't fall.

Construction 5/5: I would consider these great rings.  My more experienced body-weight fitness friends told me to use hockey tape on them to increase my grip and make sure my hands aren't sliding all over the place. I will do that once I get to more advanced uses.  For now, the durable plastic design works well for me because I can leave them hooked up to my kids' swing set and not worry about them getting moldy or something (like wood would).

Use/features 5/5: They hold my body weight. They are bigger than I expected but that's because I am new to this sort of equipment and not becuase they are disproportioned.  Once you figure out how to use the metal adjuster for the straps they are pretty easy for getting on/off of where you set them up.

Overall: I am satisfied with this purchase and look forward to some gainz. I would purchase this unit even at the full price point because it works well for what it is intended.

I will have to update at a later time with the longevity of this product.

"I hate how it looks, but I like that it's durable. Kids love having a picnic in it.",0
"I ordered a 4x 6 and a 2x3. They don't match. Close but not the same pattern.  Pretty obvious when next to each other. The 4 x6 only measured to be 4.2x 5.2ft. Did it shrink while in transit? Nice enough rug, soft. It would be better if it was as described and pictured! The picture on left is of the Amazon site which does look like the 4.2x5.2ft.,  and the other pic is the smaller one we received!",0
"Easy pairing, simple controls, good battery life and sound quality.

What else do you want?",0

"Just had new flooring installed in my home.  One of the things I notices was the scratches that the previous flooring had from my office chair.  It was time to change chairs or wheels.  I love my chair...changed out the wheels with these and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! The advantages to replacing your old, worn or just cheap factory wheels are many but the main one is protecting expensive wood flooring finishes from damage. These have a softer compound to them that ensures they will move around freely without scratching or damaging the finish on your floor. They roll smoother and for me the big plus is that I was able to get rid of that hideous plastic floor protector. Installation was actually a lot easier than I expected. I used a long flat screwdriver to apply leverage to the crack in between the caster and the chair. This causes the mounting tube or pole to lift out of the chair and then I was able to just pull it out. One of the chairs did need a couple taps on the screwdriver with a hammer to pry it up but it was not too bad. Installing the new ones is just a matter of pushing the wheel down into the hole. I think the whole project took me 5 minutes. Time well spent on saving my floors.

"This speaker can withstand a lot of stuff. I really love that about this Firstop Bluetooth portable speaker. It's durable and great for the beach. The speaker is pretty loud due to its duel 10W drivers. It's HD quality sound and deep bass set this speaker apart from other that I have. The speaker connects quickly to my phone and there's never any lag time when I use the controls. The flashlight features is nice to have when the power goes out. It's not very bright, but it does the trick. Overall it is an impressive portable speaker. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",1
"BUY THIS!  It just randomly decides it's had enough and shuts off, taking with it power to everything I have plugged into it.  What a piece of garbage.  I've bought hubs for half the price of this one that work just fine.  FIND SOMETHING ELSE-ANYTHING ELSE!",0
"I bought this phone for my little sister, and I love it. For the price, this phone offers more than expected!",0
"I like this sauna belt a lot. I am a taller female with quite a long torso, so when I purchase these belts I am always running into the issue that they are just too short for me. They cover only half to one third of my waist length. This was the first one I bought that actually is long enough for my torso size. It's nice to finally get a sweat in my entire waist area. This sauna belt is soft, but I like that because you are able to be more flexible in it. It's quite long and I am able to wrap it with a good amount of overlap, so I imagine it would fit athletes of many shapes and sizes. I wear this on my stationary bike for 10 miles and by the time I am done my waist feels a whole lot smaller. It just gives you that extra edge on your fitness routine. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, however having gone through so many brands of sauna belts in the past, I am being genuine in saying this is my favorite so far.",1
"This boy's body suit onesies five pack is a great set. The cloth has a substantial thickness and will last.  The bottom snaps  snap securely. I purchased the 10 - 12 month size and the size is spot on.  I am happy with this product.

"This is a wonderful caddy. We have a very small kitchen so our utensils are kept on the lazy susan on the table.

The clean white plastic is smooth and shiny. There are small slits in the bottom of each compartment, making it 1. extra easy to clean and 2. gives you the ability to put just washed silverware in there to dry. It appears sturdy and hold A LOT.

I like that the napkin spot is large. You can use paper regular napkins, larger dinner napkins or even folded/ rolled cloth napkin and have a lot of space for each. It is compact and easy to use.",0
"Having a 10ft long cord enables me to be able to plug my charger into the wall and charge my phone sitting on the couch, recliner, back seat of a car, in bed..anywhere. The bright colors are awesome and the plug fits snugly into my phone and tablet unlike most aftermarket charging cords.

I did not receive this product free or at a reduced cost in order to review them. I paid the full amount and am reviewing them at my own discretion.",1
"I've had several boards before, from Hawaii to Ron Johns. While not the absolute top of the line, it doesn't cost at much as those either. It has been durable, the straps are well attached and if you are going to use it very often, it's going to be worth the money to get a better board (like this) than the cheap things sold at the beach discount stores. However, if you're just on vacation and don't want to haul it back or figure your kid is going to outgrow the size before they can use it 3 or 4 times, maybe you are better off with the cheap ones.

I've not used the fin tethers, but based on the quality of the rest of it, I'm not really worried about it. Love the 12 month warranty! I doubt I'll need it, but that is a strong offering from a company who believes in their product. Yes, I know electronics typically come with 12 month warranties, but they do not see the type of physical abuse a body board does.

I will note: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. Still, a great value for the board even at normal price. Good luck on the waves!",1
It was made so small it in no way would fit an average size person,0
"Up until now, I used a regular plastic drinking glass when enjoying a glass of wine. I am clumsy and tend to drop things, and my two young children are constantly knocking things to the floor. With the Evino unbreakable stemless wine glasses, I can now enjoy my wine in a grownup glass without worrying about the glass falling to the floor and shattering. These PET plastic stemless glasses truly are shatterproof. Even when one of the glasses fell from my countertop onto my ceramic tile floor, the plastic remained intact. The clear design is perfect for wine as well as my favorite seltzer water flavored with fruit juice. I feel like a real grownup while drinking from my Evino glasses!

According to the packaging, the Evino unbreakable stemless wine glasses are dishwasher safe on low. I pretty much put all my dirty dishes in my dishwasher. The box states, ""Our wine glasses can be washed in LOW temperature in the dishwasher."" The box does not specify a temperature, only low heat. My water heater is set to non-scald temperatures to protect my two young children from accidental burns. I also have never had an issue with anything in my newer model dishwasher getting to hot or melting. I was thus extremely surprised when one of my Evino glasses warped in the top rack of my dishwasher. Upon looking at the Amazon product page, I found a note stating that the glasses are safe up to 40 C (104 F), but you would not know that information from looking at the packaging. I am therefore wary about putting these glasses in my dishwasher at any temperature. My dishwasher does not get extremely hot, and I have never had anything else melt or warp, so I am not entirely convinced that the Evino unbreakable stemless wine glasses are truly dishwasher safe.

In addition to the four glasses, Evino includes a cute black hat-shaped bottle stopper in the package. You can use the bottle stopper to seal many types of opened bottles. Because these glasses are wine glasses, I have been using my bottle stopper to seal open wine bottles. The seal is very tight and secure. When I remove the stopper, I hear a satisfying pop that ensures me that the bottle was tightly sealed. I am quite impressed with this bottle stopper. None of my other stopper give me that satisfying pop when I reopen the bottle. I received a set of glasses in exchange for my honest opinion.",1
"I have always had problems with different sharpener's that don't work. I have tried different type of sharpener's from very low price ones to very expensive ones and they don't work or they stop working. This is a great sharpener that works and works and works! I have tried different pencil's and it sharpens them very fast without over sharpening them. I really like that it has a large pencil shavings bin, which means you don't have to empty it out very often unless you sharpen a large amount of pencil's. You do need to press on the shavings bin while you sharpen your pencil for the sharpener to operate. It has a suction cup design to firmly place on desks or any flat surface. My kids and I have been enjoying it so much since we are always sharpening different pencil's. I received this product for free or for a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. My opinion is 100% mine.",1
"In this day of ultralight, ultrabooks, smaller, lighter, and faster, one thing that's going the way of the Dodo is a physical disc drive. And while on the surface you might say ""well, that's fine, almost every major manufacturer puts their software and drivers online to download"", sometimes, they don't. Especially with legacy equipment and peripherals.

So it was with great gusto I agreed to give Novapolt's External drive bay. It uses the newer 3.0 USB connection that has a much, much quicker read/write time than the older 2.0 standard we've all used for forever, but it's still backward compatible with the old USB 2.0 and 1.1 standards. With a 24x speed on CD-r and CD-rw, and a 8x speed on DVD's, it should be sufficient for all you basic CD/DVD needs. It has a dedicated built-in USB cable, so no need to worry about misplacing it and being out of luck when you need it but can't find it. And thankfully it was truly plug-n-play with Windows 10 once I got a dedicated media player for videos. It's relatively quiet and can scarcely be heard over ambient room noise. I can't speak for the shock protection, so I wouldn't go running anywhere with it, or other such activities. And a unit like the Novapolt CD/DVD drive is indispensable for data backups. Nothing like having physical media to back up pictures, letters or to re-install your hard drive after a catastrophic crash. ""The cloud"" is fine for some, but I like the safety and security of knowing I have my data here, at my fingertips, at all times, and away from prying eyes.

It's not all wine and roses. To start, while it has a brushed aluminum look, it's actually plastic. So while I'm sure that saved a few ounces in weight, it gives an overall cheap feel to the product. Next is that dedicated cord. In the interest of handy onboard storage, Novapolt out of necessity made the cord very short, which means it's got to stay very, very close by. A minor quibble. My big gripe is the price. At the time I ordered, the Novapolt USB CD/DVD drive was priced at $34.87. And it doesn't play blu-ray discs. I noted several external blu-ray readers and DVD recorders for $24.99 and $15 respectively from major manufacturers. I don't know why Novapolt feels the need to charge so much, and I have a really hard time recommending them based on that, it's just way too overpriced. It did the job, but you can find more affordable alternatives.

I received the above product(s) free of charge from Novapolt. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.",1
This color is not rose gold or even close to the color of the phone itself. It is a metallic pink. Don't waste your money.,0
"I am so in love with this leather backpack. Money well spent. This backpack is amazing. It is genuine black leather, it is has 3 zippered compartments. The main compartment has a soft divider where you can story you laptop and it will not get damaged, on the other side of where your laptop rests, is a begin enough area to store books as well or whatever you would like to carry with you. There is a strap that Velcro's to the other side of the divider in the middle to secure you laptop in place, there is also a small zippered compartment. On the other side there are two pockets that you can store stuff in also. On the outside of the backpack there is a medium zippered compartment, this is where I store the charger for my laptop. On the outside of this compartment is a smaller zippered compartment, a good place to store your wallet, cell, keys, etc. It has a very secure hand handle on the top of the back and there are two adjustable straps on the back. This backpack is very well made and sturdy, stitching is well sewn together. The leather is soft and flexible. I recommend this backpack for any college student. Well worth the money.

"First, this is not just for Macintosh computers. I use Windows 10 and this drive plugged in and my system immediately recognized it. I was able to easily use the drive to install applications, watch DVDs, and import music off a CD. Lightweight and perfect for traveling. Uses a USB to plug into the computer. I didn't need to install any drivers or fuse with installing an application to use the drive. Just plug it in and the OS prompted me to decide what I wanted to do (based on the type of CD or DVD I put into the drive). I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",1
"Can't stress enough how much we like this cell phone bike holder.  My hubby wanted one that wasn't too high profile as he said the one I use sticks up too high and is annoying.

I received this at a free or reduced rate in exchange for my fair and unbiased review and that's what I've given.  I like it so much I've ordered another one at full price for myself!",1

"This Girl's Swimwear Swimming Bikini Two-Piece Set Was bought for my niece. She is a 5 year old and size 5T/6. I ordered the blue.
This swim suite arrived in a bag in my mail box.
I grabbed my mail as I was going to take my daughter to the park / beach. As it is early April I was only expecting to just play in the sand. But I noticed about 30 people playing in the water already in bathing suits.
There were other kids in the water. So I gave in and grabbed the bathing suite intended for my niece and that should be too large on my size 3t bottom 4t tops four year old.
I would say this for her, just 1 size to large.
The shoulder strap kept falling. And after a hour of use the bottles were droopy.
Now I bought the  size 6. So I would say this runs one size smaller than expected.

The color is nice, and it is made well. It is not high quality. But will stand up to use for the season.  I am still gonna give this to my niece. We just borrowed it is all.

Disclosure: I received this sample product at a discount in exchange for an honest appraisal of the item. I was asked to review it truthfully, no matter what star rating I gave, and I intend to do that. I do test out every product I get so I can give a worthwhile review. I hope that my review has helped in your decision to purchase this item or not",1
Easy to pull. It has a zippered compartment to seperate the halves so things stay in their place. Rigid outer shell protects the contents from damage. I am a motorcoach driver and I can fit a weeks worth gear in this case.,0
Not seeing  any difference with the UV filter in my pictures,0
"I'm usually not a sleeve person because of the material of other sleeves and not being able to use them while they're in there, but this sleeve is different. The sleeve is made of high material, easy to put in the sleeve, and it protects your phone from water. Though when i tried to take my phone out of the sleeve, it was a little rough to get out. Don't get me wrong, this is a great sleeve. The lanyard with it is the cherry on top, and i'd take this with me anywhere water is near.

I did test it out for water, and of course it came through flawless. It should fit most phones (It'd be pushing Note's and the IPhone Plus) and is honestly worth the money. For $10, you can't go wrong with this purchase.

The only flaws that'd I would say about this sleeve is how there isn't a way to hit the power button while it's in the sleeve, and it's a little bit of a struggle to get the phone out the sleeve, other than that it's fantastic!

"I wanted to love this bikini so bad. It says one size fits most.. well I'd like to think I'm average but this is way too small for me! I cant wear it at all. I'm not a huge person but I am not a dainty girl either. I have curves. I'm 5'5, 160, and wear about a 36-38 D and a big booty! lol  So if you are curvatious and thinking about this bikini, and unless you are really looking for a super sexy look, look elsewhere cause its is not going to fit! Sorry! The bottoms are wearable, but the top is like two triangles over my nipples. Though the print looks nice, the material is extremely thin also. I think I'm going to have to find a little girl to give it to. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. This in no way, however affects my review.",1
"Love these shoes.  I wear them almost every day, all day long.  The only drawback is the inside got a little dirty on my first wear because I was walking in park/grass/dirt area and it takes a little effort to clean it out.  They are the best shoes I've had in a long time.  I have fairly flat feet and over-pronate and these provide enough support for me, without being too much - some shoes have too much of an insert and cause me more pain.",0

"I don't usually need cable ties for anything in my profession so I just use them for stuff around the house or to make my life easier. I usually purchase them at the local dollar store where they come in a small pack and that's fine. These are SO much better than those! The plastic is much thicker and obviously better quality which would make any project they might be needed for even more convenient. I can't wait to find things to do with these!

"I really needed extra sheets for my guest bedroom. I actually only had one other set of sheets before these Scala Home Collections sheets.
 These sheets come with 1 flat sheet, 1 fitted sheet and 2 pillowcases. I love the blue color of these sheets although I wouldn't exactly call it a Sky Blue as the description indicated or as the photo showed. One of the things I really like about these sheets is the elastic goes all around the fitted sheet in stead of just at the corners. When I put this on the guest bed it made the sheet more smooth and I didn't notice any wrinkles.
 These sheets are described at 100% Egyptian cotton. I'll have to admit I am not that familiar with Egyptian cotton but I assume that means top of the line and I am not sure that I would say these sheets are top of the line having 300 thread count but I did see that the stitching seems very durable and they are soft enough that I will allow my guest to sleep on them. I do feel that for the price paid for these sheets they are very well worth it.

"I wear a 16""/35-36 dress shirt and this fits well for a XLT shirt, a little generous in the body but that's to be expected, it's not a fitted shirt.

"Edit on 7/27/16:  These were a 5 star, however they broke today, after maybe 3 weeks of not-daily use (probaly 3-5 times a week).  It's disappointing, but they were nice while they lasted.  I'm hoping I just had a faulty pair.
------------------------

I hate headphone cords.  I always manage to accidentally tug them at the right (wrong?) angle and yank them off my head or out of me ear (depending on the type).  They're especially a pain in the butt when Im working in the kitchen.

I got a chance to review these and jumped at the opportunity.  And I'm so happy that I did.  There was a small learning curve for me (I only just became familiar with using bluetooth), but I sorted it out.  The trickiest bit (which I'm still learning) is which buttons are where.  There is a card that comes with it that indicates this, but when I don't have it on me I have to rely on memory.

One thing I especially like is that the headset volume is independent to the device volume, at least on my phone.  So I can (despite all the warnings against it) set the volume rather loud.

I haven't been able to try this with my computer yet because I apparently have a non-bluetooth enabled computer.

Overall, very pleased with these and see much use in the future.

"Im using this bulb (daylight version) in my foyer, where I really like it rather bright when I walk-in.  Theres just one bulb overhead (recessed lighting) so thats why its even more important to me for it to be bright enough to meet my needs.  This one works perfectly.

My only issue with this bulb is the current cost.  I know LED is expensive, but its still a little high for me.  TCP offers other bulbs in multi-packs at better overall prices.  So you might have a look at multi-packs.  I have tried a few TCP bulbs and really like them though.",0

It holds a few credit cards or ID cards, coins and bills..The one drawback is it does not handle larger bills, such as higher denomination Euro bills, well.  The large bills get snagged by the zipper.

Full disclosure, I was provided this item free of charge in exchange for a product review.  I found the wallet to be a good value for the price had I purchased it.",1
"This light has been God sent for more reasons than one.

When I first ran across this bulb, I simply thought ""hey, this looks cool"" and because I'm a techy type of girl who loves to try new things, I figured I'd give it a shot.  Little did I know how much I would not only like but love this light bulb.

I have been dreaming of days where I had a dimmable light that I didn't have to get up to turn off.  This bulb came in handy and right on time. The box includes the bulb, a remote and a set of instructions that explains how to program it in many different modes.  It installs just like a regular light bulb by screwing it into the socket.  Once installed, you can use the remote to do all sorts of things. It has two tones of light - cool and warm. Both tones of which can be brightened or darkened by a few pushes of the buttons on the remote.  I especially love this dimming feature as I have two small children whom are always in my bedroom.  The dimming feature makes it perfect to have a low tone of light but still be able to see unlike the lamp on my night stand.  The lamp casts shadows and makes it hard for us to read stories at bedtime. Whereas, this bulb used in my ceiling  fixture will light up the entire room even when dimmed.

There are a couple ways that you can dim the light.  The remote has preset dimmer buttons where you can do 10%-60% of its brightness.  In addition, you can manually dim your bulb just by pressing the up and down buttons to get it exactly how you want it. Another bonus, is that one remote can program up to 4 light bulbs which alleviates from having multiple remote controllers lying around.  I was unable to test this but I do plan to buy more bulbs in the future.

Overall, this is a must have. I was so excited when I first started using this bulb that I immediately contacted my supplier and told her to thank the sellers for such and awesome product.  I definitely recommend and intend to buy more in the future.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  I surely plan to buy more at full price.

They are very durable, the squeaker does give out after awhile, but it has never come out or caused any kind choking hazard just stops squeaking.  I would estimate each ball lasts me about 6-9 months, when I can't get it clean I throw it away.  I originally bought the package several years ago and I just now need to re-order.  I'm sold!",0

I usually wear an 18, and because I'm generally skeptical of sizes, I ordered a 2x but I could easily have gone with the 1xand been fine in the body but the arms in a smaller size would have been too snug probably. I've worn it like 3 times since I've got it/ it's cute with flats, with knee boots, and heels. I'm 5'3"" and it's over the knee on me- too short to wear to work without leggings but fine casually.

I purchased a similar glasses clip from Costco that was $19.99, made of metal and solid plastic, sturdy, easy to clip on, and actually felt like real glasses. This Cyxus brand is more like a thick film material. Even though I was fortunate enough to receive this product at a discounted cost in exchange for my honest review, I'm still considering returning these, as I simply won't ever use them. The look and feel flimsy and cheap.

"I'm really glad I found these - my HANC-250 headphones are my daily go-tos for my bus ride, but the finish was flaking off the pads.  Pay attention to the description - these do NOT contain the rigid plastic disks that snap off the headphones - they are just the pads and the black net fabric with an elastic section that you have to stretch to go over the plastic disks. If you have super-short fingernails you might want to grab a pair of tweezers or needlenose pliers to help get them on.  They are also not quiiiiite as puffy as the original pads - they flatten just a little more. But if it means not buying another pair of headphones? Win.",0
"As a student I'm always saving files and so I needed a flash drive after my most recent one constantly crashed and was refusing to open. This 8gb 2.0 USB flash is handy and of course crazy spacious. It was instantly compatible with my laptop and allowed me to store all my files that I had recovered from my old flash and within minutes I was on my way. I had no problem with driver installation and basically spent less time over flash drive frustrations and more time saving my work and moving along with my life.

"SOAIY's battery charger is kind of a unique battery charger. It not only charges AA and AAA batteries, but also an assortment of vaping battery sizes. It also uses a USB power source (an AC adapter is NOT included). The quality of the charger is okay, but it works flawlessly. The metal prongs are adjustable and will support other NiMH/NiCd battery sizes from 10440 to 26650. There is an LED indicator for the batteries, displayed in three stage increments. Overall, I like it. I haven't had any problems with it. *I received this product for review purposes. Products are judged on construction, quality, value, what they do, and how well they do it.",1

"My daughter tells me this is great!

She said it went on VERY easy - far easier than her old one - only a couple of small bubbles to squeeze out.. The kit includes a wet and dry cloth to clean your phone screen as well as a dust absorbing sticker to use before applying the screen protector. She showed it to me today and it does look super.  It seems to be very well made and is a little thinner than her last one. She's pretty hard on her phone and this looks like it will protect it as well as possible.

She also told me that her old cost around $25 at the Verizon store. Since this was only $7.99 including S&H it blows Verizon out of the water.

I received this at no charge for a full, complete and honest review.

I would rate this a very high 9.5 to 10 - it is really that good and you won't beat the price! Very highly recommended!!",1
"This jump rope is really great. I have only ever owned cheap dollar store jump ropes and have not bothered with them since I was a kid since they are pretty much considered kids toys, I really have not even thought of them. I saw this jump rope and remembered how much I like to jump rope and thought it was great that it is made for adults! I ordered a green one but ended up with a pink one when it came in. I was actually really excited about the mix up because I really wanted the pink one. I decided on the green one since it would be a neutral color and my husband would be more likely to use it too.

  So when I opened the jump rope up, it was in a plastic bag inside of a black carrying case. I took it out of the carriyng case and opened up the plastic bag. The jump rope is shiny and pretty. The handles are polk a dot which I think looks really cute. The polk a dot part is the rubber grips that are there so the handles do not fly out of your hands. Now I wanted to use it to jump in my house but it was too long. I looked at the directions and low and behold it is adjustable. You just unscrew the handle and pull the rope through, give it a little trim and voila! It is good to go. Now I wish there was a way to adjust with out cutting so it can be for different heights. Now I really do like that you can personalize it because that works for what I need. If you are vertically challenged then this would be a safe bet for you. I think jump roping is a fun way to get some cardio in. The pink rope is very high quality and over all I really am enjoying this jump rope. I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",1
"I left this same review on the single-lantern page, but I thought I'd re-post it here as they're the same units, just packaged into multi-packs.

This lantern seems to be punching above its weight in a good way. The materials all seem more premium than the price would warrant, and the lights are incredibly bright. I like the simple on/off operation and the built-in portability of having the lights recess down into the base, and using AA batteries is a bonus as I have those everywhere. The best part is it's so simple my 3-year-olds can operate it, which is what I want if there's ever a power outage. I ordered one of these on a deal and it's been worth every penny as a main home power outage light. I plan to get one to keep in the trunk of each car as well.

Pros:
- Compact
- Quality materials
- Simple operation
- Uses widely available AA batteries
- Nice feeling slide mechanism
- BRIGHT

Cons:
- At this price I can't think of any.

This product was provided by the manufacturer as a free review unit. My opinion is my own and is 100% faithful to my honest views on the product.",1
I've ordered a few different dresses and all have varied in quality and sizing when ordering the same size.  Sizing is inconsistent - hit and miss product.,0
"This is a really nice bike seat cushion! I was really surprised!  I originally bought it because sitting on the regular seat had just gotten too painful.  And I thought for the price this would just fall apart on me.  But I was desperate.

This was NOT a let down at all!! It was SUPER easy to set up.  You pretty much just put it over the seat and it covers it almost like a sack.  You pull a draw string with a locking clamp and I just tucked everything up under the seat when it was done.

And when riding my bike, I could TOTALLY feel the difference.  It's made of some kind of silicon gel like stuff that somehow redistributes my weight in a way that I'm not bearing down on any bone more than another! It just feels soft and cushiony and much more shock absorbing than my seat used to be before this cover!

I've been using it for a little while now and my pain hasn't come back yet! I will say that the seat does have a little wiggle to it.  I think that's because it seems to be a universal fit type cover, but it really hasn't been an issue at all for me.  I get SO much relief using this cover that I'm just so happy I got this and I hope you will be as well!

"My wife wanted this to help her fit in her pants better, and to work her waist down some. Not sure if it will help with weight loss, but as another reviewer suggested the tightness of it around the stomach makes you not have to eat as much to feel full. When we ordered it there was no option to pick a color, and she ended up with a pink one, which is cool because she likes pink. The top and bottom are not labeled so it was a bit difficult to figure that out so that it was not to tight up top, and loose down below, but once she figured it out it fit perfectly. She says she loves it and has no issues with it.

Delivery was quick and this seller shipped product promptly. Seller shipped item extremely fast and it was packaged very well. I would recommend people to buy from this seller. Excellent to do business with. I try to base my star rating of products on how my overall feelings about the product, here is a break down on how I determine my star rating of a product.
5 stars  I love this item! I highly recommend everyone purchase this product!
4 stars  I like it, but there are some flaws, but I would purchase this item again.
3 stars  The item was just ok, it worked, but I would probably not buy it again unless I had to.
2 stars  There are probably worse products than this, but there are definitely better choices.
1 star  I dislike this product, and I wish I had not bought it, I cant recommend it to others.

I will update my review in the future if I run into any problems with the product or if I find something I think would be of value to the customer.

"I ordered the Prive RFID Blocking Women's Wallet to use when on vacation.  We cruise every year and I thought it would be perfect to take! This RFID Wallet comes in several different colors. I chose camel because it's neutral and could be used with any color purse.

The wallet has two zippered pockets.  One pocket has accordion style slots to comfortably fit nine credit cards inside. The pocket opens up wide enough to allow the card holders to fan out so you can easily take them out.  This side of the wallet also has an additional pouch on the interior wall that another card could be put in. The other side of the wallet is like a coin purse, and has two pouches on either side to hold folded cash.

The wallet has so much more room than what is visible in the pictures. Even though I purchased this to use on vacation, I plan on using it often.

"Good, solid case. I like the look, and I think the protection is sufficient. I was initially skeptical of the kickstand, which doesn't allow it to lay flat on its back without wobbling. But, if I was really concerned with this, I could just pop out the kickstand anyways.

My only complaint is that it took almost two weeks to receive, and I live in the Midwest. Pretty disappointed in that respect. But, maybe Amazon Prime has spoiled me... I also ordered it the first day the LG G5 came out. Hopefully that was the cause.",0

"RUNS INCREDIBLY SMALL!!  I normally wear a XL shirt, but read the previous reviews and ordered a 3XL just to be safe.  I wore it unbuttoned over a long dress, but there is no way it would have comfortably buttoned.  Great sweat, but at least 3 sizes smaller than you normal size.",0
So far so good. I did replace the narrow spatula with a pair of scratch proof tongs. Items seem to be well built.,0
"Right now I am using the Bluetooth keyboard that comes with the case. It is the first time I have ever used a keyboard this small and I must say that it is easier than I thought it would be. I have medium length nails and am using them to type as opposed to the pads of my fingers. All the keys seem to work well. There is no sticking of the keys and response time seems good. I have not yet had any lag in typing. I am still playing with the function keys to see how everything works, and have not yet used the keyboard to take a picture. I am assuming it would only be for screen shots (like I am going to use to show you this) or selfies as the case would get in the way of using the backside camera. I like the kickstand on the case. It stands nicely and seems sturdy. Also I like the fact that the keyboard is removable from the case. It is held magnetically and you can just lift it off the case to make it easier to use. I am finding that to be a good way to have the tab closure out of my way as I type. All and all it is a very nice case. So far the only issues I have had are

 1. The tab that keeps the case closed is getting in my way when I am typing and if I fold it under the case, it tips the case up and the case bounces some when typing.
 2. Every time I open the case to use the keyboard I have to reconnect to the keyboard in my settings. Not a huge deal, just an annoyance.
 3. I just don't really like the tab closure. It keeps the case closed tightly which is nice but it is hard to get the tab in and out of the slot it slides into.

Good case for the price, especially since it has the keyboard to it. I would recommend.

"When I received the bag I was expecting something much smaller. I really didn't read the dimensions of the bag because I was excited about getting one. I try to make sure whenever I purchase something I use it as soon as I get it just to make sure I don't have any issues down the line when it's too late to return it or get an exchange. I'm going to start off with the top zipper sticks. I've read a number of reviews stating the same issue. Not going to lie, I was really hoping it was just a bad batch and maybe the issue will skip me but, it happened with me as well. I went to scour the internet to figure out how to fight the issue. If you purchase this bag and you have the same issue there are several items that will help out. I've posted them below following the review of this item. This bag is big enough for two suits(jackets and pants). I wouldn't try for any more than that. I folded my dress shirts and put them inside along with other items(underwear, socks, undershirts and toiletry bag) Everything seem to fit in there. This bag truly is a good weekend bag, it has the potential to be a great weekend bag if they would resolve the zipper issue. Maybe go with another zipper company or redesign the bag to fix the zipper issue(go with plastic instead of metal). I can't wait to really put this bag to the test when I go on my cruise in September. I do plan on putting up another review after I come back from the cruise.

 Items to use for stuck zippers:
- Graphite Pencil
- Windex(put on a cloth and wipe gently)
- lip balm
- bar soap(has to be a bar and not body wash)

"I received these in the mail a few weeks after I ordered as they do come from overseas, but I was wowed by the quality and fit of this set of gloves. I loved the pull straps at the top of the fingers to get the gloves off after a hot sweaty ride through the Florida trails.  These have great gel like feel in the palm heels that kept blisters away and allowed a great form fitting without feeling constrained throughout the whole gloves.  I have not washed these in the machine yet, so I am unsure of how they will stand up to multiple washings or what the feel may be afterward.

"First I have to say that I was beyond thrilled with these towels when I received them.  The colors are tasteful for any kitchen and the large size is perfect for almost any task. I washed them in cold water before using, and was still very pleased.  The sad reason I had to give these towels a 3 star rating is that after using them, I washed them in hot water, which is what is typically recommended for towels, and they shrank.  You can see in the attached pictures that they did not shrink evenly, and now they are crooked.  Still useful, but I am not happy with the quality and truly expected more from this product.  I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.",1
"Great color of armband, and appears well made as all the stitching is intact, edges even, material of a nice quality.  It is close to a universal fit I suppose, since it fits more than just my iPhone (based on their description.) For my iPhone, it was easy to insert on its own and it was still roomy.  I tried it as well with a slim case on my phone and it fit as well but it was a snug fit in comparison.  The holes for headphones and such will not line up perfectly, but it wasn't a big deal as my headphones still clicked in when adjusted.  Touchscreen still works great.  It will take some time to break in, as it was difficult getting it to close the first few times because it was still stiff and the band's velcro is quite thick. Not necessarily a bad thing though because it holds onto itself better with how thick it is. It has the key insert so you can workout without lugging all your keys.  One downside was that the plastic covering would not allow my phone to read my fingerprint. I am not a hardcore fitness guru but overall this feels like a good armband for my workout needs of jogging and walking.

"Awesome sound bar!!! I've loved every minute with it, especially when the sub-woofer gets to come out and play! :) Bluetooth, movies, games......it does a great job on everything and is really simple but still has a lot of sound customization you can get into if you want to.

"This is a high-quality umbrella. I've never owned such a nice umbrella, frankly. After destroying and losing a landfill's worth of $4 Ikea golf umbrella, it was time for an upgrade.

Here is a list of the things I like:
It's plenty big to share.
The button opens the canopy smoothly and with authority.
It has enough length and sturdiness it to be a viable cane if you need one.
It doesn't have prominent logos or branding (just one little embroidered ""Lifetek"" tab on the cover)
The handgrip is ergonomically shaped and comfortable to hold.
I haven't tried it in a high wind, but I have a feeling it can handle it.
... and best of all: YOU CAN SHAKE IT TRY IN A FEW SECONDS

Now, there are some tradeoffs for some of these features:
This is not going to fit in your purse.
It's on the heavy side.
If you're walking down a crowded street alone using this giant thing, you're going to be in an umbrella war. (The good news is that you will win this war due to your superior umbrella.)
It's way too nice to leave in the umbrella rack next to the door of the deli.
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with the slip-on cover when I'm using the umbrella.

I think this umbrella would make a good gift.

"These are my first pair of Bluetooth headphones and I love them! When they first I arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the packaging.  I have ordered other things in the past where the packaging does not meet my expectations, however, this exceeded my expectations by being very professional and sturdy.  I am happy that with these headphones that I don't have annoying wires that constantly get in the way.  One of the major things that I love about these headphones is that they fit my small ears.  With small ears, I have always struggled to find earbuds/headphones that would fit and stay in my ears.  I have always had to buy the wrap-around headphones, but even with those, I had to be really specific because even some of those wouldn't fit in/on my ears.  With these, they fit perfectly and I am confident that when using them, even exercising, that they will stay in place. I was interested in testing out how noise cancellation worked.  In order to test it, I put the headphones that I connected to my phone to listen to music at a comfortable noise volume.  Then, right in front of me, I started playing music on my laptop, slowly increasing the volume to see when I would start hearing an interference.  To my pleasant surprise, I couldn't hear start to hear the laptop right in front of me until around 75% of max volume and I was quite taken aback how loud that was when I took my headphones off. Unfortunately, I will admit that I am not a specialist when it comes to sound quality/bass/etc., however, I can say that the music that comes out of them is the same quality and even better than other headphones in the past.

I will admit that I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My review is completely honest and was not impacted in any way.",1
"This is a really good quality set for cool little boys who want to show off their love of turtles.  My little guy likes turtles.  He likes turtles allot.  So when I came across this product I had to get it for him and at this point I can say that I am happy that I did.  This is decent quality, we have washed it a couple times so far and it still looks great, I don't see anywhere that the washing degraded or faded the shirt and shorts at all.  The bottom line is that this is a cool set for your cool kid and it should hold up until he grows out of it.  I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  This is because I have review a lot of products on Amazon in the past and lots of people have found my review to be helpful (by this I mean that many people have pressed the ""yes"" button at the end of my reviews asking if the review was helpful).

"The cases for the iPhone were exactly as described. The material is lightweight and flexible so putting the case on and taking it off is very easy.  The material is thin enough to be flexible, but sturdy enough to protect your phone from scratches and bumps with extra thickness around the edges where it's needed the most. The sleek design also allows for ease in putting it in and pulling it out of your pocket and the silicone type material gives you a better grip to handle the phone. The cutouts fit the phone perfectly allowing for ease of use of all the ports. Some non-IPhone chargers don't always fit, but the ease of taking these cases off doesnt deter me from using them like other big bulk cases do. The power button and volume buttons are completely covered, but the case does not inhibit the use of the buttons. It comes with one screen protector that is easy to apply and a cleaning cloth to use. The colors are see through so you can not only display your case, but also your phone.

"The flood light is bright, I'll give it that. After taking it out of the package, I plugged it in to test it. I started cycling through all the different modes with the remote control to test everything. After a minute or two, something happened and it stopped responding to various button presses from the remote. I don't know if the remote went bad or the flood light is at fault, but it only accepts commands from certain buttons on the remote now. I can't even get it back to white light anymore because it won't respond to the white color button. I guess they need to work on their quality control some more. I'm hoping if I leave it unplugged long enough, it will clear the memory and default back to white light. When I try it again, if I see that the remote is working normally, then it's probably a heat related issue as I had it plugged in for a while when I was testing it.

I received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest review. This is my true opinion of the product and has not been influenced by this fact.

Edit: After reading my review, the seller sent me not one, but two replacement remotes and they both work great. I have complete control of the flood light now, so it looks like I originally received a defective remote. 5 stars for the great customer service. Thanks!",1

This will be handy over the garage door for when we come home after dark. As our spot lights that are motion sensored as well are mainly for our side yard instead of our driveway. This will make unloading the vehicle at the garage much easier. We have converted all of our interior lighting over to LED and now we are beginning the exterior of the house. Great way to save on your monthly utility bill as well.

He says
This is a solar LED motion sensor light for outdoor use. We plan on installing this over our garage door for that extra light at night when needed for unloading groceries or such. And to save on our dual floodlights from turning on being they are so expensive to run. The unit has 12 LED lights that are plenty bright enough to light up an area. The motion sensor is sensitive and can be tripped even by a large moth. The unit has 1 hole for hanging purposes and a pin that is used to turn the unit on or off. Overall we are pleased with this light and will put it to good use.

"The Kaka backpack is a very sturdy and well made backpack. It is made for years of use. This backpack is made of durable terylene oxford fabric. It is going to take a beating and still be usable. It has all kinds of room in it. It has a total of 9 pockets. 1 main zipper Pocket, 2 sides mesh pockets, 3 front zip pockets, 1 laptop sleeve and 2 inner small pockets. It also has many uses. You could use it as a laptop Backpack, a computer Bag, a sports or gym Bag, a travel Backpack, a hiking Bag, a camping Bag, a work Bag, a school Bag, Or as a weekend Bag. It is large enough for middle school, high school or collage. The approx Dimensions are 12"" L x 22"" H x 7""W and fits up to most 17"" Laptops. It also has bottle holders on each side for school water bottles or hiking water bottles. This is a nice thing for school, because I don't allow my kids to use public water fountains. There is even a strap that can be tightened to hold small bottles in place. The back pack is super padded to protect your laptop, tablet, cell phone or what ever you have in it. There are even padded back pads on it, padding on the shoulder straps and a stomach clip strap to keep from straining or causing stress on your neck and shoulders. The stitching is super thick and tight meaning it is going to hold a lot of weight and the seems are going to hold strong. The zipper is very thick. It zips and unzips easily every time without snagging or getting caught. The zippers are a very thick metal with a very sturdy rubber zipper pull on them. I did receive the Kaka backpack for free or at a reduced price for my honest and unbiased review and this is my thoughts of it 100%.
Summary/ Key Features:
-Outside material = Well woven (made). Strong although I'm not sure about weatherproof.
-3 pockets/sockets outside = 2 on top, variably spaced, but enough for a few extra things like bags of lunch, cables, etc. Lower bag has space for a travel umbrella, doesn't hurt to have one just in case, especially now that you have the room for it. The top two pockets outside have a nylon braided strap to tighten those parts. The bottom pocket has two straps on the side that tighten or loosen up to your preference.
Side pockets = 2 pockets, each able to hold a 20 fl oz travel mug (which is very large for a travel mug. Thus, the pockets are spacious as wel, and both have a strap to tighten or loosen to accommodate the contents in the pockets.
-Bag sides = a clip on buckle like mechanism to tigthen up the bag, or just to have something holding on there like a tripod for photographers. Each strap is able to be sized accordingly.
-Main inner compartment = 3 compartments inside with a couple of side pockets for pens, charging/phone bricks or exxternal chargers. The inside compartment is approximately 5-6 inches in depth and almost 7-8 inches in length. The main middle pocket is very spacious, and extends almost 2 feet in depth, and 1 and a half in length/width across a little less. The back compartment is protected/covered with a Velcro strap , and has the same depth as the middle one, but you can put a laptop in this one, so you wouldn't have your things mixed up.
-The back of the bag (what your back will be on) = padding on the shoulder pads, but not the middle or the lower half of the bag. Also soft padding on the bottom of the bag. I must say, the padding really helps as it's very cushiony and soft compared to regular bookbags.
-Shoulder Straps = paddeed as well, and adjustable in length like regular bookbags. They also have a buckle so you can tighten the bag close to you just in case you don't want it all over the place if you jog or run.
-Top handle = Very sturdy, has two types, one like a reguilar bookbag, and another that is coated with plastic/strong plastic like material that is strong and able to be gripped firmly.

In other words, a very strong versatile bag. It can be used for many occasions. School, Photography, laptop/school bag, maybe even hiking if you can pull it off. The color as well has a nice sleek visual when wearing it around. It's not like a matted finish, but not reflective, it's more so in between.

I like the occasional stitching of red around the bag. It doesn't make it look all black, and it kind of gives you an opportunity to match it with clothes you might wear which isn't that bad.

I've been using it for school so far, and I sort of feel out of place because in comparison to other students, this bag looks very professional grade.

You can also use it to store your clothes for the gym. Not to mention the spaces and compartments inside allow for multiple things to be stored
inside from small notebooks to pencil boxes, lunches, lenses, cables, etc.

Overall, a very well made bag, perfect for different kinds of uses, and resistant against rough use as well. For me, I especially like the padding on the back and on the shoulders, not to mention the outer pockets on the top for quick reach, and the slim design it has in comparison to other more expensive name brand book bags, they can't compete. A great bag for the price.",1
"I'm not happy with this product at all.  I wanted to love it but unfortunately this product didn't work for me.  I've had it for about two months.  At first there were no mosquitos outside yet to bother me so I wasn't able to test it out.  I never even opened it but last week we went on a field trip (my daughter and I) to some marsh lands. A perfect wet damp warm place  where I knew we'd be attacked by bugs. I got out my bottle and sprayed her and I head to toe.

First off, I'm not sure what others are smelling, but this stuff is horrendous smelling.  It's horrible.  My daughter was gagging (my little drama queen).  However even though it stunk, I took that to mean we were protected. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE!

Immediately upon arriving there we were bitten mercilessly.  I applied even more of the stinky solution. It again didn't work.  Eventually to my embarrassment, upon returning from the bathroom, another mom was loaning my daughter some bug spray since ""your mommy must have forgotten to bring any"". She saw my daughter digging at her arms.

Maybe my container was faulty. Maybe the marsh has super bugs.  I don't know, im not willing to try  again. I very rarely give a one star review. I feel like one star means you HATE it.  I don't hate much of anything.  Hate is a strong word.  However when a product fails as miserably as this one did AND its failure caused pain and discomfort for my daughter I have to say, yeah I hate it.

This review is for the Survival Hax Paracord Bracelet.  I purchased this for my 16 year old to use when we go camping.  He loved it the minute it was delivered and has since informed me it has such a nice look that he will enjoy wearing it more than just when we go camping!  My husband also tried it out.  They both like the paracord, said it is very good quality, and sturdy.  They also enjoyed using the whistle (it can be very loud!).  They tried out the fire started and were happy with it as well.  The knife is about 1/2 inch wide and an inch long.  It has a serrated edge and would work well for smaller jobs.  The bracelet was very easy to put on and buckle.  The seller is excellent!  I would recommend this product.  I received the bracelet at a discounted price in return for an honest review.",1
"This set is exactly what I need for my trip...I carry my home away from home and need these space savers/organizers. What I list below is exactly what I have placed in this set in so that I am all set for my trip.

Below I list how I am using the set and also the Pros:

1 Cube 1 - This holds my makeup (small set), comb, mini brush and small and thin dryer/curler brush.

2 Cube 2 - This holds my toothpaste, battery-powered toothbrush, small mouthwash, small rinse glass, and floss.

3 Cube 3 - This holds small vitamin bottle, misc herbal supplements.

4 Cube 4 - This holds my Three travel Chargers, Three USB Cables for my tablet, cellphone, very small Bluetooth speaker.

PROS:

1 Small, yet this still holds the items above. These fit into my large suitcase and I still had room for jeans, 2 tops, underwear plus this 4 piece set all in one large suitcase!

2 Bags are durable. When I am not using them, they fold up and all 4 fit together in a drawer.

3 Zippers open up fully so it is easy to access items in the bsgs. Also, zippers are well constructed.

Uses of this set that I suggest:

1 Traveling.
2 Storage Space in drawers.
3 Hobby article/parts.
4 So many other uses.

"This looks larger and not plastic in the picture. It's very cute and I like it a lot, I just thought I was going to be able to hang necklaces from it, but I can't since it's not tall enough. I use it for rings currently and the occasional hair tie. It's cute, and looks cute in my bathroom!

isclosure: I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate in order to test and give an unbiased review. As a longtime customer of Amazon, I also depend on others' honest reviews for purchases. The discounted rate of a product will not have influence over my personal opinion.
I purchase lots of items through Amazon, some I get for free, some I get at a discounted rate, and some I pay full price. I will always disclose if I receive an item for free or a discounted rate. I do a lot of reviews so here is a break down on how I determine my star rating of a product:
5 stars  I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend everyone to purchase this product!
4 stars  I like it, but there are some flaws. Don't we all have flaws? I would purchase again.
3 stars - It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless there are no other options.
2 stars  There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices.
1 star  I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and recommend others to not purchase.",1

"This swimsuit arrived in a nice zippered bag that would work great to keep a wet suit in. It is a great color and seems to be made well. I am a size 14-16 and I ordered the largest size (xxxxl) and the body of the suit fit well. The problem I have is with the bust. I have a smaller chest (38B) and the underwire bra cups on this suit were huge!  So big that there was no way I would ever be able to fill them. A friend of mine tried the suit on. (Size 16 clothes and 38D) and while she was able to fill the cups the halter tie was not enough support to hold things in place. I am not sure what the magic sizing is for this, but I was pretty bummed at I couldn't make it fit.

"Five star rating for this sexy and beautiful dress! I like dresses that are of unique style and when I saw this online I  had to have this one. It looks exactly  like the picture, unlike some other products where the picture is much more beautiful than the actual. This may be consider like a party dress but with the right accessories, it does looked very classy and elegant, specially paired with high-heeled shoes or sandals.  The cut and the length was just right. The material for which this dress is made of is very fine. It is not cheap at all. It is stretchy - the kind of stretch which goes back to its original shape and size, so this will not loosen up after some time but its size and shape will remain intact.  Overall, this is a very good purchase for its very good price and very good quality as well.

"I loved this bathing suit on my baby, but, I was disappointed after her dip in the ocean caused the gold to come off. It just faded and got everywhere. Her face, my lap and arms was glittery gold by the end of the day. This is a good buy for simply pictures. But not for more than 2 dips in the water. The bow is cute however.

Just what I was looking for.  Easily fit my sunglasses and reading glasses.,0
I like these socks. They are light and my feet feel good so far.,0
"These basting brushes by Daixers are much smaller and thinner than I'd anticipated. There are 5 of them so that's a plus. Having used these with barbecue sauce and also while cooking fish I've found that the bristles are not thick or stiff enough to handle barbecue sauce the way I'd like; it spreads it pretty thinly. However, they're perfect for spreading thinner stuff like butter. olive oil, or thin marinades. I like the bright colors as well

The good: Lightweight. Easy to clean. Doesn't take up a lot of room in the utensil drawer. The bright colors make them easy to find among all the other utensils. Five brushes in set.

The bad: Bristles not very thick. Bristles not stiff enough for thick sauces.

I wear new balance all the time. These are such a disappointment! It's  like they forgot to put the heel on the back of the Shoe! They slide off your foot and are very uncomfortable to try to keep on your feet. Won't be buying these again and I can't return them.  Guess someone will get a new pair of shoes!,0
"This is a very attractive and well-made suit. I am always looking for bathing suits that are modest without being frumpy. The top and shorts provide adequate coverage without looking like an old fashioned swimdress! Even my teenage daughter approves. I got the blue and white one, which is very pretty and upbeat. I love the fact that you can adjust the fit with the tie in the back. You can also adjust the bust via the cords going down the center, to have either a lower or higher neckline. Really very pleased with this suit. I received it for free or a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased review.",1
"I bought this purple shirt to wear to the Purple Reign show in Las Vegas and am really excited about it. I love the color and I absolutely adore the back of the shirt with the crochet look. I will probably wear a pendant necklace with it, as the higher neckline allows for a pretty chain to be worn. I plan on wearing the shirt with jeans, as the show is at night. The material of the shirt is good quality and the color of a light purple with a pinkish tint to it. The picture makes it look pink, but it is definitely purple. I would call it a cool tone, which is good for my complexion and will highlight my tan. I ordered an XL based on other reviews saying it was somewhat short waisted. I usually wear a large and sometimes a medium. I am 5'7 and 160 lbs with a long torso and the shirt fits me well. I would have been able to wear a large, but I prefer a little bit looser fit. My chest area is about 38 inches around. I like the length of sleeves which are not super short or too long.

I am reviewing this product after receiving it at a discounted price from the seller. I agree to provide and honest and unbiased review. If you look at my profile I provide reviews for almost all of my Amazon purchases in order to help others determine how products match up to their expectations.

"Let me start off by saying that I live in an area that is a hotbed for insects of all kinds.  I live near a lake... Hello Mosquitos! I also have a large rock wall in my backyard... Spiders Delight!  We have tons of flies as I think everyone probably enjoys around spring and summer time.  We also occasionally enjoy a rodent guest, although our cat usually deters that part of the population.

So now let's look at this electronic pest repeller and discuss it's effectiveness.  I have only had the item plugged in for just over a day, however I like to write a speedy review if at all possible.  I will update if anything in my review changes.  My only negative comment, I wish it covered more area.  It does cover quite a bit for me as I have a home with an open floor plan, but it's a bit expensive to have to buy multiple in order to get the entire house covered.  I don't see any other that really takes care of that issue though, and in the long run it's cheaper than hiring a pest control place yearly.

My kids go in and out of the house frequently and apparently at some point in their lives have been raised in a barn.  They often forget to close the door behind them.  Or maybe it's just that it would take ""Sooooo much effort (insert sassy child eye roll)"" from them to come in/go out of the house fully and close the doors completely behind them instead of standing in the open door way bellowing for their sibling of choice.  I haven't noticed nearly as many flies in the house since plugging this beauty in.  I did turn all the switches to on as the packaging suggests.  I haven't seen any spiders or mosquitoes in the house since plugging it in either.  I can't attest to bacteria as I can't see it, but it would be amazing if it would keep the mildew out of the air as I am so allergic!

Now it does say that if you have a minimal mouse problem it can take 16-20 days to rid of that.  I currently do not have a mouse problem as we usually only start seeing them attempting to enter the house in the fall and winter.  By that time I will have had this plugged in for far more than 20 days.

There are 4 lights on the front to indicate that the separate functions are indeed on.  The red and green blink while the blue and orange stay on full time (the picture of the unit plugged in was taken while all 4 lights were on).  The lights are not exceedingly bright, which I find to be a plus.  The 4 separate functions are high intensity ultrasonic pest repelling, negative ion, 03 cleanse, and electromagnetic.
The company has been amazing and they included a lot of instructions and explanations with the box.  Any question you may have should full well be answered in the box!

"This speaker is a great speaker , and it fit perfectly for my needs. I use it in my office, and the sound quality is pretty impressive.  It was very easy to pair it to my Mp3 player with Bluetooth. This speaker will not replace a full home sound system, but it deffinetly does a great job for a regular size room.  Its better than the small micro Bluetooth speaker.

The size of this speaker was pretty descent, and it as well included a remote, Aux wire, charger, and built in radio. I really like the fact that its completely wireless, and can be used virtually anywhere.  You can simply charge it, and take it to go.

"I recently purchased this product along with other plantar fasciitis protecting socks. I am extremely happy with this pair specifically for a few reasons. First, they are SUPER comfortable, not too tight so I don't get any cramps during the day. Also, i have worn them a few days and my feet are actually starting to feel much better. Im not sure what else someone would look for in a product like this, I just highlighted these things because they are truly the main points of this amazing product/feet saver.

"Replaced my old downstairs doorbell with this, and have enjoyed it so far!  I went though all the extra chimes, and they really kind of suck... so I left it with the default chime.  Plugged one in to my office downstairs and one in to my Wife's sewing room, and they work flawlessly!  Instead of the old doorbell between our rooms that we might not hear, these work amazing!  The only thing I don't like is the fact the remote uses one of those little fatty alkaline batteries instead of a button battery, so we will see how winter treats the remote, but a button battery would have been WAY better design.  I have never replaced the battery in the old one, and it is easily 6-7 years old, doubtful the alkaline will hold up that long, but who knows!",0

"These shoes are really cute. They seem to be very versatile and I think once they fit my daughter that she will probably wear them all summer. I was really confused with the sizing and ordered a pair that are way to big for my daughter right now. But they look to be well made and the soles are nice and flexible. I can tell by looking at them and checking out the mesh on the sides that they will be very cool to wear, I think they will definitely come in handy for playing in the water in places where my daughter needs to wear shoes. I would of rated these five stars if I would of got the right size, I only rated four stars because the sizing was so confusing to me. I would recommend these to anyone looking for cool, water shoes for the summer.

"I don't know if the best speed jump rope but the best i have seen or used, i don't have much experience on speed jump ropes, I have use some before but never a professional grade.
I bought this mainly for my 8 yrs old daughter who is 4 ft 8 in. she loved it, can be adjusted to her height so she could perform better, she was using traditional jump ropes and it was very frustrating for her only to be able to do a few jumps due to the long length of the ropes that are available at her training site.
the use of this rope is very efficient and effective, no tangles, height adjustable, barely any weight and what it seems to be very durable material.
also it does come with pouch to store it which is very handy for her to take along with her sparring gear.
I am very happy and impress with this rope.
Cons: this I consider a con for the seller and not for me as I don't think i will needing another jump in a long time as this will be adjustable to her growing needs and I expect to last her for very long time. if I ever need another one this will be the rope that I will be getting, who knows maybe she will misplace it and then i will have to buy her another.

I purchase this card again for the other one got washed and eaten in the dryer. I love three-quarter-length sweaters I'd have a hard time finding a good fit. It does not pull over my chest but it is snug in my arms. The sweater does not have much stretch but is made of good quality.

"I just love this simple wave 17 ounce insulated bottle. I purchased it and in one of my favorite colors, too. This bottle comes in many color choices.
 It really keeps your drink cold or hot most of the day. I added ice and water, and it was still cold when I finished it about 5 hours later. When I added hot tea, it kept it hot for at least six hours. I thought this was super especially since I had to finish my drinks slowly.
I should have put ice water in it and let it stand for all day, but in Tucson it really gets hot in July and I drank it. My tea was great at staying hot because I was so busy I couldn't drink it down right away, but it was still hot for me sometime during the afternoon for a tea time.
What makes this work so well? The double-walled exterior with a vacuum between them doesn't permit the heat or cold to pass through any medium. The bottle also won't sweat from condensation build up or get hot to the touch because of this technology.
 I received this insulated wave water bottle for free for my review, however, my opinion is my own and unbiased.",1
"*** Honest review from sample tester ***

It's made of cheap plastic. Technically, it's a piece of plastic with a shiny, reflective layer on it. If you want to use as a decoration of your garden, you might be disappointed a little bit.

I use it to decorate my front yard tree because I draw something on it to make it nicer. However, the retail price is ok when the most expensive is the hook, not the plastic.",1
"In short: an extraordinarily well-made journal casing with a very interesting replaceable paper stock.

The leather journal itself is a solid size, large enough to be useful while not becoming ungainly.  The leather is soft and flexible, and allows for quite a bit of rough treatment without showing any wear and tear.  The cover's design is extremely straightforward, with the paper book slipping into internal sleeves on either side of the jacket.  It should be possible to refill the journal with multiple kinds of inserts, but honestly the paper is most fascinating part of this particular item.

It appears to be a composited paper, with a nice ""old"" feel as though you are writing in a book made a very long time ago.  The paper itself has an uneven mulch-like grain that's soft to the touch, and both pens and pencils make nice, easy markings that indent nicely without going too deep and causing raised indentations on the reverse side.  (I've tried to capture these qualities in the attached pictures.)  The binding is a surprising combination of flexible and durable, giving me the ability to fold pages out firmly without cracking the binding.  It also doesn't snap shut when released.  All in all it's fun to write in, and I'll be definitely be refilling with the same paper.  The outside of the refills are also an interesting pattern, and I think it will also look quite nice to label the spine of a completed insert and put it on a shelf by itself.

"Talk about a compact, heavy duty charging machine! The Eoso 10000mah Ultra Slim portable charger exceeded my expectations right out of the box. It comes with just about everything you need to operate it and mine actually came fully charged which was nice.

It has two attached cords, one is a usb which is great if you're charging a laptop. The other is micro usb which works well if you use an android product. Then it has two USB ports meaning you can charge multiple devices assuming you have the cables. Then finally it has a port to charge it which is also usb so you can either charge it with a computer or using a wall charger however that doesn't come with the product. A cool surprise as a small usb lamp that came along with it, I wasn't aware it was included and is a nice little bonus.

The casing is sleek and sturdy. It's easy to tell how charged it is with the 4 LED lights, all four lit up means it is fully charged and they go out according to the charge. I'm not sure how long it takes to fully charge but I imagine if you plug it in the night before you use it then you'll be set.

This gets 5-stars and I'm not even aware of its durability yet but the quality is so good I can imagine it will last quite some time.

"Organization is a big thing for me so anything that helps me stay organized is fantastic. I have found this weekly calendar super helpful in helping me plan an upcoming vacation. The calendar displays a full week starting with Sunday. Each day is separated with boxes that are large enough to write a great deal. I have been using a dry erase marker and it has held up well. The calendar is very easy to clean. However, I have found that sometimes the print leaves a mark on the surface leaving a slight shadow of what was previously written. When this occurs, I just press a bit harder against the calendar and use a damp cloth and it has come off. The calendar has been a great aid in keeping my plans visible and organized!

"This hat is adorable! I purchased the black hat with the beads. I am a Disney fanatic and as soon as I saw the photo of this hat, the pearl beads screamed MICKEY MOUSE to me! But not in a tacky way at all. I think only Disney fans would even think this. I purchased this hat for Derby day but plan to wear it more often! It is wool so not for summer months, but not overly warm so I don't have to wait for winter either. It definitely has a cute vintage feel and I think it would look cute with a dress or top with a matching cardigan over it.

The bag the hat comes in is very nice as well and I will use it whenever the hat is not being worn as this will keep pet fur and dust from the hat. I also like that the hat is quite fold-able so I will be able to take it on trips with me.

I recommend this hat that can be worn for any occasion! I received this item at a discounted rate for my honest review.",1

"I've been reviewing a number of Bluetooth headphones as it is really hard to get a good one in the under $100 range. They are either ok sounding, uncomfortable, bad battery life, and useless on phone calls!

This one pretty much gets high marks on all a headphone like this is meant to do!  Great sound, easy to use, love the retracting cables, nice color, foldable or keep it hanging on your neck, etc.

First the setup:
Bluetooth function: super easy to pair! Find it on your Bluetooth screen, select, and you are in business!

Next the performance with music:
Put my phone in one end of the house, walked at least 30 feet away, and sound was still very clear through at least 3 walls.
Sound is REALLY good! I mean, really really good! EDM, Bossa Nova, guitar instrumentals, rap, techno, disco, etc. At first it was bass heavy, which I was ok with. After reading the direction (yes, duh, read the manual), I found out that there are some cool features like even changing the eq. Double-click the ""-"" button and you can go from bass-enhanced, normal, and treble enhanced. These eq's (even though a little limited, definitely improve the listening experience. You can also adjust your eq on your phone to get it to your perfect setting.

Now for the part I don't use most since I am more or using this for music... The phone calls! These are super clear, both from the caller end and the receiving end! REALLY clear! My wife couldn't tell the difference then I was using it and when I was using just my regular phone. I even left a voicemail at my work phone and both sounded the same to me. This was the most impressive piece for me since I rarely use these headsets for phone calls as it tends to be ""hit-or-miss"". Now I am definitely using these for those long conference calls.

These are one of the few, actually the only one in the sub $50 that I would recommend! I wish there was a case or pouch but that is just me.

I received this item at a discount to provide an honest review. My views are my own and I only review items I will be using regularly. I listen to music regularly during my train commute to work and this will be coming with me from now on. Now that the phone calls are high quality, I will not have to remove when I get a phone call to keeps things really hands free.",1
"Great case for Samsung Galaxy s7 edge. The case comes nicely packaged and is actually two separate components. The hard outer cover and the soft, flexible inner cover that hugs my s7 edge. The two combined make this a great option for a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge phone case. The power button and volume buttons are covered so I did have to push a little harder to get the buttons to work, but not much. Happens with other cases I have tried. The other ports all align perfectly and I can charge my phone and use headphones without any issues. The case is comfortable but slightly slippery when touching the softer inner case. The contrast of colors is a nice touch. I love the Teal and gray. The colors are bright and make my phone easy to locate. Overall I am very happy with this product.

I hope you have found this review helpful to you. I had the opportunity to purchase this product at a discount or for free in return for my honest and unbiased opinion. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and I receive no incentives or rewards. This item was used and tested before I reviewed it. My comments are sincere and are my own opinion.",1
This screen protector is the best one i have bought so far. it is really easy to install and it also comes with everything you might need just in case something happens and you mess up. It also is really scratch resistant i have had it in my pocket and all the other screen protectors always got scratched while having them in my pocket but this one is hasent so far.,0
"This outdoor clock looks better in person than in the picture. This clock is simply beautiful. It is a little larger than I expected, but I hung it in a new outdoor pavilion just added to my home and it was the perfect size for the space I intended. The numbers are a large size that allows you to easily visualize the time from just about anywhere around the area outdoors. It has a very elegant look to it, but could also fit equally well in many other styles of decor. It came packaged extremely well. It was very easy to unscrew screws from the back of the packaging that held it securely in place during shipping, take the cover off of the back and install a AA battery, set the time and hang it up. It has a very sturdy area on the back to hang it from. Overall, it seems to be a very sturdy, durable and ornate clock. I would recommend this clock without any hesitation whatsoever. I received this product at promotional price in return of my honest unbiased review - this is my honest review after extensively using the product. Would recommend regardless. Let me know if this review helped you!",1
"* I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. *

I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't this.  The quality of these is WAAAAY better than the one I have, or any of the others that I've ever owned and being married 31 years, I've owned a bunch.  The only one that ever came sort of close was a ceramic one, but it had a cheap, acrylic handle.  These look and feel professional.

They are solid, weighty, and fit well in my hand.  The silicone grip on one side is convenient to keep it from slipping when dealing with fruits and vegetables that get slippery in the process of peeling.  There is a slight point on the end for gouging out potato eyes or bad spots, which is a convenience, and a must for me.

The photo for these has them at an angle that made me expect to receive two peelers of different sizes, but they're both the same size.

They came in a little box, with each in its own little plastic sleeve, which I think makes them great for gifting and easy to wrap.

I whipped these out today to peel carrots for a carrot cheesecake cake.  Peeling carrots was effortless.  I peeled a potato just to see, and it was a breeze also.  My adult children covet them, which tells me these would be an appreciated gift for weddings, housewarmings, and a variety of other things.",1

"I am a flip flop sandal fanatic so I was excited to try these out! Even-though they are ""boys"" sandals, I liked the casual look/comfort and was looking for something lightweight that I could casually wear anytime but also don't hurt my feet! These are so comfortable! The top has soft comfy foam/plastic/rubber feel that has raised areas (isn't just flat like typical sandals) and provides cushion for my feet when walking. The strap is also equally comfortable as well as loose so it doesn't cut into my foot or feel uncomfortable in any way. Even after wearing them all day. With them being so lightweight, I strap them onto my backpack so I can use them anytime my feet get tired, it's great!
I ordered this item and received it at a discounted rate for testing and providing my honest, unbiased opinion; which I have given to assist other buyers in making informed buying decisions. I expect honest reviews when I purchase products online so I will only provide the same.",1
"I really do like this thin womens zip up hoodie. It is the perfect weight for when I want something to help take the chill off yet its still warm out. My daughters soccer games are next to the lake and it is usually 10 degrees colder. When evening sets in you sometimes need a little something. This has a hood if you wanted to protect your ears. It is slightly fitted. The arms fit a bit snug but i have pretty muscular arms compared to other women. My daughter wants to use this as her warm up jacket for her sports.

"I was looking for a very light hydration pack that I could take on backpacking trips to use on days when we're day-hiking from a base camp. So, I specifically wanted something very minimal that would not add much weight to my backpack--my regular daypack is way too heavy to add on to a loaded backpack. This pack only weighs about 10.5 oz, and the weight of the bladder and tube doesn't really count since I'm carrying one for my main pack anyway.
Other light packs that I looked at held only a 1.5-liter bladder (the ErgaLogik holds a standard 2-l size) or were designed only for runners and lacked any space for snacks and such. The ErgaLogik Gravity has a front pocket and two full-length side pockets, plenty of room for lunch, snacks, maps, GPS, sunscreen or whatever you carry. It also has stretch-cord to hold trekking poles or a jacket. AND, it cost me $30, less than half the price of a comparably light Major Brand pack I considered.
For the record, I was NOT paid for this review, and I did NOT receive free or discounted products as incentive to write it.",1
"This knife is made by tak force, which my husband was very happy to see. The knife is good quality and I just love the wooden accents. When I placed my order the seller offered free engraving, which I took advantage of. It made a really nice personal gift for my husband which he loved by the way. I would purchase this item again. This also arrived before the estimated shipping date which was a huge surprise because of the personalization.

"Super cute necklace.  Seems to be of high quality for costume jewelry.  The stones and metal are shiny and have a good sparkle.  It would be nice if there was the option to purchase multiple of the same color stones so that you could have more then 1 birthday in the same month.  It is a nice size and is large enough to stand out with out being overbearing.  The stones around the outside of the circle give it a little more bling.

I ordered this to go with my mother of the bride evening gown for my daughters wedding in November. I was looking for a gold evening purse and did not want to spend a lot. The price was perfect and the purse matches my dress as well. Can! t wait to use it. Does not look cheap. I also like the fact that I have 2 options for the strap.,0
"I got these for my teenage daughter and she really, really likes them! She said they are very comfortable, but supportive at the same time.

I purchased this so that I could use it as a Network Drive with my PC. After contacting SanDisk support they have told me that you cannot connect a PC to a WiFi network and the SanDisk Wireless Connect Drive at the same time... This is possible with Android but not on a PC. VERY Disappointing..!,0

"I bought these shoes after purchasing sandals and flip flops from Vionic.  I have plantar fasciitis and I do not have to wear inserts with these.  The support is built in and very comfortable.

I found these ran a half size smaller than what I had been purchasing from Nike and New Balance.  These fit perfect in an 8 1/2.

Normally after being on my feet for several hours I would get minor swelling, but I have not had this issue since I've been wearing these.  These have a high arch support and a deep heel cup that is a perfect match to my feet!",0
"First of all, when you open the Amazon box  you see another box.  This umbrella comes presented in a black box instead of the usual plastic case.  That, in and of itself makes it a nice practical gift choice for someone who appreciates a well-made attractive umbrella.  The Umbrella snaps open and it expands with immediacy and force.  Right away it becomes obvious that this umbrella is very strong.  (much nicer than the flimsy thin ones I have owned and thrown)  It is very easy to collapse and re-wrap.  I have the blue one and its very pretty.  I forgot to mention that after you take the umbrella out of the box, you see a business card.  On one side, it says thank you (very pretty wreath), the other side thanks you for trust and support  it goes on to say if there are any issues to contact them and they will  handle any problems properly to your satisfaction.  It says more  its very nice  and its classy.  Most business cards are made of stock and are fairly flimsy  this card is a reflection of the quality of their product.

This is my car umbrella now.  It fits anywhere so right now, because we are expecting some rain this week, its on my console right beside me.

I was not expecting to like it as much as I do.

"I purchased the Junior Kids Swim Goggles by POQ in blue and when they arrived, they were in a sleek, clear plastic case that latched on the side.  They are easily adjustable, and my 14 year old daughter had them fitting her head in less than a minute.  They can be adjusted by tightening the straps, but on the particular pair we selected, the nose bridge was not able to be adjusted. This wasn't a problem, just an observation.  This means she will be able to use these for many years. They are made of a rubber material that seems pretty durable.  When she went under water in our pool, they definitely kept water out of her eyes, which is a huge plus!  Included with the goggles is some information, including information about proper fitting, proper removal, some warnings of things to NOT do with the goggles, hot to care for your goggles, and how to adjust the head strap.  I might just have to purchase another pair of these!  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review. I was not paid to review this product.",1
"The Maxboost screen protector came with detailed instructions and supplies to install it for flawless results.

"I purchased this pest repeller to help with the ants and flies that we seem to constantly have in the house.  We have three kids who always leave some kind of crumb or leftover something on our floor which attracts the ants.  In addition to that, the kids are always running in and out of the house and bringing in what feels like every fly in the neighborhood.  Ever since plugging in this pest repeller our insect issue has dramatically decreased! The best part is that we did have to spray any harsh chemicals or put out any traps that my toddler wants to mess with.  We are super please with this purchase.

"We had a presto for 12 years. The surface was getting worn. We tried an Osteo Ceramic surface griddle with a warming tray which was well made,looked nice but had terrible heat control. The parent company Jarden was nice and sent us a free Replacement.  It had the same problems. Overcooked bacon,burned eggs and overdone pancakes. The On Off temperature variation was over a hundred degrees. They took back the second one and I returned the first one and got my money back.  We purchased a Presto 07030 griddle and it is just the same as our old one except the surface is new.. Much better temp control than the Osteo. Eggs slide around on their non stick surface. Only complaint is, it would be nice if it had nonslip feet instead of just plastic. Slides around on the counter too easily. I found some Vinyl adhesive pads that work. Possibly the stick on pads will not last long but they were cheap. Love it.",1
"This flashlight is of a size of a finger. It measures only 2.5'' long and about 0.5'' wide. It weights 1 oz, its featherlight. This is exactly what I needed to attach to my safety vest`s interior`s pocket to take boating. You will need one AAA battery in order to use it, that does not come included, so stack up. Its bright and powerful, especially for such a small device. It appears very well made and can be attach to anything I ordered the black version and it looks good. It can also be attached to something as a pen would be.

It probably would not replace a regular sized flashlight, because its light source is more direct and because of the size not as wide, but its an awesome emergency flash light, that will be seen from far away. You won't even notice having in your pocket when camping or hiking. I plan on always having it with me while doing outdoor activities, in case I stuck somewhere after the dark. I was actually in the market for product like this one and I would have bought it.

"We have a young dog that likes to eat headsets and headphones I got these for my daughter to replace a previous set. Since headphones in our house are always at risk, it is nice to find a pair with a reasonable price point. I got the headphones in red and black, the red is very pretty and the outside of the headphones is a shiny slick black. The 3.5 gold plated jack plugged into my Samsung phone perfectly and also my laptop. My daughter likes to watch videos and play games on the laptop while I watch tv. I tested the headphones while the tv was on. I was listening to music and I couldn't hear the tv at all once I got the headphones positioned properly. The headphone band folds up into a fairly compact package and it is adjustable so you can get them placed over your ears just right. There is an in-line mic that you click the button to answer the phone or hang up and also to pause/play music. The music sounded pretty rich and not tinny at all. I think these are decent headphones and they will definitely be well-used in my house. I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased opinion and review.",1
"My daughter LOVES Magic Town, and loved this new addition to her collection.  It's a cute little leotard/skirt combo that every little girl will fall head over heels for.

"We purchased this for our 9 year old 80 pound dog who we are thinking of renaming "" Houdini"".We have tried choke chains and harnesses but she always finds a way to slip them and run. She is awful around other dogs and im concerned for the safety of other dogs as well as my own. She constantly escapes from her lead in our back yard. Harness and all won't stop her so we hoped this would help us control her wandering and it sure did.

The box contains transmitter remote, reciever collar( collar is waterproof and adjustable) and charger. One charger charges both remote and collar . Owners manual which clearly explains everything, Testing bulb kit and 2 sets of metal contact points are included as well. Everything you need is in this box to start training your dog.

I love that it has 3 settings, sound, vibration and shock and I can control it all from a remote . I cant always be outside  when the dog is and her lead is about 300 feet from the house. The remote had no trouble working fine at that distance. I have used sound and vibration. These features  seems to stop her very well  I have not tried the shock feature yet and Hoping i don't have to. She is listening better and when she does escape, a touch of a button stops her . I love that I don't have to worry about her sprinting off before i can get to her. We live near a busy road so its important for me to keep her safe.

"UPDATE 3: So, the new ones were great until the 2-3 month mark. If that's how long you need a charger for, then go for it! But if you want something that lasts steer clear... I wanted to love them but I feel I can't trust them. Sorry guys!

UPDATE 2: I was sent replacement cables after mentioning mine broke. I am very happy with their quick customer service and glad they have remedied the issue - I received the cables a day after they offered a replacement. Since their customer service is so good I have updated the rating to 3 stars - I will report back about a month from now, and if they are still good, I will raise the rating further. The ones I received this time are slightly different in color - the metal is a deep blue rather than a sky blue. They do feel quite sturdy.

UPDATE 1: Okay, just kidding, these are just as bad as the ones I had previously. Both the micro USBs have died and it hasn't even been 2 months yet. Would not buy again.

I was a bit skeptical about purchasing more micro USB cables on Amazon since I recently bought some similar ones and the micro USB part broke on 2 of the 3 cords within 2 months. However, I decided to give these a try anyways. It was worth the gamble so far! The cords are thicker and more sturdy than the ones I had bought previously. They also have reinforcement at the base of the micro USB and the beginning of the wire. Another problem I had with my old cords was that they bent at the cord since I rested it on my stomach while browsing on my phone. That has not happened with these. The cord is sturdy and the reinforcement really does help. I have only had them for a week, so if they begin to act up I will update. But I have a good feeling about these. :) Thanks a bunch!

So far my dogs like these bones. I like that they are made in the USA and don't contain MSG. My one issue (as someone who used to work in the pet product industry) is that I can't find any sizing information listed on the package.

"I am not the thinnest woman in the world and as a woman, I'm not 100% confident in my body. With that said, I was a bit skeptical about giving this dress a try. I mean, it's a form fitting ""pencil"" dress which is terrifying when you don't have the perfect body. Dresses like these are known for hugging the wrong parts of your body. This one, however, is much different.

I'm not sure if it's the design or the fit or a combination of both, but this dress made me feel SO confident! I literally said, ""WOW"" when I looked in the mirror. It's sexy and classy. You could wear this to a formal event, business meeting, or a night out with the girls! It isn't too tight or too short. It has a sexy slit in the back, which I think adds character. The material isn't too thick. I walked around outside in California weather in this dress without breaking a sweat.

I wear a 36DD bra, size 7 (US) jeans, and I'm 5'0, if that helps!

PS. I wore this dress to a press event where I interviewed celebrities for the Tarzan movie and got a TON of compliments on my dress!

I definitely recommend this dress! I want it in every design now!

"I was looking for an armband I could use while running and working out and thought I would try this one out.  I have the samsung galaxy s6 and the phone fits in just fine.  It does have a camera cut out which would be next to your arm which I thought was weird.  I mean if you are going to take a picture you are going to take your phone out in the first place.  The camera cutout is for an iphone.  The arm band fits snug on your arm and will fit just about anybody.  What was cool about this arm band is that it has the spot for your house key.  I have never really thought about having that on my arm, but it really does make sense to have it there as well.  It is really easy today and holds your phone well so you don't have to worry about it falling out.  The plastic covering doesn't change the image and you can still see what is going on through it.  The screen is transparent like the image shows.

I have received this product at a discount for my complete and honest review.  I have in no way changed my outlook of the product to make it better than what it is.

This is a women's small compact wallet.  It is very well made.  It actually looked better in person in my opinion.  It looks more high quality than the picture presents.  It as storage for credit cards and IDs.  It also has a place to put paper money.  It is limited in size and the money has to be folded.  It has a different zipper area with two areas to put change or small items.  This would be great for anyone wanting  to carry a small purse. This would fit great in a small purse.

The actual flashlight is only about 2.5"" long and is powered by 1 AAA battery (not included). The battery gets inserted by unscrewing the head of the light. However, as others have mentioned, the twisting/untwisting of the light's head also functions as the ""On/Off"" mechanism. I'm not a big fan of this particular design, and loosening the head (to turn it to the ""On"" position) in order to use the light seemed rather counter intuitive to me. In my experience, flashlights with a twist-type power mechanism usually have a solid endpoint when the flashlight is both on and off. For this light, you essentially  have to ""guess"" (for lack of a better term) the degree to which to turn the head in order to both ensure that the light is firmly on and won't flicker, while also making sure not to turn it too far as to make the head loose enough to potentially fall off during use. The other issue with this mechanism that I came to realize after carrying this light on my key chain for a few days is that even in the ""Off"" position, if you apply just slight  pressure to the light's head, the light will also illuminate. This was not only annoying/distracting, but also creates the potential for a shorter battery life (ie, if my keys were buried at the bottom of my purse as they often are, the light may be on for hours at a time without knowing it).

With that being said, this light does have several positive features. When clipped to my key chain, I didn't even notice the fact that it was there because of its impressively small size and light weight (I think the AAA battery may actually weigh more than the flashlight itself). After inserting the battery, I was more than impressed by the incredible bright light that such a tiny little tool could project. If I were out hiking/camping at dusk (or digging through the dark mess of my car trunk), this would certainly be the type of bright light that I would want with me. Also, as mentioned earlier, it is convenient to carry either by the pocket clip or lobster claw key chain clasp. Overall, I do think this is a great mini flashlight despite a few quirks in its design.

"I can't begin to tell you how many houseplants I've murdered in my life, mostly from overwatering.  Ugh!  I found the Jellas Moisture Sensor Meter, Indoor / Outdoor Soil Water Monitor, Humidity Plant Care Hygrometer for Gardening, Farming and hopefully this hygrometer will prevent more houseplants from senselessly dying.

This cool tool measures the moisture level of a plant at root level, which is where drowning occurs.  It's very easy to use.  You just insert the probe into the soil, and the sensitive dial will tell you how dry or wet the soil is, even at the bottom of the pot, and you can tell if it's needing water or not, EVEN if the top of the soil feels dry.  It takes no batteries to operate, and it's accurate.  When you're done checking on your plant friends, simply remove the probe and wipe it clean to store.

The package even comes with a handy list of common houseplants and their watering needs.  I don't recognize many of the names, but I did find a few familiar ones.  It's really simple, though, to research how dry your plant needs to be between waterings, and to only water when the hygrometer shows you that the soil is at that level.

I can't wait to try this on our houseplants, our potted garden, and our greenhouse plants.  It should also be useful when we're starting seeds indoors, when they're most at risk of rot.

I received a discount on the Moisture Sensor Meter in return for my honest review.  Plants worldwide are rejoicing.  Thanks for reading!",1
I purchased this ring for my husband. Because of his profession he is not able to wear his gold ring and i have been on the look out for a high quality ring that he would wear that would stand up to the noramal wear and tear that he would put it through on a daily basis. We have had this ring for a few weeks now amd so far it has withstood all of the things that he has put it through amd it still looks like it did the day we got it! I am very impressed.

"I absolutely love this feeder!  I have become a bit of a back yard bird enthusiast recently as we moved to a new house and the back yard lends itself to the hobby.  I had an older antique looking feeder I was using, but it wasn't red and the birds just weren't really interested in it.  The hummingbirds were coming to eat from the day lilies in our yard, so I knew they were around.  I saw this red feeder and decided to try it out.  I love the look of it!  It is incredibly beautiful.  The bright red globe is thick and strong, so even though it is glass it does not seem particularly fragile.  The color is a deep and lovely red.  I love the little posts for the birds to land on and I've already seen 2-3 birds at it resting and eating in just a short time! I hope they tell their friends!  I would absolutely buy from Grateful Gnome again.  The item was packaged perfectly in a nice box and was well protected during shipping.  I am thinking about getting a second feeder for another tree in our yard.  I cannot recommend this enough!

Very easy to understand and read all measurements are on there to make whatever pastry perfect in size ..taking guesswork out of how it will come out and look. A baker delight!

"This shirt arrived on time and was packaged well. It arrived in new condition with tags. I chose the blue colored shirt and it is pretty true to the color in the listing's photos. It might be just a slightly darker shade of blue, but it is a really pretty color. The first thing I noticed about thw shirt was how soft it is! It is a polyester and cotton blend and super comfortable. The material is very breathable but not thin. The seams are sewn well and even. The letters across the front of the shirt are solid and not peeling.
I normally wear a size 8-10 or a large shirt. I ordered the large and find it pretty true to size. It is just a little shorter than I like my shirts, but not short enough to make it not fit or cover everything ;) The material is stretchy and has a flattering fit, a little wider on the bottom. I did not notice any shrinkage after washing, but I let it air dry. I did not want it to get any shorter in length.

"This bag is fairly large and can hold a bit of stuff for a long weekend.  I really like the large oppening for the main compartment which allows easy access for getting things in and out of the bag.  The inside has a large compartment for a laptop or tablet and is well cushioned on front and back.  The laptop compartment is also raised from the botton of the bag by a few inches so a drop is cushioned by that space. There's a drawstring that can quickly close the main compartment along with a large flap that securely protect your stuff from the element with two magnetic clips that is made to look like buckles.  The smaller compartment on the front is also handy for smaller items and has a zipper along with a flap.  This bag feels very durable with the heavy nylon fabric.  I like the construction of the bag as well as the padding for the shoulder straps and the back support.  My only negative review about this bag are the black and white straps that rungs down the bag.  I thought they were nylon or some kind of fabric but it turns out that they are made of a durable rubber which seems fine but I would have prefered some heavy duty fabric like the rest of the bag.  I highly doubt this makes the bags any less durable.  Overall, the backpack is very useful and practical for a long road trip.  This backpack was provided at a discount for my honest review.",1

"I got this solar charger for my brother who loves to travel a lot. I got it for him because he just finished going to school to be a tour director and I thought this would be a good item for him to have. He really loves. it works great and charges relatively fast for what it is. We haven't used it as the solar charger yet but we have used it with the charging cord and it works nicely. Our favorite thing about this is that it can be charged by solar power so if there is a power outage or when camping or in a emergency we can charge our phones and other devices. This is a great charger and I would buy it again.
I love reading Amazon reviews and always read them when I'm thinking of getting a product, it doesn't matter if I'm buying from Amazon or not. I look at reviews for everything.

"This bowl and stand feeder keeps it nice and simple, which is just the way I like it...I have two cats, but only one can really feed at a time no matter how big the bowl is.  In the past I have had the tendency to put bigger bowls of food and water down for its saves time.  But I still tried to change the water daily which led to a lot of waste.  These bowls are considerably smaller than what I was using, but the water lasts at least a day, and there is much less waste.  Also, the food dish is perfect for my two cats.  I fill it about every other day.  The small size is actually perfect for me for my home is small and space is at a premium.  No back room or entrance way here for the food dishes, just the corner of the kitchen floor.  Not only does it fit well but it looks much better than just random bowls of what not...As for the quality of this, it will last forever less you drop one and it breaks, or you accidentally step on it and mash it out of shape.  The bowls are not thin at all but thick with a fine quality to them.  All around I find these excellent for both the quality; looks, and the price they are asking.  Highly recommended...

"My wife and I both recently got Fitbit Charge HRs and are loving them.  The one thing about the stock charging cables that came with them is that they are so short.  I found these so we not only could have some normal length charging cables, but also so we could keep the stock ones as back ups in case any of them ever stopped working or we lost one, or whatever might happen.  So far, they have been doing just as good a job of charging the Fitbits (meaning it takes pretty much the same time to fully charge them as the stock cables).  The only thing is that plugging the cable into the Fitbit proves to be a little more difficult, due to the fact I think they are just a little too tight.  However, despite being more difficult to plugin and remove, it's also nice that when it gets bumped while being plugged in now, the cable doesn't detach (which I noticed was an issue on both of ours with the stock cable).  Overall, I'm very pleased I found these and I would recommend them to anyone with a Charge HR, whether you're looking for a replacement cable, or to find a longer cable, or just to have a back up.

"I had been looking for a while for some kind of shelf/rack/organizer that would hold all of my kitchenaid mixer attachments. I have pretty shallow kitchen drawers that don't hold a lot, especially the big whisk! This organizer holds them all pretty conveniently. It also has room to store some more stuff too, which is a bonus to me.

The hooks slide so you can put them where you want them. The two ""cup holder"" looking things come out too so you can use them to hold things when eating outdoors. They're also easy to clean.

The only problem is that it was pretty difficult to hang up. My fianc did it and did not have the easiest time. Also, he didn't think it would hold much weight, much less hold itself, with the equipment it came with to hang up. But, he was wrong and it is sturdy! It has done a good job of holding my kitchen tools. I received this rack as a sample for evaluation and review.",1

"The corset is very cute! It is well made and fits me nicely. The material is very soft. It is easy to figure out how to get on if you haven't worn them before. The one thing that I dislike is the fact that the string in the back is sooo long. I guess that is to make up for different sized women. The point in a corset is to tighten it as much as you like and with that I have way too much string left over. The g-string that comes with it is not the right size for me, any bottoms I get have to be a different size than the top. Otherwise its beautiful and fits nice. I received this product at a discount for my fair and unbiased review.",1
"I purchased these at my local Best Buy store because I was impatient and didn't want to wait 2 days (thanks price match). Overall I am pretty impressed.

I wanted an over ear headset over my in ear headset because they were really quiet and just not as good as I wanted. I picked these up and I was paired within 10 seconds of taking them out of the box, the NFC is a really nice feature.

They sound great; 30mm drivers aren't as good as it gets, but for this price it is well worth it.

They fit snugly on your head and don't fall off during movement. They might get a little uncomfortable with extended wear, but I don't plan on using these for more than an hour at a time. The buttons are very easy to reach and respond well. I have not and probably won't ever test the mic.

The build quality isn't all that great, but for the price it's still well worth it.

I definitely recommend these to anybody looking for a bluetooth headset under 100$.",0

"The first thing I noticed about my set of stools is that they are tiny! I guess I expected something bigger since the weight limit for the larger one is 200 lbs. That said, they do hold the weight recommended. The construction is nice and strong. The stools fold and unfold in a snap. The colors are nice and bright too. Do not think you can sit on them unless you are tiny. I have decided to give my set of camping stools to my nephews. They will have a blast with them and they are young. My husband doesn't feel they are of a size to be useful to him.

"I was provided this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. This arrived 1-day before I left on a 2 week vacation to wet, cold Alaska. Having a waterproof bag that could hold jackets, sweatshirts and the like was really important to enjoying the vacation more.

+ Great amount of room in this bag. 40L!!

+ But that's not all...you can unzip underneath and the bag becomes longer, so you can stuff more liters of items into it. Wow. I've tested out 30+ bags in the last year and none have expansion like this one.

+ Green looks nice and masculine, but truth be told it's a backpack and the green could be neutral colored too.

+ Solid stitching that doesn't look like it's going to come undone anytime soon.

+ Lots of straps for added items on this backpack. The rear straps are perfect for a small sleeping bag or sleeping mat to be slid between them and then the straps cinched tight to carry it.

+ In the picture I have a 15-inch Dell laptop in here. As you can see there is PLENTY of room for a larger laptop...or two. Thus no issues with having the space to carry my devices or take them on a trip with me.

+ Nice addition of the audio cable port for one's headphones.

+ A great amount of padding between the bag on one's back. Also, since the padding is nice and thick, it helps encourage airflow, which is nice in keeping things cooler.

+ Typically the larger the backpack the more you pay. But at the time of this writing, $37 for a HUGE bag that is waterpoof/resistant is lower on the price range. This is great for customers.

OVERALL: I cannot think of anything I would improve on this bag. Because it is so large, my next trip, this one is going with me...again.",1
"Basic!!! I am addicted to the water and shopping, which is why I own a ridiculous amount of different types of water shoes. With that being said I would like to think of myself as somewhat of an expert. I received this product at a discount for an honest review and out of respect I will not post other products, but I will definitely give my honest opinion.

These are very close to the design that we have had for decades with a few improvements. I like the top material and how it is put together. They used a comfortable mesh on the top part and I like it a lot.

The problem with these are not typically the top as much as the bottom. I think the worst thing a water shoe can have is a removable sole. Often, it will move around when you walk and sometimes even slide partially out. This moving sole is not comfortable or safe. They need to glue it or sew it in so it doesn't move. The fit is usually also too loose, no matter what size you get. When you get water in them it feels like you have ziplock bags on your feet filled with water until it finally drains out.

I understand the sole is for comfort because they make the rubber bottom thin so it can be flexible and bend in half for storing, but I don't think this is necessary. When I say this I am talking about the rubber bottom. I prefer a solid bottom, which offers more support and comfort at the same time. These types of shoes typically do not bend, but it is well worth the extra luggage space. When your climbing around sharp slippery rocks you tend to want a solid shoe you can trust.",1

Each flashlight requires 3 AAA batteries for it to operate. In the video with this review, you will see there are 3 different settings for the flashlights. There is the regular light, a dimmer light, and a strobe light. With each light setting, you can create a range of light focus from narrow to wide. In the video, I was standing 15 feet away from the wall when I recorded.

Pros:
- Light and compact. Perfect for walking, running outside. I would say it is ideal for storing in your car in case you have car issues, need to pull over,
  and want to be seen.
- 3 different light settings
- The range of light focus from narrow to wide and everything in-between
- Easy to change the light settings, just hit the button in the back.
- Seems to be put together with integrity, I am betting it will last a good amount of time.
- Batteries are easy to install
- Great price for getting 3 separate flashlights

Cons:
- The part you turn to switch the light focus seems to get stuck every now and then. But is easily fixed with an extra try.
- If you want any of the 3 light features, (normal light, dimmed light, or strobe) you have to turn the on/off button until you reach the desired light feature. It would have been nice to have a click setting that would let you stay or easily switch to another light. This is just a small complaint. But, with only 3 light features, you can quickly get to the desired one.

Overall, I would recommend buying these flashlights. I feel they are a great quality flashlight for the price being asked. I received the product at a promotional discount for my honest review.",1

This giraffe cam is a super saver and can allow you to get in places you couldn't before. Times before I could never see what kind of noise my car was making because of it being hiding behind tons of parts. Now its a breeze I just hook this cam on my phone and start to search in small places looking for the problems. I don't waste time taking of every part just to look for the cause. I just pull out this cam and start to shimmy it around. There is a built in light around the cam so you can see in dark places. Only thing I wish that it wasn't a 2 megapixel cam. But other than that this cam is beast and I recommend you buy this especially if you're a repair guy. I left a few pics so you guys can take a look at.

"I was so excited to receive this product. I drink a lot of wine and am always concerned about it going bad in a day or two when I recork left overs. This product says I don't have to worry about that so I put it to the test. The product came wonderfully packaged and individually wrapped. They also included some directions (not a lot of products do this). I popped open a bottle of wine and used the stopper.

First thing to note when doing this is to make sure you insert it completely vertically or you will not be able to get the air out of the bottle. Once the pump was inserted, I pushed the center button down a couple of times and the stop wouldn't rise again. The instructions say that means the air is all out of the bottle.

Next, I pulled off the stopper, poured a glass, and then put the stopper back on. This time I had to pump about 4 times before the top stopped rising. I also tested putting the bottle back in my wine fridge and holding it upside down. No leaks!

Final feature which was a bonus for me. There is a dial at the top that lets you select the date you opened the wine. This way, you know exactly how long it's been open instead of doing a yucky taste test. I was able to set the dial to today's date and other dates. The dial didn't move back after setting it.

I love this product. I will be buying more for friends in my wine club as gifts.

"This DVD set is great for the beginner or experienced workout trainee. Many of the exercises are done with no equipment and most can be done with bands or handheld weights. Only a few require an overhead bar. I received this set at a reduced price in exchange for my honest opinion and i really think most people can complete all the moves the trainer shows. He is not as in your face as a lot of trainers although he does seem to focus on training men more than women. This makes sense because the exercises seem more geared to men, but women can do them as well. I am over 50 and have physical disabilities, so I cannot fully do every move shown, but I can still get a lot out of this set and work toward being in better shape. They also talk about proper nutrition to maintain a healthy body. Al in all this is a very good set for training your body.",1

"We have only had this collar for a few days and at this point I am willing to give it 5 stars. If anything changes I will come back and do an update. With 4 dogs in the house you can guess the barking gets out of control  sometimes. One boy in particular  is  a constant  barker (JRT).OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS WE HAVE BOUGHT AT LEAST 4 COLLARS OR OTHER ITEMS THAT PROMISE TO DISCOURAGE NUISANCE  BARKING. We've  had a citronella spray collar, which you filled with spray cans you bought  separately.  The idea being when he barks he gets sprayed in the snout,  this annoys/distracts the dog and therefore stops  the barking,  right? WRONG  .THE  dog quickly  learned that  5 quick barks would empty the collar and then he could bark without spray.that collar was middle of the road price  wise, but then you had to buy batteries and refill spray. We tried the spray horns that make a loud noise  which all the dogs became immune to. Honestly if I  listed everything we tried you'd  be amazed we haven't  given up yet. I have to admit I was a little Leary about trying a shock collar again. We had a bad experience with one shock collar that would go off without warning or barking this would really confuse the dog so we had to stop using it. I like the bark prevention collar it seems to be working really well. It does not have an adjustment for the static shock however there is an adjustment for the sensitivity level so if the dog is barking and the collar isn't shocking you can increase the sensitivity if the dog is barking just a little and the collar is shocking you can decrease the sensitivity. We were quickly able to find the perfect level for our Jack Russell. The thing I like the very best about this collar is that it gives a warning beep and the beep is loud enough that everyone can hear it , our boy has learned when he hears the beep he will get a shock. Barking  has decreased by about 90%. This collar comes in a  small box , it has a plastic piece with the testing light so you can check if the collar is working properly the instructions are easy to understand. For the price of the collar it is definitely a good buy. I have bought collars for 3 times as much that have not worked as well. If you're looking for a collar for your dog, especially as a first time user try this one. I should include that I received this collar at a reduced price for giving an honest review.

"Inside a pretty glass vase, these artificial Red Roses look very close to the real deal. Of course, there is no rosy scent. What I like the most about the roses is they look more natural than other bouquets I had in the past.

Theses roses are great for parties, weddings or get together situation. And no need to oder fresh roses...

To clean and freshen the roses, I lighty water sprayed this, so ok them out and they are ready to use again.

"I received one of these units as a review sample and I really liked it. This was very easy to install. Simply screw the wire adapter into the light socket and snap it in. The rotation worked well and it is very bright. I put this in my kitchen (will be ordering more) and was able to aim it to get the best overall light in the kitchen. It seems to be the perfect amount of directionality for me. The light disperses over a wide area but there is a definitive bright spot in the center. This is great for my kitchen because I can put stronger light on prep areas or the stove without making the entire room too bright. The dimming works great as well. I did not get any flicker and the maximum setting was brighter than I expected it to be. The color is the same as other 2700k bulbs I have so I did not have any problems with mismatching light colors.

I attached 2 photos, one with the light pointing at my stove, and one without. I'm not sure how well it comes across in the photo, but when cooking the hood actually blocks working light heavily. With the directional light pointed at the stove, it can get under the hood and lights up the cooktop very well. You can see the white rings on the rear ""burners"" in the photo with the light pointed at the stove. The backsplash is also much more visible. The downside of my cellphone camera is that the area almost looks too bright like there is a spotlight on it, but it does not come across that way in person.",1

"I bought this for my 60 gallon so I run it on the lowest setting. But wow. I ran a vortech mp10 for a little over a year on my tank. It worked alright  but even running on max it didn't provide the best of flow. To top if off I had one mp10 die after 6 months, get replaced under warranty and then turn around and die 8 months later again. At this point after the sub par performance, the incredible noise of the dry side and wearing out so quick for the money I decided to take a big step up. The xf-150 is amazing. Like I said earlier I run it at 10% and its made an amazing difference in my tank. The increased flow over the whole tank has made it so nothing settles and more gets filtered out so my nitrates have dropped and every piece of coral I have has perked up and started growing again. I really can't say enough how much of a difference switching from a Vortech mp10 to the Gyre XF-150 has made. Probably the single best purchase I have made for my tank besides my Maxspect Razr light.",0

"This is by far the cheapest case I have ever laid my hands on. It feels like the packaging for a faux case that would be a display. The material it's made out of is so flimsy I could bend the entire case in half and probably snap it with minimal effort. I wouldn't trust it to save the phone from dust hitting it let alone a fall. Also the craftsmanship and fit of the case is just poor all around. I really like the color of this case and how it should look, but was greatly disappointed when it arrived.

"This candle turns on by itself every day and never at the same time.  It is suppose to have three settings , on, off, automatic and be able to use the remote on/off that is purchased separately.  I have five of these candles and this is the only one that is doing this.  I might have not noticed if I hadn't moved it to my bedroom and the light woke me up every night since.  If I had left it in another room i would not have noticed it coming on randomly in the middle of the night,  Very disappointed.  I don't have the box anymore so I don't guess I can return it.",0

"I have set up several IP cameras and this was by far the easiest. QR codes are provided for the download of the phone app and for identifying the camera to the app. All you need to know is the password for your wifi. Total setup time was well under 5 minutes without needing to resort to using an Ethernet connection. The system comes ready for access from the world without any other configuration required. (Just remember to change the default password.)

The unit is well finished and small enough not to be intrusive, in case you plan to leave it out in view all the time. You can even turn off the power/wifi leds if you desire. If you intend to use the temperature probe, it needs to be moved away from the body so that it doesnt pick up the cameras heat. That does look a little ungainly. My only design complaint is that the micro-usb power input socket in located (in most mounting configurations) so that you need an angle-head connector. That is not a problem for a stock installation, as the included power supply is designed to fit. However, if you want to power it from a different usb source, you will probably have to buy another cord to fit.

Most of the functions can be controlled from the app (I only tried the iOS app) but there are several optional functions that may be easier to set up from the PC software. Those include things like motion or sound triggers and saving to an ftp server. Motion detection allows you to select the portion of the image you want to surveil and allows adjusting sensitivity.  I used the PC software to do both, trigger on motion and save to ftp, without any problem or need for the manual. (Using Chrome on Windows 10.) A full manual is available on the Wansview web site, should you need it, but most functions are pretty obvious.

I was able to connect with other 3rd party camera software so that all of my cameras can be viewed from one app. That was fine for viewing, but still required either the Wansview app or PC software for advanced functions.

Picture quality is excellent in HD, including in low light situations. There is some barrel distortion, but that is the trade-off for the wide view. You have the option to use lower quality video if you have bandwidth or storage limitations requiring it. Audio volume, on the other hand is marginal. It seems to pick up fine, but speaker volume is very low, even at maximum. It was adequate in a quiet room, but any background noise made it difficult to hear. As most uses depend on the camera picking up sound rather than producing it, this was not a major problem.

This camera excels at ease of setup and the video quality is indeed HD. If the form factor fits your needs for an indoor unit, the camera and software should work well for you.

I received the camera from the manufacturer in exchange for the promise of an honest review.",1

"LOVE IT!  When I was asked to review the Bright Outdoors Picnic Set for 2 I was pretty sure I would like it, however, I was not expecting to like it as much as I do. The compact size is fabulous!  I have had several different styles of picnic baskets over the years, but I really never used them due to the size, and bulk of them.  This set is slim and sleek, making it easy to leave this set in the car without it taking up much space. I love eating at the park with my girls during the summer, and pulling this out on a last minute picnic would make it extra special for them.  The only item really missing is cups/glasses, but obviously you will not be packing food in it so you can take care of drink cups when planning your food.

Now, as much as I like the picnic set, there is room for improvement.  I would give the set a higher rating if the plates were made of a healthier plastic choice.  We try to avoid plastics at home, and although we know there is a time and place for plastic, it would have made this set almost perfect had a better plastic choice been used. Also, it does say they are dishwasher safe, but being they are not made of a better plastic I would only hand wash them.  Same with the silverware - not 100% they will hold up over time in a dishwasher.

This would make a nice gift, something to keep in mind for the next gift-giving occasion. Another great thing to mention is the guarantee offered by the company, If you're not completely satisfied with your purchase simply let them know and you'll be offered a full refund or replacement.  We ordered our set from Amazon; the ordering was easy and shipping was fast.

"I ordered this product for free. The two piece case is interesting. The texture of the phone case is helpful to give grip when holding or to prevent from sliding out of your pocket. The fold out part, the stand, seems a little cheap. I am afraid to use it too often because I think it might break. I definitely won't let my kids use that feature. The clip holder unit is ok. Some goods are the soft lining to cushion your cell phone, the clip works well, and the texture matches the case. Some negatives, the clip has a slide out to make it stay open so you can stand the phone up, that seems cheap as well. I am afraid to use it and break the clip completely. The clips to put attach my phone are scary too. You have to use some force to get the phone in and it feels as if they are going to snap off. I am glad I have a back up so I am not scared to break this one.",1

"This shirt is so comfortable! It's also very flattering with it's loose cut and the length, as well. I find the fabric very soft, and sleek and I love that it doesn't get super wrinkled easily because I hate having to worry about wrinkles.

I love everything about the design of this shirt. First, it very long. I find I can wear it as a butt length tunic with leggings or as a shirt that- even on someone like me with a long torso- fits very nicely. The stretchy fabric at the bottom helps with keeping the bottom of the shirt in place and because of the length, the tunic actually stays where I want it to!

I also find that the cut at the bust is very flattering. The way the fabric hangs enhances busts that need it (mine!) but also flatters larger chested women as well. It's not too sexy for youth to wear, but looks great on all ages of women. I'm so happy with this v-neck top!

"I have recently been trying to broaden my horizons in regards to my taste in tea and found myself with a couple fun sampler packs of loose tea leaves but no diffusers. So, I decided to purchase the ""Long Handle Tea Infusers"" and try them out! After using them a few times, I have to say that I'm really pleased with them! Not only are they functional, but they also look pretty nice in a mug. I feel very sophisticated in the tea arts when using them. :) The spring's action is smooth, and the holes are nice and tiny! I did have a leaf or two slip out, but I think that's just from leaves that were caught in the seam when I closed the diffuser. These diffusers are a great, environmentally friendly alternative to to other disposable options. I really like that they're stainless steel. I worry about chemicals being leached out of plastic diffusers by the hot/boiling water, and the fact that they're made out of stainless steel helps them to ward off getting stained (though I can see this happening down the line, tea is persistent). I also really love the long handled aspect to these diffusers. You can use them to stir in sugar or milk, and it makes them easier to handle. I've found that dealing with diffusers on chains increases the likelihood of drips. My only complaint is that the way the balls slide open means that you can only fill up half of the ball. Now, that's plenty for your average cup of tea, but it definitely means that these are only suitable for individual cups. I also think that the price for this product is good. At $12.99 for a set of 5, each diffuser is essentially $2.60. That's a good deal for how good these diffusers are! Overall, these diffusers are great, and I am super excited to use these to try out my new teas!

UPDATE: I've come to the conclusion that it's not just leaves stuck in the seam that I'm finding in my tea. What happens is that when the leaves are submerged in the hot water they are able to slip out through the holes a lot more easily. However, it's not that many and they all end up sinking to the bottom. Honestly, the holes on these infusers are pretty small. You'd probably need a tea bag to *completely* eliminate the escapee tea leaves.

"When I unrolled the flags I didn't realize they were all attached. Going by the product pictures it looks like they are individual flags. But it's actually a stream of flags.

"OVERVIEW
The thing about CCTV cameras is that they don't do much by themselves, and are only a single piece of the security puzzle. Cameras serve two main purposes: capturing events and deterrence. The resolution of a lot of home cameras may be too low to actually catch anything, and Im feeling particularly frugal so Im trying out this fake camera.

CONSTRUCTION
The best feature of this camera is that it looks reasonably real. There is a flashing red LED light to make you think that it is recording. The camera can rotate to aim camera. And, there are no identifiable markings or logos that makes it a dead giveaway.

CAVEATS
The white part of the camera is clearly plastic, and looks cheaply constructed. The camera requires 2 AA batteries for the red LED light.

CONCLUSION
As a cheap deterrent, this is a great unit, even better than the fake CCTV cameras that you see being sold. Simplicity is key. No dead-ringer logos.

The worst part of the camera is that the LED light requires 2 AA batteries, and Im not sure how long they last, but of course, the camera still works to make people think it is a real camera without a flashing red LED light.

Whether you're going to supplement your security with some fake cameras as deterrents or just want to be cheap, this is a great product to get.

"Great Rain Boots! Stylish yet functional. There are lots of colors and designs available. These boots are light weight but feel sturdy enough to withstand some mud. They are tall enough to keep water from splashing inside , unless you go hog wild ;) The seams are tight and of course waterproof. The inside lining is smooth and soft so even if you had to just slip them on real quick without socks, they are comfortable. Good ankle and arch support and great thread so you get decent traction.

I had a little problem with the sizing chart. I chose the size according to the measurements shown on the chart provided but found that, though it looks like my foot would fit in the ""foot"" part , there is no way I could get my foot past the ankle part =(  I was going to exchange the boots for the correct size but have decided to just give them to my niece. She wears a size 8 and can easily get her foot into these size 9 boots. They are a bit big but fit well with socks. She loves them!
The kids spend a lot of time romping around in the barnyard and it's been very rainy this year so ... MUD! My family goes through a lot of boots every year.  So far so good, these are easy to hose off, still waterproof  and no cracks or cuts, even after the pony stepped on her foot. She said that she does not slip around as much with these boots as she does with her old pair so the thread passes the mud test. Now she wants a ""flashy, flowery, more colorful"" pair to wear while she's at stables. Kids will be kids...LOL.  Actually I have my eye on one of the other designs, too.

Disclaimer: I received these boots at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review. Though it is not required that I give a positive review, I can honestly say that these boots appear to be a well constructed and, according to my niece, are comfortable.  She really loves this pair and would consider getting another pair soon.",1

"The tempered glass is crystal clear, if I hadn't put it on my iPad I wouldn't know it was there.

I mention that because I have ordered multipacks of phone protectors before and gotten one set of install supplies; no worries with this set you get five and five!

"I'm not going to lie, I got this only because I love the color and I find the design very cute.
I wasn't expecting very good quality, and, no, I did not get it. The wallet will probably last me a few weeks before it falls a part. Nevertheless, it is still really cute, it looks good, and I am receiving loads of compliments for it.

The wallet is made of PU leather which is very soft - this is why I don't think the wallet is going to last very long.
It is very convenient as it does have more than enough slots for credit cards. On the left hand side, you have slots for 5 credit cards and 1 ID slot. These are arranged vertically so you can easily access whatever you need. My only complaint is that the edges of the slots are soft (there is no stitching to make them harder) so it is a little painful to put your card back after you've taken it out.
On the right hand side, you have another 6 credit card slots. This time, they are arranged horizontally and they do have the extra stitching on the rim that makes it easy to insert your card..

You have a special coin section that closes with a zip. It's not like anyone uses coins any more but this section is very useful for anything small you want to keep handy. I use it for my spare pair of daily contact lenses.

You also have 3 slots for cash. I was a little bit afraid that it wouldn't fit USD dollars as the bank notes are a little wider than other currencies and the wallet looked small. No need to worry though, the bills fit in perfectly.

"This is a fantastic laptop stand that allows for excellent heat exchange and ergonomics for the laptop and user. First off, this is a relatively simple product. It's designed to raise the back of the laptop up just a little bit to allow air exchange underneath it while it is seated on a desk. In that job, it does it perfectly. The incline isn't too steep and is slight but the air exchange is absolutely better.

I personally always de-dust my laptop when I have the chance and some compressed air lying around. That said, you can never quite replicate the heat exchange you can get by raising the laptop just a little bit to allow the bottom fans to have air to suck in/push out. The increased efficiency of heat exchange is noticeable.

My only other comment is that I love how the incline increases the ergonomics of the laptop keyboard. If you type of the laptop, just know that some people find a flat keyboard more ergonomic, some find a slight incline more ergonomic. I am of the latter and I have found typing to be significantly easier on this laptop than before I had it. Overall a fantastic product and does just as advertised.

"This is a very nicely made leather color. The leather smell is pretty strong initially, but fades after some time. The thing I really like about this collar is that it is a buckle closure, so it won't come off unless you take it off manually. I started off with a collar that had a plastic snap in, but if there is too much pressure it snaps right off (I had to learn this the hard way). I got the brown color - I thought it would be a little lighter in person and kind of regret not getting the lighter brown color now, but oh well. Be sure to look closely at the measurements before choosing your size, I got the M when I probably should have gotten the S, but that's completely my fault. But overall I think this is a great collar that will last a long long time. Disclaimer: I received this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1

The HomySnug Can Opener was definitely not as easy to use as quoted. It is made out of quality products that will last you, and the edges are in fact smooth. You will not receive any cuts from the can after using this product. But by golly it is hard to remove. I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on using a can opener as I have been using them for the past 10 odd years. But to get the lid off the can after going completely around the rim was a bit of a task that involved muscle. Again having difficulty with removing the lid from the device itself. Even with backing off the cutter part by rotating the handle counter clockwise. Could just be my unit! Other than that good quality item.

This is by far one of the sharpest lens Canon has ever produced! Except for the prime lens. It surpasses the 16-35 F2.8 II without a doubt. I'm so glad I purchased this lens instead of the F2.8 II. It's now my favorite walk-around lens.,0

"My daughter's corgi weighs 30 lbs. and the medium fits perfectly. It has a wrap around flap for under the belly which is meshed to let water and air flow. The buckles are easy to snap in and the top of the jacket has a handle to lift my dog out of the water. There is also a nylon loop near the back neck to attach a leash to...a big improvement from a different jacket I had before. The only complaint is not the fault of the jacket...it is a bit long on her corgi's torso, covering up his boy parts...so he can't pee with it on.

"I absolutely love this dress. When I first saw it I asked myself is this too much and after purchasing it and seeing it in person I have decided it is just enough lol. This is such a fun outfit. I love everything about it from the huge lips to the word flawless written on it! The dress size medium is a great fit! I will admit the dress is short but i expected this. I usually wear a 10 in dresses now that I am starting to lose weight and it fits nicely. It will fit even nicer as I lose more weight!

The fit is very nice and flattering. It hugs the curves but not in a bad way. I will include a picture to show you what I mean. It doesn't make my extra fluff in the middle look bad lol. With it being white there is always a concern that it will be transparent but it really isn't transparent which is awesome. I'm really excited to wear this out in the town. It is definitely a fun and flattering statement outfit. Personally I think it looks amazing! I did receive this dress at a slight discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My opinions are my own and truthful. I really hope you found this review helpful.",1

"I absolutely love this fur ball. The color is very vibrant and I provided a picture to illustrate it. It's super fluffy, which is what I mainly expect out of a fur ball. Also, it has been well put together, which is what really matters because I don't want to have to replace it any time soon unless I just want to change colors. I get plenty of compliments on my fur ball and it's much bigger than the first one I bought. The packaging for this fur ball was a little strange compared to the packaging my other fur balls came in. This one came in like a seal up plastic bag which I may be able to reuse, but it kind of flattened out my fur ball. The keychain portion is well made and seems like it will withstand time. Whether or not it may be explicitly obvious, I received this product at a deeply discounted price in exchange for my honest review of the product. With that being said, I was not compensated to leave a favorable review as I am not obligated to do so.

"I definitely prefer this watch style band over the other one that I purchased from this company. Once the band is on I have no concerns that it will fall off just by popping out of place. Since I had issues with the color not being accurate on the last band I chose to go with the white one this time around. Can't really mess that up... This band is a lot softer than the stock band that came with the Samsung Gear S2. I only really have one complaint, it is not really suited for people with small wrists. I wear the stock small band on the 2nd/3rd to last hole. With this band I am on the very last hole and it is still just a tad loose. I had no issues snapping this band into place and it was not that difficult to remove either. I've seen some negative reviews on this item referring to the band quality. The one that I have seems to be very well made and fits up against the watch perfectly once it is snapped into place. My only wish is that they added a few more holes for those of us with smaller wrists. I received this product for free or at a reduced price, the review above is my unbiased opinion.",1
"Let me help you!  I took a bunch of photos, and measured the figurine, in the hopes that it helps someone, because there weren't enough photos when I ordered this.  For reference, the coin in the photos below is a US quarter. Here's what you need to know:

1.)  Yes, it's very small.  Smaller then the top of my thumb.  It measures roughly 1 and 1/8 inches tall, or 28.5mm.  (See photos in comparison with a quarter, which has a ~24mm diameter.)

2.)  It looks like a cross between an angel and an owl, because the head is disproportionately large compared the the body.  It's not terrible, but it definitely gives it a cartoonish look.

3.)  Is it really ""obsidian?""  I'm not sure.  Obsidian usually has a glassy translucence.  This is completely opaque, and looks like it might be onyx or artificially colored calcite.  Don't know.

It comes in a black velveteen pouch, although the pouch is not necessarily keepsake quality, so I'd be inclined to toss it.  I guess you could put it on a shelf as a decoration, since the base is flat enough for it to stand upright, but it's so small that it could knocked away with the slightest impact.  It's cute, I guess, although I'm just saying that because of the giant head.  It's actually mildly freakish.  But it's pleasant enough, and if you're the type of person who likes to carry this kind of thing around, it's pretty good---just not great.

I purchased the Snuggle-Pedic pillow and was then contacted by the company to ask if I would be willing to receive a pillow cover in exchange for an unbiased review. I like having a removable, washable pillow cover and this one had all the attributes I would normally look for. The pillow itself is a little high for me (I like a very flat pillow) and rather than have it customized, which the company told me would be very simple, I passed the pillow on to my husband for whom it is the perfect size. he really likes it. The pillow cover is nice and stretchy and it seems very breathable. It is super soft and comfy, although we do put a linen pillowcase over it. I cannot attest to its durability, since we have only had it for 6 weeks or so. But, if I purchase another Snuggle-Pedic pillow to have customized, which I might, I also would definitely purchase the removable cover to go with it.",1
"The sample that I received cannot be used since the bolt for upper die is misaligned by 10 degrees. This causes every die that I attach to the upper bolt to sit at a 10 degree angle to the lower die.

I'm still giving 5 stars because:

1. This type of failure can happen with any such type of card (of any brand) and a single failure does not indicate poor quality (I may revise this later if the replacement card fails).

"Im quite particular when it comes to my sheets.  The Empyrean brand bedding set has many high points, along with a few flaws in my opinion.  I purchased the cream beige, and I was happy to see that the color on my monitor was slightly different from the actual color of what I received.  On the monitor, the color is a bit more yellow tinged in my opinion.  What came was a true beige.  What also came in the packaging was a Better Sleep Guide booklet which gave tips for sleeping better at night, and even how to make your bed in the most effective way.

I immediately washed the set, and right out of the washer, they were nearly dry.  They only took 10 minutes in the dryer (alone), and I was ready to make my bed.  Ive had microfiber sheets before, but theres something different about these.  The front of the sheet (ceiling facing), is the super soft typical microfiber feeling.  The underneath (body facing), feels more like a satin.  Its very odd.  I had a feeling that the sheets would be warm for this time of year, and I was right.  These are definitely for cooler months!  These sheets feel like they will last for years though.  One of my favorite points of the set was the elastic suspenders on the fitted sheets.  They ensure that you won't be adjusting the bottom sheet in the middle of the night.  I have a memory foam king mattress, and most sheets don't ever fit the mattress properly.  One side always pops off.  These sheets seem to be made with a little extra material, because every inch of my mattress is covered without having to struggle.  The three-line stitching on the pillow cases and top sheet add a touch of elegance and class to the set that really make it beautiful.

Very good blackout style curtains - I'd rate it at somewhere around 95% effective at blocking out direct sunlight which is good enough for me. The curtains are constructed from polyester woven fabric and manages to pull off looking soft and natural from afar while providing the durability and color fading prevention you'd expect from polyester. The cut of fabric is thick and somewhat rigid and is affixed with extra wide grommets that will certainly accommodate all curtain rods found in home dwellings. I have the 'Dark Grey' version which easily blends into just about any decorative setting and color palette around (product sample provided for review).,1
"The smart bracelet was received on time, packaged well, and in good condition.  I decided to use this smart bracelet for a couple days before writing a review.  This smart bracelet was purchased for my son who is a sophomore in college and generally wears a nice Seiko with a leather band.  This smart bracelet will be used during times when it is not desirable to wear his nice watch.  For example, going to the gym, going to pick-up soccer games, doing yard work, or taking a walk.

Things I like about the smart bracelet:
- Nice style
- Comfortable band
- Seems to keep good time
- Shows the date and day of the week
- Has an alarm function
- Vibrates when receiving a phone call or text message
- Battery seems to be lasting pretty long
- Paired easily with multiple iPhones
Things he might use:
- Sleep tracker
- Activity tracker
- Find iPhone
- Activity tracker
Things the smart bracelet can do that he won't use:
- Start iPhone music
- Take a picture on iPhone

I was able to install the app on each iPhone and pair the smart bracelet easily.  Since the manual is not written in very good English, and there is not detailed information on the app, the learning curve is steeper than it needs to be.  Once familiar with how to operate the smart bracelet and the app, everything was pretty straight forward.  You will want to select the menu button (three horizontal lines) on the apps main screen then select the profile picture.  This will allow you to input your personal information.  This is not well explained and should help you to get more accurate readings for steps, calorie burn, etc.

There are two things that could be improved on this watch:
- The step count does not seem to be consistent.  Sometimes it is accurate, but other times it is not accurate.  Sometimes there is no increase in reading at all.  There may be a certain arm swing that is needed. But I haven't figured that out.
- I have the display set to turn off after 10 seconds.  When turning my wrist to see the display, there is some inconsistency with the display turning on or not.  I would say the display turns on about 75% of the time.  When it does not turn on, I turn my wrist again or push the button to turn the display on.
There are many settings for this smart bracelet, most of which require the app to change the settings.  Some reviewers complained about the app, but I would describe it as a simple app that does the job.  I had no problems with the app itself on my iPhone 6.  After making changes, you will need to sync the app and the phone.

Overall this smart bracelet will fit my sons needs, but since we have not used other fitness watches, we cannot compare the step counter accuracy which seems to be the main issue with this product.  Maybe these type of watches are generally inaccurate, but I expected more accuracy on the steps than we experienced.

We received this smart bracelet at a discount in exchange for an honest and accurate review.  I feel that we have used this watch long enough to provide a fair evaluation.",1
Love the coffee pot.  No problems as if now.,0
"This is a really nice quality bag. The blue canvas almost looks like denim, is really thick and very strong. I tend to over pack my bags and have every confidence this one will more than hold the weight of any stress I'll be putting on it. The bag is about the size of an airline carry-on, which is great, but I travel by car more than by air. So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the bag had zippered extensions on the left and right sides. The zippers go all the way around the bag, so all you have to do is unzip them to make the bag longer. It probably adds 6 inches or so.

There's two side compartments on the left and right ends, which is pretty standard for bags like this. Typically, the lining inside the duffel bag separating the side compartments from the main compartment, is usually made of a really flimsy nylon. Over time, this nylon tears at the seam, rendering the end compartments virtually useless. This tearing issue is almost always the reason I go shopping for a new bag. But the cool thing with this one, is those dividers are made of strong canvas, not flimsy nylon.

Everything about this bag says quality. The zippers are really strong but function smoothly. The handles are thick and strong. The leather zipper pulls look great. Having said that, the straps do dig into my shoulder when the bag is weighted down, but that happens with most bags I've had. The bag has lots of pockets and places to put things. Just in time for summer fun.

I was given this free in exchange for an honest review.",1

Pretty and practical. Look exactly as pictured.,0
"I recently received the Complete Personal Survival Kit and Emergency Pack for Cars, Trucks, RVs, and Trailers which is in a waterproof bag.  Pictures are included with this review of everything in the one I received.  I don't claim to be an expert on survival or some kind of survivalist, but I have been involved in survival discussions for over 40 years and have my own survival packs filled with survival items I picked out.  I will review this kit for what it is, a light duty kit that is a great starting point for someone to keep in their vehicle.

There are too many scenarios to speculate on that could leave someone stranded with their vehicle.  However some of the conditions that one could experience are pretty easy to list. Thirst, hunger, cold, darkness and injury are among the conditions that this kit can help someone survive.

There are 4 water pouches that resemble juice boxes in this kit.  They contain 6.75 ounces each for a total of 27 ounces.  This is not enough water to survive days on, but it is better than nothing and should help with a short delay.  Along the same lines there are two energy bars included.  These bars provide 400 calories each and are pretty well balanced with carbs, protein and fat.  In a situation where you don't have much to eat it is important to have carbs for fuel, fat and protein in combination to provide some feeling of satisfaction and to help delay feelings of hunger.  Another benefit of these bars is that they are low sodium, which will help keep from driving water needs up.

To help with cold there is a poncho to wrap yourself up in to help stop heat loss as well as a Mylar emergency blanket.  The poncho of course could also help with rain, and the Mylar blanket can also be used to create a temporary shelter, or to keep you up off the bare ground.  Gloves and two different sizes of air activated warming pouches are included.  The gloves seem to be heavy enough to be used to work on a car as well as to keep your hands warm.  The smaller warmers could be put in the gloves or in your socks, while the larger warmers would make your poncho nice and warm.  If nothing else fails there are matches that could be used to build a fire.  These are good quality waterproof matches that should last a long time.

To help with the darkness there is a headlamp that has two brightness levels, a red light, and the ability to make the red lamp flash.  AAA alkaline batteries are included in the headlamp and there are also spare batteries when those fail.  There is also a small flashlight on the wristband that uses button cell batteries which are in it.  It would be good for occasional use.  Two button cell battery operated glow sticks that are advertised to last for 200 hours each should provide some light to catch a rescuers eye at night.  They are green, which the way I understand it works better than red as a green light can be seen from farther away than a red light.  Speaking of alerting rescuers, there is a whistle on the wristband that produces a piercing loud noise that could help them know they are in the right area.

In case of very minor injury there is a small first aid kit in a resealable pouch.  It has alcohol pads for disinfection and antiseptic towelettes to help prevent skin infections.  There are a a couple of sterile gauze sponges and three different sizes of small band aids. A plastic sheet with filter is included to help with mouth to mouth resuscitation.  A couple of light dust masks are included.

Various other items include a multipurpose tool in a pouch, duck tape, tissues and waste disposal bags.  It may sound crude, but if you are stuck in your car and have to use the bathroom, you can do it in the bag, finish the paperwork part of the job with the tissues and then wrap the mouth of the bag with duct tape to keep it closed.

The waterproof bag that this is all included in could be emptied and used to carry water if needed.

This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  Honestly, this would be a good gift for folks who have no idea where to start on a survival kit for their vehicle.  Depending on where you live there are many other things that could be added to this kit, and that would verify by the person and their abilities.

"Ordered this as it is so so cute in the pictures.  I collect hats and wear them literally every single day of the week doesnt matter whether i am going to work or out on the town or to a fancy occasion there is never a time a hat is not on my head unless i am sleeping and even then i wear a satin head wrap to protect my hair.  Anyway i was digressing,  when i pulled this hat our of the box ti got shipped it, it was folded up and squished up.  There is no metal rim so i thought maybe i could iron out the creases that were in the brim from it being folded twice.  Boy was i wrong.  These were permanent creases in the hat and they were not coming out no matter what i tried.  I spend over an hours.  Now here is the funny part.  I spend an hour on this hat trying to get it straightend out and it did succeed in making it look better (not good by any means but better) so i figured it could maybe just be a hat i wear around our property when working in the garden or something but nope its way way to small.  Says its a woman's hat however I don't know any women with the head size of a 5 year old little girl.  So I would NOT recommend this hat unless you are the looking for a special project to do at home and figure out how to get the creases from the horrible shipping out of the the hat and then as well as have a super tiny head.  If you do fall into that category then this is the hat for you.  If you are looking for a hat that is wearable (because you just paid money for it) and would fit a ""normal"" size womans head then don't waste your money on this hat.  I received this hat at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.",1
"These Ailihen C6 headphones are well designed for rigorous use. The inner headphone ear cushions feel like a luxurious leather. The stems which hold the headphones together are a heavy metal like stainless steel. Just plug the cable into the bottom of the ear cushion and the unit simultaneously. There is a plug at the bottom of each ear cushion. In testing, the sound coming from these ear cushions is a very high quality with a stereo-like sound. These headphones are a superior product which works well on testing. The reviewer asked for and received a free sample for testing purposes and rendering an honest appraisal. The product has a 6 month warranty. Customer support may be contacted here: {SERVICE at Ailihen dot com}

Generally, the claims of the manufacturer are true on inspection. These claims are as follows:
 AILIHEN C6 headphones are designed to perform on the move - especially in noisy environments such as tubes, buses and trains. A deeply padded ear surrounds block out much of the outside world, without the need for power-sapping active noise isolation. The C6 also delivers a powerful bass response, along with all the clarity you'd expect from AILIHEN.

C6 Headphones feature detachable double-ended coil cord with mic and remote control is equipped with an L-plug end, providing improved durability. The dual 3.5 mm jacks allow you to choose either side you prefer to wear your cable on or to plug in and share your music with a friend.

Constructed hinges and headband design, the C6 headset fits better than ever. Allowing for increased flexibility and the ear caps to rotate more freely, the C6 adapts to your head shape for increased comfort during those long listening sessions as well as folding flat for ease of storage. Their construction is tough enough to take a daily commute while still offering long-term comfort.",1

"I was saving this for a build I was making but when a friend kept losing his quad in high brush I decided to give it to him.

Good thing I did!  If he didn't have this device he would have lost his quad today! He has been having transmitter issues and occasionaly his quad will drop out of the sky. Today we were flying in a rather brushy area and it happened. Normally we grid out an area and go look for it, but this time he wasn't sure where it was. Luckily, using a switch on his transmitter he was able to engage the beeping which led us right to the quad in no time.

This is a no brainer for anyone flying expensive toys! Spend a few bucks to save you hundreds! I recommend this to everyone who flies model RC aircraft.

The unit has three modes:

A) An alram for voltage alarm
B) A stand-alone finder for lost models
C) Signal alarm

"I am really enjoying these Liquid Chalk Markers. I had never owned any markers like this before and decided to give them a try. The first thing I noticed was that you had choices with the tips. You could either leave them as a bullet tip or carefully take them out, turn them around, and then you would have a chisel edge. My personal preference is a bullet tip, so I only turned one around and used it as a chisel edge. Make sure you decide which way you want the nib before you begin the process of bringing down the liquid chalk. If not, you will have quite a mess on your hands.

To get the marker started, simply push down the tip on a clean flat non-porous surface until you see liquid begin to puddle. And behold, your marker is ready to use. It truly is that simple. When you are done using your marker, cap it tightly so it does not dry out.

I tried this marker on non-porous surfaces such as the box it came in, glass, plastic cups and plates and paper. It wiped off of the non-porous surfaces with no problems. I absolutely loved the way it behaved on paper. I used it to highlight areas of my paintings where I needed a bold white color. The paint was nice and opaque and covered the painting beautifully.

I will be getting some chalkboard labels soon and plan on using these markers to label my art drawers. This way, I will know what is in each drawer and if I do a little rearranging, I can always erase what I have written and start again.

I did receive this product for free for my thorough review and honest opinion. These are my thoughts and conclusions solely.",1

Overall a great buy and definitely would recommend this to friends and family. Thank you! First off, this package arrived on time and neatly folded in a nice package! There was no distinct smell that most new cloth products have. I was very impressed when I first opened these. The material of these curtains are extremely high quality! It is very thick and the feel is almost silky. Nice to touch and heavy so you know that they didn't skimp out on the extra fabric. There are no loose stitches and the rings at the top are very well built in! These curtains are durable enough to block out all sunlight and give your house a nice elegant look and feel. Overall, I am incredibly happy with my purchase and will definitely recommend this product to my friends and family!

"I have a sliding screen door to my deck.  I tried this item to see if I could avoid the wear and tear to my sliding screen (too many kids in and out of the house).  My kids and the kept getting caught up in the magnets and the dog managed to pull the tacks out of the woodwork. Maybe if you want to use this item in place of a screen door that's never used....but for now,  I'll deal with the wear and tear to my slider.

nice product and helps prevent sweat from pouring down your forehead,0
"I got this for my daughter. No way will it fit her. She is a stocky girl and it is just too small for her. The fit on this bra I would call a extra small to a small size. Not a one size fits most.
 It was made in the United States. Normally items made in the United States are larger sizes than items made other places.
 It is quality made. It will fit me and I will be glad to wear it. The bra has holes on the inside where you can take out the memory foam pieces in the front. Maybe for washing purposes?
  It will work for those who wear a size small and will last a while.

"This product is extremely sturdy yet flexible at the same time. From the large clip at one end to the jaw clip at the other, the extension is quite long. I am able to clip the item onto my desk and have my cell phone held in place along side my laptop. There is much versatility in being able to move this item from place to place.

"I recently purchased the GrowGreen 25 Ft heavy Duty Expanding Hose. This is a great expandable hose.  It comes with a bag for storage, a very nice heavy duty spray nozzle, a shutoff valve, and a hose hanger.  I also like the fact that this company offers a 12 month guarantee on their product.  This hose is much easier to use when watering my flowers than the traditional rubber hoses that are very heavy and hard to drag around, my young son has no problem using this hose, it is so lightweight .  When you turn the water off it immediately shrinks back to its original size.  It is also easy to connect and the fittings are sturdy and well made.  If you are looking for an expandable hose I definitely recommend this product!

"Used it for one 4 day hiking trip. Its definitely bright enough, but the black front piece fell off already (the part attached to the light). No idea where it fell and its lost now.

"I have wanted one of these for a long time and have been comparing different types. What I love, very light weight and fits in a small area when not being used. I would suggest pulling it out to it's full length before you turn on the water, otherwise it is almost harder to move than a rubber hose because it is so flexible. Also there was a little snagging on the nylon cover, but that does not effect the hose, and that will happen if it rubs anything rogh like rocks or a sidewalk. The brass fittings are nice and no dripping at all. I used it with a water wand and without to check the pressure. I did notice that if I stepped on the hose to stop the flow, the water seemed to have greater pressure after. It works great for watering my garden, and I have a lot of flowers to go around. If you wanted this for a hard spray to wash off the house I would stick with a rubber hose.
 I would definitely buy this again because it is so light and compact and no more hose to wrestle with. I will wind up my other hose and use for power washing if needed.

"Let me just start by saying that for a small glass mounted (suction cup) DVR priced under 20 bones you're getting exactly the quality you're paying for and what that is, is a low cost lens and simplified video recording system that requires you to provide your own SD memory card to actually put the device to use.

The device is small and lightweight but fit and finish leaves a bit to be desired as it is housed in flimsy, black plastic. When the small (2.5 inch) screen is folded up into the camera the device looks like one of those chunky pagers from the 80's. The device works as intended and functions reasonably well as a simple, no fuss straight ahead video record system. While low light or night time record quality is inadequate for most archival needs day time results are not too shabby although at a sub HD quality (to my eyes at least). Overall if you need a quick and dirty system for capturing your driving during daylight hours this product will get the job done but just keep in my mind that at then end of it all you're getting exactly the level of quality you'd expect from a sub 20 dollar product (product sample provided by manufacturer/dealer for review purposes).",1

These poop bags are wonderful!  I have reused plastic bags from the store to clean up after the dogs.  Most of the bags have holes in the bottom so you have to be careful when using or you have a bigger mess and the bags are meant to carry items home from the store so they are larger than you need for dog duty clean up. The Pet N Pet bags come on a easy to grab a bag roll and are large enough to get the job done.  The bags do not tear or rip when you use them.  I received this item at a discount  for my honest and unbiased review.  I would and will recommend the bags to family and friends.,1

"The online reviews are very accurate. The sound is surprisingly strong and it favors the bass. I took it on vacation in the countryside of Italy where I had no other entertainment sources. I used it indoors and outdoors regularly for two weeks, and also used it on long drives. I was satisfied in every environment. I listen to a lot of classical - it's not at its best with big, complex orchestrations due to the bass. Despite that I was very happy with the overall quality. I also listen to jazz - it was great for American Songbook artists. I think other popular music should be great too.",0

"This is a great little speaker! I was a little hesitant to stick it under water, but the sound stayed clear and it still works. It is easy to bluetooth with my phone and has a good sound. The bass is good, which is a big plus to me, and it has good volume. The only problem I have is my sons keep taking it from me! I have tried several small speakers before, and it is very difficult to find one at a decent price that has good sound. This speaker does all of that. Being waterproof is a big plus so we can take it to the lake! For those who think it is difficult to pair, just hold the power button until it tones, then the speaker tells you bluetooth is on. My phone picked it up immediately. You can also use it with the enclosed auxiliary cord, but I found it completely unnecessary. The battery is long-lasting so it lasted all day at the lake.

"This is a nice set of straps.  They are rated for 250 pounds with breaking weight of 750 pounds. These straps are made of a high strength nylon. The buckle is coated with zinc to prevent rusting. The buckle is also spring loaded so it closes when released and holds securely.  There are little teeth on the buckle that bite into the strap to hold it securely without causing damage to the strap.  These strap are very well made and have done their intended job perfectly.  I have used these straps to move my son to his college dorm. They held his boxes and furniture. Nothing shifted or became unsecured during the move.  I also hauled both round and square bales of hay using these straps. They held the hay tight without getting loose even at highway speeds.  While unloading hay I had some shift and if it wasn't for these straps they would have fell from the trailer and broke.  I am very pleased with the performance of these straps.

These straps work just as well as the ratcheting straps.  Like any strap you want to protect it from sharp edges.  If you use it to hold anything with sharp put something on the edge to prevent the strap from being cut.  The pack I received had two straps that are 12 feet long.so far I have not had any issues with these straps.  Whether for commercial work or home use these straps are perfect for getting the job done.

I received these straps for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This did not influence my opinion of the product in any way.",1

You get 3 of them in the package, along with the metal clasp and a plastic clasp to ensure the band does not fall off. I have been wearing mine since I got it the mail. These bands are not your traditional solid colors, they have designs on them and look stylish. My husband told me that it makes it look less like a Fitbit and more like a piece of jewelry. When I first put it on it felt a little foreign, but I had not worn my band in weeks because it had broke, now that I have had it on for almost a week, I have forgotten it is even there. The tracker goes in without any difficulties, it does not fit too tight or loose. The tracker comes out easily just like putting it in. I have done the dishes and showered while wearing my band and I have no encountered any issues once so ever. I was truly blown away by the quality and the designs of these bands, that is the main reason for my 5 star rating. If you are looking for Fitbit Flex bands and do not want to pay the price on their site, give these a try. They are better than the traditional bands, you can have a more stylish band that says something about you!

"I always have a case on my phone. I usually go though them a lot with the design on them coming off. I decided to give this case a try, I usually buy ones with more protection on the screen. I figured since I have a tempered glass screen protector it would be ok. My first impression of this case is, its a really pretty pink case. It's pretty durable so I don't think I'll have to worry if I drop my phone. I like the rubber casing around the edges to protect it. It fits my iPhone 6 Plus perfectly. It is a little slippery when holding, which I'm not a fan of but it's not to terrible. The design of this case is nice and sleek. I like this case because I don't have to worry about the design rubbing off from coming in and out of my pocket. I think the price on this case is reasonable for the quality you're getting.

"We recently had a friend get hit by a vehicle while riding and it reminded us how important it is to be well lit when riding at night. We already have red lights, but I decided to replace my current set up with this light because of its many features. It have a blinking red light with multiple patters, which I feel brings more attention to the light. I also like that is have rear following lasers to identify your road spare to others. The left, forward and right signals are a great addition for when you are riding on a public road. It is also a great benefit when in on a crowded public trail. The battery is rechargeable and the battery lasts quite awhile before it needs to be recharged. The attachment is easy, anyone can figure it out. I recommend this product to any cyclist.

"Okay, semi expert here. This is my fourth Harmony universal remote in about ten years. Perhaps that leads to conclusions about issues of longevity? I'm a little torn on that. Yes, they do get daily work, but a little more in the build quality, especially for the steep price, seems warranted. Battery life on the previous models was also not good - I am talking about rechargeable models.

Sadly, nobody makes as usable as a remote as Logitech/Harmony. If I am wrong please tell me in the comments - I am willing to switch!

While easy to use, easy to set up is not the same thing. If you are tech savvy, it is not too difficult and the biggest challenge is first, getting all your correct model numbers for all your gear, second, knowing enough about how you have all this set up in terms of both audio and video inputs and outputs. Advice, write it down and keep it on file. That is a fair amount of work and takes some knowledge. Unlike my last model, the default button setup for this and my different devices was a bit off. I had to ""customize"" button settings for my cable box (FIOS) to properly use the Favorites guide and a few other things including On Demand - that's right, no default button set up for On Demand. In actual use my wife was able to start using it right away, but there are some quibbles here and there on having this be the only remote we need. Back to cable, but some often used functions, like search, are more cumbersome with this than the FIOS remote. We can live with it and let that stay in a drawer, but again, for $250 I think we can all demand a bit more thoughtfulness and user testing. Not to be AV elitist, but I don't think your average person with an average set up is going to shell out $250 for a remote. We want ease of use, but also versatility. FYI, I am running this with a HD TV, audio video receiver and a 5.1 surround setup, FIOS cable box, Roku 4, blueray DVD player and (for old family stuff I am working to convert) an actual VHS VCR!

P.S. Swipe gesture thing is a gimmick and not very useful - volume buttons are easier to use. Would have much rather had the effort of this go into lower cost or functionality. Form factor/ergonomics is not the best either. Volume, channel, guide - highly used buttons not in a natural position for the hand. Hire a real Human Factors person please!",0
"I received this case a day early than expected. Super fast shipping! I received this at no cost for review.  I was so excited to open it and get it put on my phone. When I opened the package I noticed how beautiful the design was. Very vibrant colors. It actually looks like a sketch done with colored pencils, its so pretty. Like a work of art on my phone case. I snapped my phone into the inside case which was a bit rubbery or like silicone. My iphone 6 s fit perfect, like a glove, I knew it would hold in secure. The case closes like a little book and has a magnetic clasp to hold it closed. The only concern I had was the hole for the camera looked a little off, but I proceeded to take a picture to make sure that it wasn't obstructing and it was fine. I took pictures all weekend and didn't notice anything in the view. The feel of it is so soft and smooth, I have received 3 compliments on this case already and I have only had it for 3 days. Thank you guys so much for fast shipping and a beautiful product to keep my phone safe.",1

"For the most part I have had a good experience with this coffee grinder. I use it mainly for espresso, and it grind quite fine which ends up being perfect. However, I could see this being a problem if you wished to have a course grind, like for french press or regular coffee. Also the amount of coffee that can fit into the grinder is great for a double espresso shot but would not be good if I wished to brew a full pot of coffee.

Using the grinder is fairly easy but a little tedious. It takes a little while which is not my favorite thing to do first thing in the morning. But it is the price to pay for a fresh grind. I would probably do better with an electric grinder verse the hand crank.

I have yet to take it apart to clean it. I know that is probably bad but I looked at the directions and just thought, ""I don't need to do that every time"". Again, it was too early for all of that.

I appreciate it's sleek look. It does not bother me to leave out on my counter next to my espresso machine. Since it is so tall it doesn't fit between my shelves. I would say overall this grinder is quite nice, easy to use, and a great grind size for my espresso.

"I love skirts, but I especially love this skirt. This skirt is made from an extremely soft fabric. It is stretchy also. It is 95% rayon, 5% spandex. This combination produces a fairly thin, lightweight fabric. I would not say this is a particularly dressy skirt, but it is an amazingly comfortable skirt. I wear it around the house a lot. My husband loves it. It has a comfortable stretchy waistband that reminds me of yoga pants or lounge pants. I live in the South so the thin light fabric is much appreciated. I need all the help keeping cool that I can get, so this light skirt is perfect for summer. It will be fine even in the fall and winter because it is still fairly warm here. The skirt has slits up both sides. These slits go up pretty high, but not so high that I feel uncomfortable or like I am showing too much leg.
I ordered this skirt in a medium, which fits great. I usually wear a medium. I am about 56.5 tall and 135 pounds. The waistband fits really well. It is so comfortable. The butt area is my least favorite, because of the thinness of the skirt. It will show panty lines depending on the underwear you are wearing. The length is great. It comes just past the bottom of my knees. Overall, I like this skirt a lot. I wear it often. My husband thinks it looks great on me.

"I did get a size larger, as I read in the reviews that it ran small.

It fits perfectly except for my boobs. My books
Look HUGE in it, because the cups are padded and push up.

I am giving this five stars because I could tell immediately that the product was high-quality. The colors are bright and vibrant, the fabric is strong and I know it will last a while, and the straps are sturdy and not feeble like most bathing suit straps are.

I might not Recommend this for someone with big boobs. I am 140 lbs and 5'2- I got a size 10. My boobs are DD. I will still wear this because it's beautiful. I'll just wear it around closest friends and not at My daughter's swim lessons, Ha!!

"For this UTG red/green dot sight knock-off, I took it out to the range today and shot 80 rounds .223 with it. I didn't make any windage/elevation adjustment because I had it co-witnessed with the iron sights at home. It held zero even after I removed it and mount it back on.
It is almost identical to the UTG one, except it has no logo. UTG costs $30, which is extremely cheap for a red dot. This knock-off costs only $18.99!!!

At first, I have a very low expectation for it. I tested the red/green dot illumination both indoor and at low light situation. Both red/green dot seems to be fuzzy, you can see the ""hair"" growing around the dot. The 5 illumination setting for the green dot is indistinguishable, except for the lowest and highest setting. The red dot is better, but it's brighter than the green dot in every setting. I find that the best setting for indoor and low light is: either red or green dot at their lowest setting.

To my surprise, in the bright daylight, both red/green displayed a perfect rounded dot. The green dot is visible but not really eye-catching even with its highest setting. The red dot at its highest setting works great, but not anything below that.

Overall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. Although it claimed to be a 4 MOA dot, somehow I feel it's much better than that. I was shooting a 2"" group at 50 yards. I got consistent hits on the steel targets at both 200 and 300 yards. It makes shooting so much easier than using the iron sights.",0

"This is a cute case! I loved the idea of the wood pattern, but I was skeptical about how I'd like it in real life. I thought it might look really cheesy and plastic-y. I really like it! The case is hard, but has sort of a softish, rubbery feel to it. The bottom section is solid black. The top is wood grain and I think it looks pretty realistic for something that isn't actually wood! An unusual feature of this case is the circle in the center. When the laptop is off or closed, it makes for a simple design. The circle is comprised of rows upon rows of teeny holes. When the laptop is on, the circle allows the Apple logo to shine through. This case also comes with a screen protector. It seemed pretty easy to apply. Once in a while I notice there are a few air bubbles if I have the screen at certain angles, but they are mostly unnoticeable. (And I put it on today, so they may possibly work themselves out.) It also comes with a clear keyboard protector. This fits perfectly over the keys. This review is literally the first thing I'm typing with it on. It feels a little funny- I type over 100 words per minute, and it's throwing me off just a bit. However, I feel like the longer I have it on, the more it will meld into the keys, and that I'll probably get used to the different feel pretty quickly. (And even if I didn't, it would be wort it to know that I'm not getting crumbs or coffee down into the computer!)  I received this item free or at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.",1

"Let me start out by saying I am a big fan of paracord projects. When I saw this product the first thing I liked was all the extras available in the clip. To have a small knife, whistle, and firestarter kit in the clip seemed like a very good idea. Most survivalist and hikers are either minimalist or very utilitarian about what they carry.

Basically if it's too big or bulky to carry you just won't do it. If it doesn't serve multiple purposes you won't carry it because that weight and space could be used for something more useful.

I like this bracelet. The whistle is loud and the other extras work well. The braid used is standard, but as such is time consuming to take off. I prefer quick draw or release braids and if I was to carry this I would change the braid.

I am not going to be wearing this, but it's no fault of the maker. I have small wrists and small hands. This clip with all the extras is just too big and obtrusive on my wrist. I will turn this into a backpack clip or something else and wear a less bulky bracelet for normal wear.

"I have two large dogs that love to ride in the car. I had been searching for a good dog seat cover so ordered the Dog Seat Cover - Premium Quality Waterproof Hammock - Pet Seat Cover for Cars with Headrest - 2 Colors.
It is easy to install, simply tighten the straps around the headrests. It is machine washable which is a big plus, or when you wash your car, you can vacuum it.
The fabric is quilted which makes it a little more heavy duty than the last one I tried. This comes in a nice little carrying case. I was really impressed with the quality.
This also included a free squeaky toy, but it is way too little for my big mutts. Ill have to find a small puppy to gift it to. I am so glad I got this seat cover. I definitely recommend it if you have dogs who like to ride in cars.

"**UPDATE 09/2016: Still loving my case! It does have a few minor cracks in places now but is otherwise working well to protect the computer from scratches, etc. And I *love* the color still  so pretty and bright.**

First off, read the directions if you are having any trouble snapping this on to your MacBook (I *may* have neglected this at first). I purchased a similar case for my laptop back in January from a different seller. My previous case has a slick surface while this one has a soft touch  so far, I think I'll prefer the soft touch.

PROS
 The soft touch surface feels nice
 Easy to attach
 Fits well
 Color is as shown (love it!)
 Shows the Apple logo while the laptop is open

CONS
 Has a couple of sharp edges
 One of the foot pads was off center (I did push it almost back to the center)

My iBenzer case only lasted 4 months before it began to crack, and my laptop is very well taken care of and only used by me. I'll post any updates with cracks, damage, or other problems if they arise with this case cover. Overall, I think it is a good product for the price, especially compared to the iBenzer one (I paid ~$22 for the other one). I received this case cover for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I'm not required to leave a positive review and was not compensated.",1

"This works great! It provides a great amount of light to add some ambience to your patio. It has the bigger lights that point down and the perimeter lights that point more at an angle, so it lights up a good amount of area. It fits really easily onto the umbrealla. It has a latch to pull the pieces apart on one side and a hinge on the other. It opens up plenty wide to fit around the umbrella pole. It has adjustable pieces pinside the circle to hold onto the umbrella and adjust to the size of the umbrella pole. I love being able to sit outside with this light. It takes 4 AA batteries. I've used it a decent amount so far and they seem to be lasting. It has the options of which lights you want to use, which is very useful as well. You can do all the lights, the outer circle, or just the 4 big lights. Sometimes it's nice just to have the outer circle lights becuase I don't need that much light. I have been really enjoying it so far and am very happy with it!

"think that this ESR iPhone 6s Case is well designed. It is nice that this is a dual-layer case because unlike many hard cover cases without any TPU material, this case was very easy to put on and also to take off, and unlike many TPU cases that only offer minimal protection, this case seems to provide a lot better drop protection. This case stands out in that there is a front cover which wraps around the phone, providing excellent protection not only at the sides and edges, but also the front if the phone were to be dropped and landed flat on its front.  It is also relatively slim for a heavy duty rugged case. I also really like the smooth texture of the back of the case. Everything about this case has been very much to my liking thus far, and based on the corner, this case seems pretty good at absorbing shock, although I would personally have no good way to measure this. The case is pretty smooth, but not so much that it is hard to grip making it more prone to slips and drops. It also doesn't provide so much grip that it is uncomfortable to hold or will get caught when pulling out of the pockets. Overall, I would recommend this case and I am rating it at 5 stars as I believe most other companies would sell such a case at around $20 to $40. So, at the current price of around $18, I think the value of this case exceeds its cost and I would still rate it at 5 stars even if it were priced at anything below $25.

I was provided this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I know how important reviews are to potential buyers as I, myself, always read reviews for online products before making a purchase.

"I was looking for the perfect cover up dress to wear to the pool.  I have a trip coming up for the beach and was looking for a couple of new cover ups. Im 58 and 140lbs and I ordered the small in the black color.  Its a loose fitting style and it fits me perfectly.  I actually was looking for something that wasn't too clingy.  The fabric is nice and stretchy and very comfortable.  It dries pretty quickly over a wet suit.

  This could be worn as a night gown, but I would have to wear a camisole under it because the way it fits me, it exposes a little too much to be a mom family friendly night gown.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",1
"Got these nice headphones for my morning runs. Charge time took about 1hr and so far its lasting for 5 days straight without a charge ( my runs are about 30-40 mins). These keep out the sweat and the headphones come with different ear pieces to adapt to your needs. The magnetic connections work but if you throw this in a gym bag they will mostly come apart. Phone calls come in clear and ppl seem to hear me ok. The noise canceling feature does the job for the most part all you hear is your music but I have heard clearer and better from others but at this price its not bad at all.

"I purchased the Silicon Devices Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds for Running - Sports Sweatproof Workout Headphones on March 15, 2016 and received them on March 17, 2016. The headphones were a set that I purchased out of necessity and I thought they sounded amazing. I ordered them and they worked great for less than two months. At the beginning of May the headphones started to give me problems. Now being someone that followed the charging instructions to a tee, I was frustrated when they would no longer charge or tell me they were charged. So I went to my instruction book and tried to resolve the issue. I tried to wait for 30 mins to see if the light would return and it did not. I tried to reset to factory default following the instructions and this failed me as well. I did see before purchasing them that some people were given a free set for a good review or something, but I took it with a grain of salt. Now I wonder if that is true. These headphones were right under $50.00 and cannot even last two months. It is ridiculous. I am someone that goes to the gym daily and for 2-4 hours a each day and they were great until they died. I am more than disappointed in this purchase. I am outright pissed. No one should buy these headphones if they are only going to work for such a limited amount of time.",1
"I have tried several other ""similar"" products, but this one outperformed them all.

Extremely strong hold...I use one of these on my motorcycle and have NEVER had an issue of the phone moving around or coming off the mount. Once it is on there it sticks and stays. This has, by far, the strongest magnet of any of the other ""similar"" products out there.

Easy to position...I can move the phone where I want it to be (angle and inclination) easily, yet the one in my truck holds my phone in place even when I am off-roading. Easily viewed and adjusted if needed.

Looks great when not in use...it's not intrusive like so many phone holders are. When the phone is not attached to it, it just blends in on both my motorcycle and my truck. It doesn't look out of place or gaudy, yet it's there when I want it.

Doesn't make my phone look ugly...so many of the other phone holders look huge, take up dash or windshield space, or makes your phone twice it's normal size. The small, nicely designed phone attachments don't affect the look or function of my phone. It looks like a decorative sticker.

I'm going back to purchase two more of these for other vehicles. I'd recommend them to anyone looking to put a phone in your car and not have everyone know that you have a phone mount in your car. Motorcycle placement works as well.

"BRIGHT.  Love it.  Roommate rode behind me one night with the 500.  I was just using a wally world aaa battery headlight.  I couldn't see the road in front of me bc of my shadow from his light even with my light on.  Bought me a 500 the next time in bike shop.  Lost it, got another and bought this 850 a while later.  850 is definitely brighter and removable battery seems to be a plus.  Haven't gotten a second battery to try that function out yet.
  With the 500 I seemed to get 3-4 days without charging if I spaced on it.  Same can be said for this 850.
  I use my 850 every day.  No problems.  I have had cars flash brights at me.  Walkers/joggers have commented on brightness.  Also if a car is blinding me with brights on a dark road, a quick cycle through the diffent modes landing on my brightest tends to get message across.  Not pointing it at them but just pedaling on.

  Again, just a different world for brightness if all you are used to is a, aa, aaa, c or d batery lights.  put my old mag lite to shame from the get for broad field illumination.  and after a few hours of continuous use the mag was dead and the 850 on its brightest had just started to noticably fade.",0
"I bought this compression bag for my niece's sleeping bag or blanket who is going to have her yearly camping and thought this would be a nice gesture to send her off. Well, she appreciate it and thank me happily because she have more room to put for her other stuff in her camping back pack. She said that her sleeping blanket were nicely fit inside. Her sleeping bag is not bulky and big that compression bag still have room for her towels. She also said that it looks pretty sturdy and have held up well so far. It may ripped the bag or broke the plastic buckles depends on how strong you compress your stuff in the bag and how thick it is. It said that it is waterproof but the closure is only drawstring and no cover on it. Straps were annoying at first but she rightly put things later. There is no odd smell to the bag and it is also easy to clean it up. Despite of some flaws, my niece is still pleased with the compression bag. It is pretty decent for the price.

"Great Charger! I am a college student so it is always good to be carrying an extra in my backpack! Length is great, and seems to be built better then the apple charger as it is thicker.

I surprised my wife by getting these and it was definitely a happy surprise because she loves the way they feel also. I bought them about 3 weeks ago so I have changed the bedding a few times and these are by far our favorite. They hold their shape perfectly after multiple washes and I haven't seen any signs of color fading. I have received the product for free or at a discount but my opinion is my own.

"It's always a little challenging ordering clothing online since we can't try the item on. I wear a size 6 dress so I went with the XL. I was happy with it save that it definitely suits women with a larger bust size than I have (I'm a C cup). It's very soft and very comfortable but with a ruched style that's great for those of us with a softer tummy, it does a great job of disguising mine.

My suggestion is that if you're smaller of bust you order a size down for a snugger fit through the chest. Otherwise it's a cute top that pairs well with jeans for day or dresses up with a pencil skirt for evening.

While working on a project with a friend, he pulled out a bit that allowed you to auger the stripped head, and then use the other side extract the stripped bolt.  In a few short minutes he had it removed and we were back in business.  I knew I had to had to get a set of these!

This set looked really nice because it came with multiple sizes.  Unfortunately the instructions were very poor so I was left to guess which size to use on my initial trial.  The plastic case that the bits come in is very poorly made and is practically garbage.  I guess this is a case of you get what you pay for.

I began my trial of my new toy/tool by locating a stripped screw in one of my shop electrical boxes.  As you can see in the video, my attempts to remove the screw with my philips bit did not work whatsoever.  Considering the screw was rather small, I decided to go with the smallest of the easy out bits.  Later I would try some of the other sizes as I did not have much luck with the smallest.

I labored for about 15 minutes using the easy out bits trying to remove the stripped screw, and unfortunately I had no luck.  I guess I could chalk this up to operator error, but I am a pretty skilled handy man and I cant imagine I missed anything amazingly important. If someone has some important operations details I am missing, please feel free to share.  When I moved up in size to the 2nd bit, after a few seconds the bit began to smoke and I immediately ceased augering.  As you can see in my picture, the metal on the auger bit did not fair so well.  In this situation, it appears that the metal of the screw was harder than the metal on the bit.  Not at all what you want in this situation.

Due to the fact that the product did not successfully do its job, and the poor quality of the instructions, case, and hardness of the metal, I can only give this one star.  Next time I run into a stripped screw I will give this a try, but I don't have much hope that the results will be different.

"#highquality

I have had this case on my phone for a bit now & really like it. It is super light, and think. It's a great case if want to keep their phone thin & light. There is plenty room for putting a charger in it, also headphones. It's a little hard to turn the volume on and off but that's not a huge deal.

The design of the case in general makes the case worth it. An aluminum case lined with a TPU layer on the inside while keeping the thin dimension of the iPhone6 is amazing. Having the choice to remove the plastic backing is also great and gives the option of using it as a regular case or bumper case. I thought it would a cute idea to put a pic between the clear backing and the phone and it works out really well. (As long as the paper isn't too thick)

"This aux cord works fine and it is awesome to see that there are added springs on the connectors, giving it more life. I am partly skeptical for how long it will last due to the reason that it is very thin, but feel a bit better with the added springs. If it was thicker, this product wouldve been perfect. The part that brings it back to five stars is because it has a lifetime warranty which really makes this a solid purchase for an aux cord.

"A month ago while I was at a local park with my dog I saw a dog in a passing car with a pair of Doggles on. I never knew such a thing existed and thought I had to buy one for my Lab as he loves riding in the car.

After putting them on my dog, I realized that Doggles and him weren't meant to be. He immediately started pawing at them to try to get them off and they came off very easily. I would like to see a better way to secure them to a dog's head. If he was riding in the car the Doggles would have been long gone. I also would have expected these to be made out of better quality materials. These Doggles are made from cheap plastic and elastic with no clasp to keep the sizing in place on the dog's head.

Fortunately my sister has a Goldendoodle that equally loves accessories and riding in the car. She has quickly fallen in love with her new eyewear. These aren't for every dog, so be sure you know your pup before you buy them. You may also have to train your dog to accept these.

"Love these. My daughter has an ipod and she is constantly messing up the screen. I love that I now have a 5 pack just waiting for her to mess it up. Much more financially sound to buy a multi pack for her. Each one comes with a sheet of dust removers, an alcohol wipe and a microfiber cloth to prepare the original screen for your new screen. I was very happy to see that they don't rely on you to reuse all the old products each time you need a new screen protector.

Glass screen protectors are so much better than the old plastic screen protectors. It's like having a much stronger original glass rather than a screen protector. You don't even notice it's there.

"Beautiful lights! It is a very decorative, cozy appealing light.  10 ft is plenty of length to stuff in a jar to create a firefly type look.

And the battery life has been excellent so far.  I haave run both of the lights for 15+hr and have not experienced any battery degradation.

"Excellent screen. The quality is greater then what I initially expected from this type of product. The netting feels heavy and durable and there is a strong band of reinforcement around the outer perimeter and inner flaps. It looks as if it can handle lots of use without premature fraying.

There is one negative that wish I had considered before purchasing though...the magnets will stick to my metal door. This isn't a problem when walking out, but can be when walking in. This product is great for the people in your household that forget to close the door and let bugs in, but it loses some of its advantage when some of the screen remains open because of a metal door.  There are lots of magnetic screen door mesh products out there so this issue can't be specific to this brand. If you have wooden door, you'll be 100% okay.

It still deserves 4 stars since at least most of the doorway remains blocked off from flying intruders. As far as installation goes, I was able to do this on my own in about 30 min, including the time it took for me to clean the doorway in prep.

"This is a really cute cast iron trivet. It is nice and heavy and has a lot of great detail. This trivet has excellent craftsmanship, and looks beautiful in my kitchen. I have a beautiful cast iron tea pot that I sit on this trivet when I am using it. Not only does this apple trivet look good just sitting on your stove top when not in use, but you can hang this on the wall when you are not using it and it looks good there too.
Make sure that you take care of this beauty by drying it completely after each use to ensure it stays dry. If you leave it wet, it can cause rusting. As long as you take good care of this cast iron trivet, you are going to have it for the rest of your life. I would recommend this to anyone that likes cast iron, or is looking to try it out. I am going to buy another one of these for a friend of mine she is a cast iron freak! I absolutely love this product.
The reason I give the four star review rather than a five star review is because the rubber legs are difficult to keep on. In an effort to fix this I just placed a bit of super glue in hem and it seems to be working just fine.

"I received my Green Earth pan two days ago and I can't say enough about it - I LOVE IT! I received this pan as part of a free promotion and was pretty skeptical until it arrived. A few things I noticed right away:  1. It is BEAUTIFUL; 2. IT is very well made. 3. It is ceramic, but they leave out many of the harmful and toxic chemicals usually used to coat pans. 4. IT comes with an ""Ozeri Pan Protector"" (see in pictures), which I think is a brilliant idea, since I do stack and often times, scratch up my pans. After gently cleansing it and ""seasoning"" it (I used coconut oil) the first time, it was ready for the first test:  pan seared salmon. I used hardly any oil at all - and in all honesty, didn't even need ANY! The only reason I added a little oil is because I coated the salmon in a bit of gluten free flour so I could see how the ""browning"" potential would stack up to my iron skillets. It cooked beautifully, and at a lower heat than I normally use. The pictures show a progression of the cooking, including the white wine/lemon juice/garlic/butter reduction sauce I made the go over the fish. NOTHING stuck, not one single thing. When I was done, I wiped it clean using no soap and very little water. The next test was the following morning with eggs. I scrambled two eggs for breakfast, using NO oil at all - and NOTHING stuck... they were cooked to perfection and I simply wiped the pan clean. I can tell you that this will be one of my very favorite new kitchen tools and I highly recommend this purchase.",1
"I purchased this  GBB Wireless Bluetooth 4.0 Silicone Speaker not being aware of how great of a product I was getting.  The sound quality is awesome.  Clear/ crisp bass...small and powerful.  It's small enough to carry around, weighs about a pound.  Extraordinary sturdy.  The covering is a non-issue slip rubberized material, guess to avoid sliding if set somewhere on a incline.  Carrying handle attachment.  Fully charging took about 2 hours and lasted up to 6 hours. Great quality.  Paired with my iPhone 6s plus with no problems./ Universal Compatibility,  Hands free calling with built in microphone,  Water-resistant  ( NOT immersed in water) , Dust-proof,  Anti-scratch ,  Shockproof ,  1 yr warranty included.

This is a package of 30 individual foam flower heads. They are a beautiful shade of light blue and arrived in very good shape and seem like they will retain their shape well and not be easily crushed or crinkled.  They will be perfect for a bridal shower or baby shower.  Very pretty on top of cupcakes or as decorations. The flowers I received were only slightly over 2 inches across. I thought I would mention this in case it is important to someone that they be 3 inches. They are beautiful though and I will be purchasing more in different colors. I received a discount on the purchase price in exchange for my honest opinion/review.,1
Works great for shredding documents. It seems to get very bogged down if you put more than 3-4 sheets in at a time. So I don't know if it's quite as powerful as it's advertised. It does the job but at a slower pace.,0
"This skirt is really cute, but unfortunately runs quite small. I am usually a size four and for some reason,the medium runs really small on me (definitely stretches though, but I do not like the look that the stretching gives around the butt area). That said, the pattern of the skirt is cute, and if carefully washed in a garment bag, will not be destroyed in a washing machine (as long as you do not have bras or anything with hooks that may snag the lace). The materials are basic, but not entirely flimsy as it is lined, which I like. (The lace sits on top of the navy blue lining).

I got this because I keep forgetting to take my charging box. Is is small and fits in my purse easily. I love that I now have power anytime I need it. It is great for work or day trips. It offers a quick charge. No matter where I am I can charge my phone. I love the peace of mind of knowing my phone will never die.,0
"I use these under a motorcycle helmet.  Fit inside fine with no pressure.  Motorcycle riding without ear plugs is deafening (literally) and can cause permanent hearing loss.  Traditional expanding foam ear plugs are dangerous and completely isolate you from important sounds.  These filter the constant noise (wind) and maintain changing sounds (music, traffic, etc.).  You will notice that the filtered sounds are more low frequency so your music will have more treble and less bass.  They also work without music or phone/ipod plugged in.  The foam tips are the first that stay in my larger of two asymmetric external auditory canals.",0

"I received a sample bulb in exchange for an honest test and review of the product.  You can see right out of the box that these are great quality bulbs.  I have one corner in my home that no matter what you do, it's always a dark corner.  This particular light bulb really put light into that corner.  There is little hesitation when you turn the lamp on, where as I noticed with our regular light bulbs, there could sometimes be that flicker and then it comes on.  I'm not a lighting expert, but that irritates me extremely and so having this bulb for the past month and it doesn't do that, will make me replace all the bulbs in my house with these.  Again, I was fortunate to have received a sample complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

"If you have seen my other reviews you know I have had my fair share of glass screen protectors for my Samsung S7 edge and most of them end up with drastic failure to impress at all. The shatterguardz tempered glass screen protector is by far the best one I have used to date and here is why. There is adhesive all the way around the glass, not just on the top and bottom like some of the cheap Chinese ones.  The protector is all glass so there are no color choices, I like this better because it looks nicer on the phone in my opinion. When all is said and done it also fit the best, not perfect but the best. Installation was easy and the tempered glass felt secure. There is still some space between the tempered glass and the screen on the S7 edge but its not so bad that I hated using the protector. The worst part, a case just will not work with the tempered glass on the screen. For those of you looking to use tempered glass on the S7 edge AND a case, it will not happen! I have even tried the expensive Zagg tempered glass for the edge, no dice.

"These were smaller than expected and one of it came chipped on the edges. What is good about it is that they make a good addition to my altar and crystal pyramid since they are tiny and the colors are very rich. I just wished that the gold engravings were more defined looking as seen in the photos. I can hardly see the engravings on the peachy yellow one. Also they are not centered in the middle and some of them are running towards the edge. Although the engravings are poor quality, I think these are real stones and the details are very beautiful. I would recommend getting raw unrefined stones if you are looking for chakra stones. I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review.",1

It is supported by Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, 2000, ME, Mac OS 9.0, or later, and Mac OS 10.1 or later.

USBs are a great way to store and transferr data, like documents, songs, and pictures. They make it very easy to share our content with everyone.

This is one nicely made case. It is very strong and made very well. The red is really bright and looks super nice. It is made of a really nice mix of tpu rubber and plastic. The kickstand is a nice feature especially for a person like me who watches lots of videos on the phone. The phone fits in perfectly and installing it was a breeze. The holster feels very strong and i like that the phone can attach to the holster on both sides. The case has the indents to attach to the holster on both sides.

"This is such a sharp looking leash. I was using a nylon one for my cat, but she keeps chewing through them. As in, this is our third leash this year because she chews the handle off. We do have a retractable leash, but it lives in our travel bag. This was bought to be the leash by the door. The one we jiggle when its walk time.

So it's a beautiful leather. I got the smaller size in brown and it's a gorgeous deep brown shade. It's also a good size for my cat, though she's kind of big at 12lbs. That means it should be great for small to medium dogs as well! Everything feels sturdy and well made, and I foresee this lasting ages. Seriously. She's not about to chew through the thing, I hope, and the hardware is all nice. Its also the perfect length for us.

Note- The leash I got had no stitching. From the image, it seems like the brown and dark brown don't. I was expecting this, and its what I wanted. It looks like the light brown might have stitching, though?

"Good shrink wrap. I have to wrap several packages a week, plus I am planing another move again soon. I purchase for use in both capacities. The shrink wrap is good stuff. It sticks to itself, just like it is suppose to. It does the job!

 You get 1000 ft for the price. It's a good value.

There's nothing like shrink wrap to keep the lids on bankers boxes or add a nice finishing touch  to a package. It's nice to have on hand in the middle of a move. If something starts cooking apart, just wrap it up in this stuff and keep moving. If you are planing a move, grab some! You won't be sorry!

Bottom line:
I would buy again, I would recommend to family and friends to purchase.

"This window cover/film is really a great product.  Its amazing how much a little change can transform a room.  I had no problem putting it on (except peeling off the backing from the film, as I don't have long fingernails).  But in all honesty, that was a minor inconvenience.  Once I removed the backing, it went on beautifully and without a hitch.  Cutting the correct size was a breeze as all I had to do was pretty much follow the lines/square design for a perfect and straight cut.
When the sun shines through, I really like the rainbow of colors that each square produces.  Its really quite lovely.  Its almost hard to believe that its a screen and not part of the window.
Im really impressed with this product and will be buying another one for another window in the house.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  Thank you!",1
"I am so pleased with my new case!! I love the feel to the case, it really does help me to hold onto it better!! One thing I noticed, the holes are a little bit larger, which is fantastic. Alot of us women with larger fingers cant get our fingers in those tiny little factory case holes. This case makes is easy! It also ships lightning fast. I love the camo color, it seems to have a brightness to it, that I just adore. This case just seems to have a bit more quality put into it than the other cases I have had in the past, it is much firmer and the ends of my case are so shiny. They look polished. I will definitely recommend this case to others, Im very impressed. It fits like a glove, you dill feel a snap and you know your phone is not coming out of there, its slim design is nice also. They did not skimp on safety, very good case! I received this item free or reduced in exchange for a honest review, and I honestly can tell you guys, you won't feel sorry you bought it, its a quality, fantastic case!! Dont waste your time and money with cheaper more inferior products!! I truly expected to pay so very much more. You can just tell a difference with this case and cheaper cases. Look at them side by side, check the color and the strength of the case. Its hands down better than any case I have ever owned. When you pay so much for a phone, don't take any chances on cheaper cases that don't fit as well as these, and don't help you grip them. There are so many different types, colors, designs, and styles to choose from",1

"I got these leggings in the mail today, and immediately tried them on.  I am in love! They are form fitting, without being too tight or restricting. They stretch just the right amount. I didn't find them to be too hot, and I went outside when it's almost 100 degrees outside here and didn't feel as awful as some leggings make you feel by trapping in the heat. Good for outdoor yoga or hiking, etc. I think the color is really accurate to the pictures posted, and I really like the blue - I might need to get the other colors (not that I really need more leggings, but when you find a good style that you like, it's hard to pass up!). The fit is pretty standard, but they do have a nice amount of give. I'm usually a large, and these fit me great.

"I have always thought that a big part of enjoying a cocktail is presentation. I could make someone  the tastiest, fanciest cocktail but if served in a drab, and boring glass, it would take so much away from it. That's where this copper mule mug comes in, it's absolutely gorgeous and will make your drinks look extra fancy.

This is such a nice 16 ounce copper mule mug. I love that it is a solid, pure copper. It has no nickel, tin or stainless steel in it. I also love that is has a handle, which not only looks nice but makes drinking from it so easy. The advantage of using a copper mug for chilled drinks is that due to the metal, it keeps it cooler. Some say that drinking vodka tastes better in this type of cup. It seems to be of a high quality and is easy to clean up, just use a dishcloth and dish soap. Remember, these are not microwave safe.

Here's a good Moscow Mule drink recipe:
1 1/2 fluid ounces Vodka
1/2 fluid ounce Lime Juice
1/2 cup Ginger Beer
1 Lime wedge (garnish)
Ice Cubes
Mix together.

"Let me start by saying that TaoTronics (SunValleyTek) has, in the past, given me either a free or discounted product and asked me to review products honestly, but in this case, there was no free product or discount other than the one that was already in place for Amazon users.  So far every product I've reviewed for TaoTronics has exceeded expectations despite what I felt was a ""bargain basement price"" indicative of a cheaply made product.  I bought the TT-CD05 solely based on others reviews and at the current retail price.

Now... on to the review...

Packaging:  The TT-CD05 comes packaged in a nice, white box with a magnetic closure, enclosed in a cardboard sleeve bearing a color image of the product and prominent contact information for TaoTronics.  Opening the box you find the cam itself on the right and underneath the left side you find the mount and car and USB Data cables.  Some people have shown that there was also an SD card adapter that contained the 32GB microSD card that goes in the dashcam.  I was worried when I found no such thing, but further investigation showed that they may have forgone the adapter and started placing the memory card directly in the camera now.  I won't miss the SD adapter since I have more of those than I care to admit.  Overall the packaging was equivalent to that of retail, as you might find at Best Buy or any other electronics retailer.

Product:  The camera itself was easy to configure but I do recommend reading the manual or watching one of the already numerous demo videos out there for it.  I configured mine quickly and mounted it in the car with the supplied mount.  Using the mount, it does hang down some, but not near as much as I'd thought.  My windshield has the patterned black stuff in the top middle, but its flat enough that the suction cup stuck solid and has been so for two weeks now, hanging just below my rear-view mirror.  There's no noticeable shake at all in the mount and it's as if it's part of the windshield.  Getting the mount adjusted was more difficult because the ""notches"" that are used in the mount happen to be at either too low (too much hood) or too high (no visible hood) in my case.  I went with no visible hood.  The wide angle is excellent and captures the other cars in front and just to my front left and right very well.  In addition to what the camera captures, you get a look at the status of various settings like microphone status, current time and date, clip time (how much time is recorded in the current clip), lock status of the current clip and a few other settings.  The buttons are large and clicky with good positive feedback when you press them.  My only complaint, and it goes along with many other reviews, is that you simply can't see what the buttons are when using them.  They are pretty easy to remember, but it would be really nice to see them easily when reaching for them.  A fine point permanent marker run in the molded symbols on the buttons helps, but I won't be doing it to mine.  I've seen the question somewhere before asking if you can take a picture as you are recording video and the answer I saw was wrong.  You CAN indeed take a picture while recording video without stopping the video. The picture will be in the same widescreen format and not very high resolution but it will work.

GPS Add-On:  Included in my purchase, was the GPS receiver that attaches to the TT-CD05.  I'm not including my experience with that part in my rating of the TT-CD05 itself, as it is an add-on product.  I will however include my opinion of the device for those looking at it as an add-on and reading the TT-CD05 reviews.  The GPS receiver, while a cool concept and great add-on in theory, did not satisfy me.  From a ""cold start"" it takes anywhere from 5-10 minutes to get a satellite lock (EDITED: Previously I had experienced lock times of up to 20 minutes.  This has gotten better).  My morning commute is only about 25-30 minutes, and that means that for a huge portion of my morning commute, I'm not getting GPS data integrated into the video files.  If I'm going somewhere and do eventually get a lock, when I leave in an hour or so it will immediately get a lock again.  The GPS receiver comes with 3M tape and 2 additional 3M pads.  These are nice but I prefer not to have a permanent mount in my car since I want to be able to put the receiver in our family vehicle for long road trips.  I currently put the receiver at the top of my windshield where it can be held in place by the stiff, yet flexible headliner that comes down far enough to hold it against the windshield.  A better option to have included would probably be the gel adhesive pads that are washable and re-usable.  As for the software, it comes on a miniCD, which can be quite the inconvenience for those that have slot load drives or no drive at all.  Fortunately an alternative software (and much more feature rich in my opinion) called ""Registrator"" is provided as a free download on the TaoTronics website.  I highly recommend Registrator over the packaged software.  Unfortunately, I can't use either on my main PC since it runs Linux and I have yet to get either to run under WINE.  I did run it on my Windows tablet and it was great... when the video files had GPS data that is.  I believe there are other free software packages that run under Windows and Mac OS out there, but none for Linux, Android or iOS as far as I could find.  It's too bad because an Android app for reviewing the files would be ideal for me.

TL:DR - Excellent camera, Mount has stops that may be ""too high"" or ""too low"" for some but is stable as heck, GPS add-on is only worth it if you don't mind waiting 5-10 minutes (EDITED: Previously I had experienced lock times of up to 20 minutes.  This has gotten better) for a GPS lock from a cold start (several hours since your last GPS lock).",1

"This item is a clever combo charger and phone holder that also includes a voltage indicator. The arm on the phone holder can be twisted in the direction you desire and the phone mount can swivel around for the angle you prefer.

If you want a combo device like this that securely holds your phone then this charger is a cool device to have. I was provided a sample at no cost for my honest, unbiased review.",1
"I have two very hyper pups that love to move around the car whenever we have to take them somewhere. I spend most of the time trying to get one dog to stay in the back seat and the other not try to jump out of the window. I've purchased dog seat belts one time before, but the clip broke the second time we used it, so I kind of lost faith in them.
I LOVE THIS SEAT BELT! It is so durable, easy to use, and I love the bright red color!
There is a clip that attaches on the the dogs collar, and then a clip that goes in to the seat belt buckle. The strap is adjustable, so you can make it longer or shorter if you want to. I leave the seat belt a little long so that dogs can still move around a little bit, but now I don't have to worry about them jumping all around the car.

"I bought these labels to organize my pantry and to try and organize the kids playroom!  They are GREAT!  The perfect size to write whatever you need to write on them.  For the pantry, I'm putting them on mason jars, plastic containers with sugar, tea, flour, etc.  In the kids rooms, I plan to label all the bins so they can put their toys up in the proper place.  We seem to have a problem finding things in there...I'm hoping this will alleviate the problem.  The labels are a great size.  They are large enough to write more than one word, yet small enough to put on just about anything.  The labels are pretty thick.  They will last a while.  I used a chalk marker one one and decided I didn't like the way I wrote the work and washed it off with a wet paper towel easily.  It looks good as new!  Regular chalk will rub off too fast for what I want.  I'd recommend chalk markers or chalk crayons.  Either one of those will be great!  I received this set for a discount for my honest opinion.  I would buy these again in a heartbeat.  They are great quality labels for an awesome price!!",1

"The main reason for trying this product was to enable easy transfer of photos between friends on a trip. I usually struggle to transfer pics when I go on a trip with my friends and this little gadget has made my life super simple. I wasn't aware that a product like this was available that directly connects to IOS devices.

What's Supplied:
 16.0 GB Storage Stick (Though in typically the region of 14.7 when formatted using PC)
 No instructions which is why I had to take a star away

The first thing I did was install the U-Drive app ([...]) and plugged the flash drive into my iPhone. From here on out things are super simple. You can easily transfer files between phone and the drive using this app. To transfer it to another phone, it is super intuitive as long as both the phones have this app.

Pros:
 No internet data needed for transfers.
 Lightweight.
 Easy To Set Up (despite my earlier issues).
 Quick Image Transfer.

Cons:
 The speed can be quite slow at transferring video files.
 Using the Stick alongside a phone case is near impossible due to the adapter of both the Micro USB/Lightning being short in length.

I was very tempted to give this item 5 stars, but in fact Im going to settle for 4, and here are the two reasons why. Firstly, the U-Drive software is too primitive. You could argue that it doesnt need to do much, and while its got a very simple design, its not particularly powerful and there is quite a lot more that it could potentially do, but doesnt- for example automatically sync any photos that you took since the last time you plugged it on, or select files within a certain date range, or things like that. Theres a lot of unrealised potential there. Secondly, as mentioned before- no instructions with the product.

Besides my two concerns, I'm pleased with the product, now that I have it working properly, I have a place to keep my photo/video safe without the use of Internet and to transfer files easily. Overall this is a great product and would recommend it to those potential buyers. I was provided this flash drive in exchange for my unbiased opinion.",1

"This robe is very beautiful.  If you are like me I am not really fan of the traditional robe that you put on as soon as you get out of the shower they make me all hot and sweat terribly bad.  So once I saw this Kimono Robe on sale I knew it would be a great thing to try out.  I am the mother of two small little boys and staying covered up is important to me.  I thought that all the colors were really pretty, I went with the red and white one.  I made sure to look at the sizing chart which was very important I had to order a 2XL according to the measurements listed on the sizing chart.  I am so glad I did.  I normally wear a Medium or Large so I had to go up two to three sizes bigger than what I normally wear.  The 2XL fits although I wish it was bigger in the waist, but it will make due. It fit really well everywhere else so I imagine once I lose a bit more of my baby weight that it will fit even better. Once I put this robe on, getting out of the shower or just throwing it on to stay warm as I go downstairs to get the coffee started in the morning was a pleasure.  The fabric is very soft and silky. It glides over your body making it extremely comfortable and lightweight.  Once out of the shower and dryed off I could wear this Kimono Robe with out breaking a sweat or getting too hot while picking out clothes to wear for the day. My favorite thing about this robe is the comfort level it provides and how beautiful it is.  This robe also has the tie strip that you have to thread through the loops on the kimono robe itself and is very easy to do. It can be a sexy or casual just depending on what you are going for. I am glad I got this for me mainly so I can stay covered up around my little boys and still feel comfortable enough to hurry and answer the front door if someone all the sudden stops by.  I will be wearing this Kimono for many years to come.

"I have a couple of indoor antennas and wanted to try out an outdoor one. I happened to have the opportunity to review this antenna so I jumped on it.

The antenna is very sturdy and comes with a mount or can be mounted on an existing pole as seen on the images. It comes with a long cable and also a power supply. You can also hook up the USB power to your TV if your TV has a USB power supply built in. My TV does have a USB power supply, so that is how I hooked mine up.

Once I plugged it in, I immediately tuned my channels. There are two chanels that my indoor antennas get that are sometimes intermittent. They are channel 8 and channel 10. After using this antenna for a couple of days, these two channels seem to be stable now. I live about 35 miles from the nearest TV antenna in my area.

I would definitely recommend this outdoor antenna for people that are needing to get a stable connection. This product is well built and can probably withstand the elements for years to come. If I have any issues, I will update this review.

"This is one of my new favorite tops.  It is made of great quality material.  I love the criss-cross straps in the back.  The actual sleeves (IMO) are slightly shorter than the picture shows, but I am extremely happy with that.  I was hoping they would be more mid sleeve than 3/4 sleeve, just because I normally stay warm and don't need the extra bit keeping me warmer LOL  I fell in love with this top when I saw it online & was looking forward to buying it and I am glad that I did, I am very happy with it.  I will be wearing it on Monday to work and I know that I will be getting compliments on this as it is so very beautiful.  It is my fourth shirt that I have recently purchased out of this same line, Hot from Hollywood, and every shirt that I have purchased, I have been so happy with and have received so many compliments on.  This Women's Crew Neck 3/4 Sleeve Strappy Back Cut Out Flowy Loose Fit Tunic Top is so elegant, you can wear it with a pair of nice slacks, with leggings or a pair of jeans, whatever you choosy this shirt will look fabulous.
I received this tunic at a discounted price, for my honest review, to provide consumers such as myself with helpful information on purchases they are looking to make.  I have been in no way coerced for my positive review, my review is of my own free will.  I would gladly buy this shirt again in another color if available and I will continue to make purchases from the Hot from Hollywood line as they are beautiful and beautifully made garments.",1
"WHY YOU NEED A GHOSTBED IN YOUR LIFE.

It has an adorable logo.
It is 11 inches thick. Size matters.
101 Night Risk Free Sleep Trail  they ship it back for you free if you don't love it.
The cover unzips making it perfect for washing. (Great for allergy suffers)
It DOES NOT retain heat like other memory foam mattresses I have used.
GhostBeds have a cooling gel memory foam layer made with special foam to react with your body for cooler nights.
Free shipping and it comes right to your door. No salesmen or salesroom. (They make me twitch)
They have a 12 month flex pay options. (Mattresses start $495)
A GhostBed has a 20 year warranty. Thats a lot longer than a lot of other memory foam manufacturers.
It was like the universe sensed it was time to get rid of my old mattress. I was having trouble, make that a lot of trouble sleeping. I was dreading the warm weather because the memory foam mattress that I used to love and does pretty well in the winter, does not do as well during the summers here in IL. It absorbs the heat massively. You can literally feel the heat radiating from the mattress. I have fibro so its not great when I sink into the bed or cant move. I honestly need something more intuitive. We had been considering our options when I got a fantastic email from the CEO of GhostBed asking me if I wanted to test out a GhostBed. After reading the site and seeing that is has a cooling layer I jumped at the chance. Pretty fortuitous huh?
We let it breathe overnight on the dining room table and put it on the bed the next night. Funny story: My husband was so used to my pathetic mattress that the first night he slept on the GhostBed he fell off the bed. Its so plush and tall that he didn't sink into it like the other one!
So for quite a while my husband and I haven't been able to sleep in the same bed every night. He snores plus moves around a lot and so do I. Basically with my fibro and his flailing about, one of us ended up injured by the morning. I didn't like it, but we did what we needed to do to stay married. A lot of the problem was that my old mattress wasn't firm enough for him but I like a softer mattress. We slept on the GhostBed mattress for two weeks together and I am shocked to report there have been no incidents. Seriously. We haven't been snoring as bad and waking each other up moving around at all. The only issue we had was that he took my blanket but I don't think that had anything to do with the bed..  Its nice to be able to sleep in the same bed again.

WHY WE LOVED THE MATTRESS.

The mattress is firm enough for my husband, yet soft enough for me. It really does stay cool. I was skeptical. I have had a lot of products say they could keep me cool at night but this is the first to deliver on that promise. There was also NO SMELL. Foam mattresses are notorious for stinking to high heaven. The GhostBed bounces back really quick, I haven't noticed an indent problem at all like my other mattress. My old mattress would hold a persons shape for over a day and bounced back real slow.

Honestly I am shocked at how much I love this mattress. I have been sitting here trying to think of a good reason NOT to like it and I cant. Its the first mattress in my adult life that I have slept on without some form of egg crate foam or pillow topper. I don't need any extra support at all. My husband is happy that he no longer has to camp out on the couch! I am also happy because I am finally waking up without a lot of back pain or headaches. This is huge with fibro because headaches or backaches can last for days and are hard to get rid of. I don't rave about much or review things here on the website that I don't like so this bed is really that good. If you have any sort of chronic pain or back problems and cant afford the pricier mattresses, GhostBed is really something you should look into. Even if you CAN afford the pricier mattresses I think you should look at purchasing a GhostBed.

*side note: 4 months later I am still sleeping better than I ever have. I have not had any problems with the mattress and it's been a blessing in the summer. I don't review products online or Amazon unless I have a major complaint or I love them.

"I fell in love with canvas bags when I bought a smaller canvas crossbody for travel. I love the durability and the casual, comfortable look. When I saw this bag in a larger size and such fun colors I knew I wanted to try it!

I love that the bag can be worn as a shoulder purse or a crossbody. The leather straps do take some work to adjust because they are thick, but I attribute that to the quality and durability of the strap. The online pictures do a great job of showing what the body looks like as far as zippers and straps. There are two outside zippers for smaller items, and the inside is more or less one large compartment with two open pockets. Some people have mentioned they'd prefer more compartments, but this is a matter of preference. I actually like one large interior area as some of the things I carry our larger anyway. It's easily large enough inside to store a tablet or several books, which would be great for travel. It does not zip at the top, but rather has a button closure for easy access.

I debated on the grey or the coral, but since I wanted to brighten up my wardrobe I chose the coral. I'm so happy with my choice as since it's  canvas it's not too loud or bright, just a very pretty reddish color.

The only improvements I'd like to see is the way it sits when being worn, it doesn't stay ""wide"" as is shown in the picture, but sort of collapses in on itself; I've included pictures to show what I mean. If there were some sort of bottom or side support that wouldn't happen. It's not a big deal, but it does feel very bundled up when carrying only a few items.

I disclose that I was fortunate enough to receive a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review, but the opinions are my own and I only rate based on my experience. Overall, I love the color and style of this bag, and would recommend it especially when carrying large, bulky items.",1

"I'm not sure where to start with this guy.. I was excited to try this product out because often times I just want a quick cup of coffee without making a full pot in the French press -- dirtying the moka pot -- or the coffee maker. What a perfect solution! the portable press..

Well -- things quickly turned south. The packaging seems to indicate that the 'press' on a French press is for 'squishing the oils out of the coffee' for better aromatics and flavors. Unfortunately this isn't true. So what you end up with is a mesh grate with low permeability.

I was unable to get a good cup of coffee using this press. I filled it with coffee as directed and after 5 minutes of 'brewing' in 190 degree water I ended up having to press the plunger just to get some depth of color out of the grounds. I'm not sure I would even bother with this for making tea. The color in the picture is true to coffee -- but the flavor extracted overall was just not there. Consider this if you want a 5 minutes 'weak' cup of coffee with easy cleanup. If you're looking for a good 'backpackers brew' or travel companion -- stick to instant over this.

I received this product as a sample for my evaluative, honest candor and diligent review.

"So last week I received a pair of headphones from iSpecle in exchange of an honest review. No requirements for the review, wasn't even asked for a ""positive"" review. Just to review and give whatever I thought. Now, if you're like me this company is new to you. All I knew was that I was receiving headphones to review and was a bit anxious and excited. Excited, free headphones. Anxious, the quality could be terrible. However, thankfully that was not the case.
So to preface this, I'm not the best when it comes to describing audio. I'm still a newbie but I'm come a long way from where I once was. To put things into perspective for the rest of this review I will list the headphones (best/worst) I've used prior:
Worst: Generic Apple earphones, I don't know how people still use those.
Best: RHA MA350
iSpecle's bluetooth earphones are up there with the RHA. I was suprised when I first tried them because my only prior bluetooth earphones were the LG tone pro and while they did what I wanted them to do (use for workouts) it did it poorly both in terms of audio and working with them on. These earphones being only a wire really helps.
Again, I can't describe audio very well so I will say this: These earphones are interchangable with my RHA (Which I got after spending a lot of time hunting for best earphones under $50). I'd give a slight, very slight, edge to RHA in terms of audio quality but having bluetooth on the iSpecle ones are pushing them aside to be my new daily drivers. I've been using them constantly since friday and still haven't had to recharge. The only con I would say is the design of the handles (?). The red doesn't look the best too me but there are other color options and it's not something to lose a star over.

At 30, and even at 50, I can't think of any other earphone that rivals it WITH bluetooth.",1
"I play violin in a local volunteer orchestra. The orchestra is comprised of adults who are just learning and folks like me who grew up playing, almost became professionals, then changed course, but have now returned to play just for fun. We rehearse for several weeks, then go ""on tour"" around the community, playing in retirement homes and Alzheimer's units.

Sometimes, we play in locations where the lighting leaves a bit to be desired. For the most part, I do okay - I'm in my mid-40s and I can see the music without any difficulty. But my standmate is in his late 70s, and he struggles to see in the poor lighting locations. Several of our players use lights like this on their stands, and I finally decided to try one out so I can surprise my standmate this fall season.

Pros:
- Clip is strong, but not TOO strong, so no damage to the stand.
- Two different lighting settings - regular bright and bright bright - and each head can be on a different setting.
- Works with USB plug and/or AAA batteries
- Heads are super-flexible and adjustable.
- Works for music stands and books alike!

Cons:
- Plastic has a slightly cheap feel.
- Uses AAA batteries, which isn't ideal
- USB cable isn't super-long

I honestly don't have much negative to say about this product. I'm quite pleased with it, and I plan to use it quite a bit this fall season.

"This is the 8 mode version, but it's virtually identical in all other respects to the 2 mode version, which I also have and love to death.  These lights are  a gamechanger compared to big, clunky light strings with heavy, tangle-prone cables.  They're so light and agile that you can hang them anywhere without a second thought.  You can stick them in place with just a piece of masking tape if you want.  The LED chips are miniscule---like the size of small water droplets---they make even modern LED light strings look bulky in comparison.

The solar panel is responsive---I had enough stored power to operate these right out of the box with minimal charging in ambient light.  Operation is foolproof, there's only one main button to toggle through the modes.  The 2 mode version just has ""constant-ON"" and ""fast-BLINK.""  But with these you get a variety of effects.  I usually don't love blinking holiday lights, but these effects are pretty nice; I like the slow pulse and the twinkling star mode.

The solar panel and the lights all together barely take up any more space than a deck of playing cards---it's astonishing.  I'm thinking I might trade out all my old LED strings for a bunch of these tiny ones---they're so much easier to store and set up.  And they're much more versatile, too.  These lights are so small that you could easily pile then into a hurricane jar or wine bottle as a home decor element.  As long as they're near a window, you should be fine.

I think these are excellent---I'm really pleased with them, and plan to pick up more.

"This utensil holder frees up some much needed drawer space in my kitchen. It's large enough that it holds a considerable amount of my cooking utensils and makes them so much easier to reach and access when I'm in the midst of cooking and don't have a ton of time to scramble through a drawer searching. The holder is tall enough that I don't have stuff sticking way out but not so tall that they are falling down in either.  It's a decently weighted holder, but not so heavy you can't pick it up when you have it full. The only thing I am disappointed with is that when I pull a utensil out, the holder slides across my counter. The slick bottoms and slick counter top aren't a great combination for me personally because I'm afraid it's going to slide right off. To solve that I just used some felt furniture pads and stuck them on the bottom and viola it solved my problem, easing my worry of it sliding of the counter.

"Cavalone Women's Suede Leather Pointed Toe Ankle Booties...I order the 38, because I have worn the European sizes for years and was professionally fitted in a shoe store.  I am realistically a 7-7.5 on the smaller end of a 38, if that is the case for you order a 37.  I ordered a second pair in a 37 they fit nicely with socks, I haven't tried them with stockings yet.  I LOVE them!!!  The color is great and goes with anything.  The double zippers are a great advantage for getting the boots on/off quickly and the zippers work very well.

The boots are made of a nice soft leather with a nice attractive style that can be worn with most anything.  They have a nice heel height with out being to high and are comfortable to wear.

I would recommend these boots they are a great quality for the price.

"This belt definitely does make you sweat. It took awhile to get used to wearing it because it is a thick strap to have on you when you're exercising and already sweating pretty badly. It does fit every size waist, both man and woman very easily. It helps to have someone else help you put it on so it's tight enough to really work. I have enjoyed wearing it as a back brace after a long day at work. It's flexible enough to be comfortable but holds tight to give support. It does start to smell a lot and I was fine to put in the washing machine and let air dry. I washed it alone so the velcro wouldn't pull on any other items.",0
"I love dressing up for a night on the town but hadn't found a cute dress purse that I like. They all seem old fashioned or so small that they are useless. I got this one and I'm really glad that I did! I got the opportunity to carry it this weekend and it was just what I wanted, stylish and practical. I love how the zipper fastens down to the purse. It also has two different zippered inside pockets. I love that idea because I kept my lipstick away from other items that I wanted to separate. I had plenty of room for my cell phone and wallet. The quality is really nice as well and I got several compliments on how cute the purse was. I am very happy with this product!

"These pillow cases are so comfortable!  The white covers give your pillows a fresh, clean look.  I put them on these ""cooling pillows"" we have, and they worked great.

The material is very smooth and soft, but not silky (with silky pillow cases, my head seems to slide off).  These are my new favorites!",0
"A phone is a substantial investment. It's a fashion statement, it's an entertainer, its your lifelink to email, friends, fanily and your career, its an essential for day to day life. BUT it's also not very durable! One slip and the screen can crack. One time accidently throwing it into your purse or pocket and the screen can get scratched. God forbid if its stuck in with keys! A screen protector is essential!

A couple times a year  I like to replace my screen protector (due to dirt, grime, scratches). I look for protectors that are durable and offer good protection, are designed for my phone so there is no chance of coming up and are clear and easy to see the screen through. Its essential that the screen lets me still easily scroll and press buttons. I also need something that is easy to wipe down my phone gets dirty! Fingerprints, smudges, face sweat, makeup, etc  ick! I need to be able to easy wipe these things off.

This screen protector does all that for a very inexpensive price. It contours to the phone, is completely transparent and I can clean it without worrying. This product does exactly what it is expected to do and the install was very easy.

This is how I recommend applying: When you peel the first protective backing off the screen protector, make sure to keep it face down as you get ready to apply it. If it turns face up at all, it can catch dust. I applied it in about 2 minutes and it was super easy. If you do have bubbles once it is set in place, just gently smush them to the sides of the screen. Then remove the top protective film and smooth anything else as needed. Another hint, line up the thumb hole first, then be sure one side is straight. The rest will fall into place.

"This fryer is a thousand times better than the last compact fryer I owned.  Everything that touches oil is dishwasher safe so cleaning is so easy.  The oil filtration system is by far my favorite feature and makes clean up and re-use a breeze.  Also because of the filtration you don't get the taste of the prior foods cooked in the same oil.  The oil was well contained in the fryer and I did not experience any splatter or spillage.  Also I haven't had any issues with leaking unlike my last fryer.  The oil heated up very quickly and the special design of the plug kept it snuggly attached to the fryer (my last fryer constantly turned off mid-cooking because of the plug coming loose).
I have only three cons with this fryer.  One is that it feels too tall.  I wish it could be wider but more shallow because it sits only 6 inches below my upper cabinet.  Also stainless steel smudges very easily, as is expected with regular stainless.  Lastly, the numbers on the temperature dial are a little small and the Fahrenheit temperature increments are at strange numbers, like 356.
Overall, strongly recommend.
I received this fryer free in return for my honest and unbiased opinion.",1
"I got this because I run at night and also go walking with my dog at sunset and wanted a headlamp instead of a flashlight. I wanted to get something that wasn't heavy on my head. I also was attracted to this item because it is rechargeable and I travel a lot.
I love this color! It's great now for summer! It's my new fashion accessory! The adjustable band is a cool orange with greyish-brown-red abstract design with white logo. It is much nicer than it looks in the picture.
It is so easy to use and stays charged. One button to control the light which is great when you are running or have the dog on a leash and only one hand free! You can tilt the lamp up,change to strobe or dim with just one hand!
The one thing that is best about this is how light weight it is and without that strap going up the middle of your head like the other ones on the market.
I highly recommend this!-much better than expected!

"The kids lunch containers have been great. They are much sturdier than the others I have with 3 compartments. I love that this set comes with different color lids.

There is no confusion and each child gets the right lunch from the very beginning. The trays and lids fit well together and easy for the kids to handle. They don't bend or flex easily. We took them with us on a day trip in our cooler with sandwiches, pretzels, and a few grapes. Everything held up well and we saved some cash by not having to buy lunch for the kids.

"This V neck dress is okay. I typically wear an XXL and this seemed to be true to size. The length was a little bit too long for me with flip flops on. I'm 5'7"", so maxi dresses typically fit me just about right, so I was surprised with the extra length. I would not recommend this if you are any shorter than I am. If you're a taller woman, this would probably work great for you! The V in the front seems to V a little far for my tastes, however I am very busty, so this might not be a problem for others. I think that I would need to wear a camisole underneath to feel comfortable wearing this out.

The material is nice for summer. It's not so thin it's see through but thin enough that it's light enough to wear in the heat. I like that it has sleeves. It can be hard to find summer dresses that are not sleeveless, which I am not always too fond of wearing. I did wash this prior to wearing and it washed and dried with no problems. Sometimes cheaper clothes will shrink or the dye will run but this did neither, so I was impressed with that.

Overall, I think it's a great value for the price! I just wish it was a little bit shorter and didn't V quite so much. For someone else that doesn't mind the lower V and is a little bit taller this would be perfect!

The foot pump did its job this time, but I am not sure I have confidence in it lasting for an extended period of time if you have to inflate and deflate the ball multiple times. The instructions advise you not to over inflate the ball. The only way to tell if the ball is inflated properly is by measuring it. I am 5'10 250lbs and the ball held my weight without any issue. Thinking about it more, I would have probably gone to the next size up to have a little more surface area to work with. The exercises provided in the instructions are pretty basic and you can search online for more. I see myself using this quite a bit in my home gym, but as it is too early on, I can't determine yet the longevity of the product.

"Ive been gradually replacing all of my older Black & Decker 18V NiCd battery tools with the newer 20V lithium equivalents. I have several B&D Matrix system tools and also a hedge trimmer, string trimmer and blower. Using the old 18V tools, I found that I needed to have at least 3-4 batteries fully charged when I was doing my weekly outdoor trimming and cleanup. Unfortunately, many of the B&D tools don't come with a battery- at least not the ones I bought on sale for what seemed like a great price.  Well, it wasn't such a great deal when I discovered no battery, and about $50 to buy one! The lithium batteries do seem to have better runtime, but I wanted to have a couple of spares fully charged & ready to use, which is why I decided to try this Masione replacement.

When I received it, I charged the Masione 20V battery fully before using it. I only had time to do part of my outside work before it started raining, but I edged around my driveway and some of the garden areas and then used the blower to clean off the driveway. The battery still has some charge and seems to last at least as long as the original B&D one.

I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, but I am very satisfied with the Masione battery and would recommend it to my friends!",1
"I do a lot of high-impact exercise, and sports bras are so important to me that I wear them exclusively. Thus, I am always on the lookout for supportive, well-made, and comfortable sports bras that active people like me could live in.

This bra came almost three weeks earlier than the expected shipping date! However, the early shipping was not the only the pleasant surprise  this is one of the most comfortable bras I have worn!

A sewn-in tag states that the bras fabric content is 82% polyester and 18% spandex. The fabric is colorful and cool to the touch, and the seams and band do not chafe or feel too tight.

However, this bra has a few downsides: Firstly, the fabric is thin and not very supportive for high-impact exercise. It is too thin to be worn without the removable cups, and the cups don't stay in place. It isn't very flattering to have wrinkled sports bra cups, especially when you're trying to work out.
I suspect that the lower amount of support may also be because I tend to prefer wearing XS sports bras for the extra compression, but the sizes for this bra only go down to a size S. Oh well, sizes are all relative.

Overall, this is a fashionable, good quality bra, but some higher-impact support would make it even better.

"These boxer briefs fit well. I ordered a size large. Usually I wear a medium but I followed the sizing recommendation. The waist band is sturdy and doesn't roll over on itself. The material is very soft and has just the right amount of stretch. So far they have survived one washing in the machine without loose string or pilling. These fit as expected; giving support and movement. They will work well under your suit or skinny jeans. I haven't tried them during exercise but during regular daily wear they stay dry.

"this a great case and protects well.  The ports are easy to access and works with a wide variety of chargers as well as with tempered glass screen protectors.  I have already dropped this a few times and it has really protected my phone from damage.  I am not sure how high you can drop and still have it work but I dropped from pretty high and it still seemed to work well.  This is a great case and I would buy again.

"Love how this doesn't need a cord and is my favorite color, hot pink.  I tend to change up my room quite a bit depending on moods and this being cordless comes in handy.  It's also great for travel.  The numbers display is very bright and a simple click on the button lights it up LED lights.  This came with a manual, looks like Chinese manufacturer which is cool.  Manual very informative  I really loved how you could also set the month and day.  I am horrible with dates so find this very useful. I hate to rate this a 4 star and not a 5 star however my Celsius to Fahrenheit button did not work so I am giving it a 4 star.  I wish I had read to get triple A batteries and just so happened to of just bought some, not sure if that was forewarned or not.  Excited to take this on an upcoming camping expedition.

"I absolutely love the garlic peeler. It is so easy to use and it does an awesome job getting the skin to seperate. I like that this garlic press is also easy to use. It makes bigger chunks than a mincer but i am ok with that. I hated using old fashioned mincers and feel like they waste alot of garlic and make a big mess. Both the peeler and the press work great and are super easy to clean.

"I ordered the smaller size and it is a very compact indeed. The name does not lie almost surprisingly tiny I was expecting something a bit bigger but that's a good thing! I ordered this because I wanted something lightweight that I could take camping and to the gym and it would be easy to pack in a small bag or purse. It's a perfect size.

It's a soft material and has micro-fiber feel to it. It has a little loop on one corner of the towel to hang on a hook to dry. Looks like it is well constructed without any flas in manufacturing. It vary case is bigger and taller for this towl needs. The company probably used the bag for the larger size as well.

Drys skin off just as fast if not faster than a tradiations towl. And it really soaks up any moisture quickly. I like the soft feel it just glides along my skin. Easily dries my entire body no problem.

The only thing I noticed is it didn't come with any care instructions. Do I use hot or cool water to wash. Line dry or dryer?

"Love the colors in this cover up and  it is very light and flowy.  I don't care for it as a cover up because there are no arm holes.  It wears more like a shawl so if it is windy, the front or back blows over your arms.  The V-neck sat kind of high for me and it is a little short.  It makes a beautiful scarf though, so it is very versatile.  I am a plus size 18, 5'3"" so that can give you some idea how it lays on you.  It likely lays differently on someone that isn't plus.  If you don't mind no arm holes, I would recommend this because it is beautiful.

Was very pleased with the candles.  Will be perfect for the holidays,0
"I absolutely love buying any clothes items that are made for yoga. For one, they are so much more comfortable than regular work out clothes and always have a nice style to them. These socks are super cute! I love the design on the bottom which is the grips of the socks. They do the job well and also make the socks a bit more snazzy! The material is very soft and not itchy or uncomfortable. The fact that you get two pair is great so you don't need to worry about washing constantly. My only concern, which could very well be the way my toes are, is the area where the web of your toes are. The way the socks are made pushes down into that area if I have them pulled all the way on. It gets sore in between my toes and I have to take them off shortly after wearing. I still love them for my yoga routines and plan to continue the use of them!

The fit was perfect for me the Extra Large was long enough (as that is a concern for me as I'm 6,3 and L are too short and Extra Large are too wide) but this one kinda fit like an Large Tall.

Handy little bag for an item that I never thought I would need.  My husband is a baseball hat hoarder and while he has purged several time this year we still have about 20 hats (only 3 he wears typically :( ).  The problem is that the hats are dust collectors.  This solved our problem and keeps the hats in one place for the most part (no more asking me where they are).  This can now be stowed away in a closet or under the bed and pulled out when needed without hats getting ruined.  The quality of this bag is pretty good.  The bottom of it is a very cheap plastic and would tear easily but since this is just for baseball caps I think it is fine.  I currently have about 12 in the picture shown below and I definitely have room as my husband is certain to add to the collection.  **Please note that I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion**,1

"This is as expected. A young person probably won't need to, but I am a mature woman so may wear a tank top or camisole underneath it. As a size twelve with an ample bust, the medium fits fine, I am delighted to learn. It is a fine tunic for the price. Just remember the material isn't cotton so it won't breathe on a hot summer day.",0
"I bought these in the navy and  in a size XL. The sizing of these pants are no where close to anything that i have measured.

The length and inseam measurements are what is written in the seller's diagram so i know i am measuring correctly. Even with the 1-2"" difference it's still not coming out right. It is significantly smaller. Now when i actually put the pants on I was able to get them on but the thighs were tight and in the butt area. These pants are also quite long. Now normally this isn't a big deal and being 5'6 I am of average height. I think if it didn't have the slit down the side the pants wouldn't drag as much.

 I really like the style of these pants. I made attempts to try and exchange them however when i was able to get in touch with the seller they simply stated they did not have my size in the navy and to get a hold of Amazon for a refund. That's quite disappointing as I would have been willing to change the color in order to get my size. Thankfully returning to Amazon is not a hassle but they are being returned.

"This is a great quality hydration bladder backpack. You have a good capacity 2.5L hydration bladder on the inside and a nice sturdy 600D high density Nylon material backpack on the outside.

"Vintage Tankini Top Swimsuits Swimwear Two Piece Bathing Swimming Suits for Women & Girls
This is a cute bathing suit. I wasn't sure how it was going to fit me. I ordered a large, I normally wear a medium. The large fit perfectly. I love that the bottoms actually cover my butt and the underwear part doesn't keep going up, it actually stays in place. The top is very padded, for me it's great because I don't have big boobs anyway. I didn't really like wearing it as a dress because I felt my stomach looked bigger than it is.

"I purchased this product at a discounted price for my honest review.  I was not near as excited about this swimming suit once I opened it.  It's not bad, but definitely cuter in the picture than in person.  I was disappointed in the material. If it's stretched too much you can a lost see threw it because the material is really thin.  I also think that after a few wears and washes the material will start to look really worn.  I do really like the way the bottom fit because the sides have ties allowing you to make them higher or lower depending on your preference.  The legs do feel a little tight, pushing a little fat out which makes me uncomfortable.  Overall, it's not a great swimming suit but it's also not the worst swimming suit.",1

"I received this in today's mail and I could not wait to try it on! We're having some cool spring weather in my area and this is just perfect for that along with a nice cardigan.

The material is quite soft and stretchy. It fits well and it doesn't show bra straps or anything like that, as some sleeveless shirts will do. It looks great with a cardigan layered over the top of it and it flows nicely with the asymmetrical hemlines which are on the sweaters I have. I love the look of it!

"We LOVE these when we grill fish!! Fish always sticks to the grill and breaks up but these grill mats prevent that. I was really surprised on how well these work and love the fact that we can now grill fish more often.

 These mats are pretty big, we were able to fit several pieces of fish on one mat along with some vegetables. The fish cooks just as well as being directly on the grill but this way it doesn't stick, we don't lose pieces down into the coals, and it keeps the grill cleaner. There is no weird smell or taste when using these mats. Everything tastes delicious and juicy because the meat doesn't dry out like it does directly on the grill.

 Using these in the oven are awesome as well because it keeps food from dropping down and smoking. A lot of frozen pizzas say to put directly on the rack but crumbs always fall down and cause a smoky mess. These mats keep all the food in one place and keep the bottom of the food from burning.

 I received these grill mats for free for reviewing purposes. My review is based on my own personal use and opinions.",1

"We love the entire swim gear!  The cap and the goggle fit very nicely on my 5-year-old daughter.  The cap stayed on nicely and kept all her curly hair out of her face while swimming.  The cap is able to go over her ears, but she chose not to.  She hasn't complained about water getting in her eyes.  The goggle comes with a storage container which it is nice to have so that the goggle lens doesnt get scratch.  As of now, we have been using it for her swimming lessons.  The large drawstring bag is a plus for keeping all her swimming essentials in one place.  Honestly, we haven't needed to use the nose strips and ear plugs yet.

"Pros:
Very comfortable to hold and easy to use
Great for beginners or higher levels
lightweight and does not feel like it will tangle or get mangled after long use

swivel handles making it easy so it does not curl around itself or get tangled while jumping
comes with a carrying pouch making it easy to find in your gym bag

Cons:
can be a little too light for jumpers who are not familiar with speed ropes

Pretty good battery life from the 18650 battery.
Charge throughout the day and it should in almost all cases run throughout a night. 8-12 hours depending on how often it is triggered.

I suppose as stated it really depends on daylight exposure and how often the motion gets triggered but it seems to work well. Again not the brightest light on dim but it is nice and bright which helps to offer a little security.

"Perfect Sturdy and durable holder. This is an amazing rugged sturdy case which entailed four pieces for the most effective security.

I love the aqua trimmings and this can be used as a unisex case. The case is made for and LG G5 and it fits my LG G5 phone perfectly. The plus is the outer case portion which actually covers the whole front of the phone and locks onto the case itself so if my phone was to drop it would not hit the face glass of the phone and because also because it has a durable rubber outer case it will most likely bounce. This is a great sturdy case and i will recommend to all my family and friends to purchase. If you are looking for a full protection case this is it.

"Royale Direct Pets' tear stain removing is great for lessening the tear stains, not removing them completely, and giving a little color back. I've been using the product for over a week and it's been good so far. I've been using it on our pit and cat. Prior to the remover, I was using a wet towel or tissue. These methods only wipe the goop away and had little to no effect on removing the stains.

The tear remover has a clear appearance and a thin, watery consistency. It doesn't leave any sort of residue behind and it has a very mild unidentifiable smell.

Overall, I think it shows promise. I have my doubts it'll remove the stains completely, but at the very least, it lessens the appearance. Also, I haven't been using it daily. I've miss a day or two because my pets aren't always cooperative. Sometimes they're just reluctant, other days it's ""oh hell no!""

"My thoughts: This is a very pretty tunic. It is 100% cotton. They have multiple colors and sizes you can pick from. I got the navy one and it looks just like the picture. The stitching is done nicely and no hanging threads. The material is light and airy perfect for summer. You could wear this as a shirt, bathing suit cover etc. It is super comfy and very cute on. The details on the embroidery are done very nicely. The shoulders are a little narrow so if you are broad you might want to go up a size.

It has a side zipper if you need to open it a little and I like it has a elasticized smocked back which is great.

"These sunglasses are pretty cute. I enjoy the sleek design but they are very square. Since they are so square I am not too fond of the way they look on my face. I think they are a larger frame and the squareness they have isn't fitting to my oval face.

I believe they would look nice on any gender because of the style they are. I think that these are true to their retro style they are aiming for.

The item came well packaged but I was a little disappointed that a sample k-cup was not included. I was ready with a vanilla flavor to test this and it came out fine. For a single person or for someone who does not want to set up a full coffee maker, this is a good choice.",1
"This is a comfortable loose fitting women's bathing suit cover up. It is made out of 93% viscose, which is a type of rayon and 7% polyester. It is lightweight and soft so it does not hurt when putting it on after you have been at the lake, beach or swimming pool and you got a sunburn. This bathing suit cover up has a racerback and is slightly longer in the back than in the front. I am 5 ft 4 in and this cover up comes to about my mid thigh, which makes it look like a cute dress or a long shirt over shorts. This bathing suit cover up will look cute with any style bathing suit since it is loose and flowy. It is recommended to hand wash and line dry or lay flat to dry like I did. I think this cover up will be perfect for me when I take my kids to the water park or when I am swimming in my pool and need to go to the store for something.  I received this racerback swim suit cover up at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.",1
"This soap dispenser is a MUST have for any kitchen!  I really like that I can now get soap to wash my hands without contaminating the source, especially when Im dealing with raw meats. It operates quietly and efficiently.  You can adjust the amount of soap it dispenses and it works well with any foaming soap refills.  Im currently using  a cheap off brand antibacterial soap with no issues whatsoever!  You can set this unit on your countertop or mount it to the wall.  I imagine this would work really well in a bathroom too.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.",1

"I like this cap. Fits well for me and looks good. Someone said it felt flimsy. I wear a lot of caps and like the ones with a mesh liner to help support the shape better.. Mine had several threads popping out of the back just above the adjustment strap. I was worried that it might unravel around the hat. I used my lighter to burn off the loose threads and so far all is good.
 I did receive this at a discount for my honest opinion. Good, bad or ugly , I say it like it is. Thanks
Three stars because seller never got back to me.",1

"I ordered this tutu in the color rose pink for my 4 year-old daughter, and it fits her perfectly. It can also stretch to fit my 9 year-old, but its a little too short for her.

There's satin covering the stretchy waistband, so it's comfortable to wear. The length is perfect, and its such a pretty shade of pink. The tulle doesn't get tangled or bunchy, but I will definitely be hand washing this. My daughter wears this EVERYWHERE. Literally. The playground, the grocery store, to visit family. And to play dress up and pretend she's a ballerina. She loves this tutu so much and it's held up well.

I received this at no cost during a promotional period in exchange for my honest review.",1

"Where has this product been all my life?! When I received this product, I instantly opened my kitchen junk drawer and started testing all the batteries I've kept over the years that I wasn't sure of.

"For total transparency I was given this product to review. I hope this help somebody out there.

When I first opened the box and set things up I was in my home office and everything was setup and ready to go quickly and easily. I had a slight problem getting it working when I unplugged it and moved it to its final destination. After a quick search on how to reset it properly, which I basically deleted the device from my app and started fresh again and I have had no problems since.

It has a great feature that will send an alert to your phone the moment it detects motion. I have only used this feature very little because I am actually pointing my camera out a window to keep an eye on the exterior. So I shut that feature off because getting an alert every time the wind blows is a little too much.

I love that I can logon to the computer and see exactly what has happened by watching what the camera has recorded and uploaded to the cloud.

Overall, I am totally impressed by the camera. The picture quality is great and is working like a charm.

The only thing I wish is that I had an actual outdoor camera to review.",1

"So I have three kids under 6 who frequently use my phone for games, videos and apps. I had an otterbox but it was old and discolored and I saw this as an alternative for much cheaper and though I would give it a go! I am SO happy with it! The only difference I noticed was that this doesn't have port covers to keep dust out, everything else is pretty much identical to the otterbox. Of course my kids have dropped it several thousand times since I purchased it and not one single crack. Its really cute too and I love the kickstand feature.

"I received this 18 pack set of color gel ink pens for free to test and review.

A pen is pretty much a pen to me but there are some basic things I look for in a good pen. I have used all eighteen of these pens over the last week and here are my thoughts about the pens...

01 Is There A Good Color Selection? - You Betcha! This set has a nice selection of eighteen different colors.

02 Do the pens write? - You bet. In the past, I have purchased a box of pens that included dried out pens mixed among good pens. I'm not sure how that happens but since then I always check every pen. I checked all eighteen of these pens and they all write.

03 Do the pens write well? - The sure do. The pens write very smoothly and consistently produce a solid line.

04 Do they leak? - No way. I have only used each of the eighteen pens for 1-2 hours but I have not experience any leaking or ink dribble.

05 Can you refill these? - Yes these pens are refillable.

06 Are they a good value? - Yes they are a good value for six bucks. I checked around at a couple of the big office super stores and found that these pens are less than other brands of color gel ink pens.",1
"I am very in to fitness and workout on a regular basis and teach fitness classes, so quality products that I am going to get my money's worth is very important to me. 1st thing I noticed which is SUPER important to me because I am terrified of bands snapping is how its made. the bands are well  connected to the hook. There is a great stopper type thing around the end which appears as safety feature to prevent snapping. I really stretched these things out to make sure they will hold up and I'm pleased to say it's tightly secured and i don't fear it will snap or pull free from the hook part.. That is always my biggest concern with these things. 2nd thing it the resistance it provides and that fact that this is a set and not one single band. I that for around $34 is a great price. I have seen these types of bands sell for higher prices. i am happy i was able to purchase an entire set with many resistance options. the extra accessories are an added bonus as well because they provide you with different ways to use the product. its easy to use and made of durable materials. I feel this product is going to provide me with a lot of use.

i received this product at a discount and in return i provide my honest and opinion after thoroughly going over the product. i always strive to find quality products because that is very important to me. This is a product i will purchase again for my classes and i will recommend to people. i hope you found this review helpful.",1
"This french press is so cute! It's a little smaller than I expected but it's perfect for one person servings. I'm not sure if you could get more than two servings out of it, honestly. It's just perfect for those lonely mornings. It comes with directions just in case you're not familiar with french press coffee which is very helpful. It's easy to clean and fun to use. It's the perfect present to give as well! It's very good quality and I'm surprised the price is so low for the quality you get. It looks like I bought it at William Sonoma. I always get asked where I bought this and I send them to this amazon page.

"It is essential to have a pair of kitchen shears in your kitchen. It is convenient to have for cutting chicken, cutting open packages, and so much more. This pair of kitchen shears is very comfortable and sharp. I had no problem cutting through some chicken cartilage with it. The packaging also says this scissors would be good for cutting fish, cutting thin PVC plastic and paper, opening bottle caps on soft drinks, and cutting thing wire. I'm not sure I would want to use my kitchen shears for cutting wire though. The scissors also features a walnut opener. Overall great kitchen shears, but the packaging of the product isn't great. My kitchen shears fell right out of the packaging and there are several spelling errors on the package.

"I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

My children love being in the pool and we have been going through many cheap swimming googles.  When these were offered to me I was really looking forward to having my children try them out.  All my children have worn them and commented on how soft and comfortable they are.  My 10 year old has taken them over.
His words about these goggles:  I like them because they are soft and comfortable.  The strap doesn't pull my hair when I put them on and off.  I really like that when I am underwater the goggles don't fog up and I can see clearly.  Another thing I like is when looking at other colorful objects they don't change the coloring of them.
The straps are easy to adjust and stay put.  I did notice that the clips will pop off one side when we first tried to tighten them, but easy to remedy.

The case that the goggles come in a great.  It took us a few minutes to figure out how to open it, but love that the end twists to open the case.  Love that feature because we are always losing goggles from the pop open cases in our swim bags.  This way everything stays together.",1
"The Pro Fitness wooden balance board helps to tone your muscles, strengthen your core, and help to rehabilitate injuries. I injured my lower back and had to go through Physical Therapy. One of my strengthening exercises included using a balance board. Since getting this balance board, I have been able to continue these exercises at home to assist in my Rehabilitation of my injured back. This has really helped me strengthen and keep my lower back muscles toned as well as other muscles in my legs and feet. Overall, this is aided in the rehabilitation of my injury.
My physical therapist has noted how much better I am balancing and my ability to adjust to the balance board. My back has improved quicker because I can do these exercises at home as well, which increased my duration to balance, better coordination, and more flexibility on my part. This board is made of Premium wood and has a super non-slip board pad for your safety. It is 16 inches by 16 inches by 3.2 inches for dimensions and weighs about 3.5 pounds.

The Anvil lifting straps arrived quickly and as advertised.  If you are in the market for some new lifting straps I would recommend these.  I haven't been using straps lately but I didn't want my grip to limit my lifts so I chose to add these to my game.  The pad on the strap doesn't allow the strap to cut into your hand or wrist like others can.  It's a subtle addition but it made a difference.,0
The slide action is nice. It stops at whatever height it's left at. It's bright enough for most uses. No flames and long lasting batteries make it great.,0

I was scared it wasn't going to fit her or that it wasn't going to be anything like the picture but as soon as I opened it my worries were gone. When I tried it on my daughter it looked even better, its really cute bathing suit, the yellow is truly beautiful and the little hat makes the outfit unbelievably adorable. The day that we went to the beach and she was wearing it everyone had something to say about her look. I am extremely happy with my purchase and I will for sure consider this store above all others for my next bathing suit purchase.",1
"These are beautiful coasters.
I bought these to use in our family room but because of the size and look of them I will be using these in the living room.
As stated the look of these is stunning.  I got the round champagne gold ones which look very elegant.  These are a nice size for wine glasses or pilsners.  These are for use in a somewhat formal situation.
These are not large enough for beer or coffee mugs so we will continue to use the big old cork coasters in our family room.

My biggest objection to these is the smell.  Hopefully the chemical smell will dissipate.

"I've always just had knives in my kitchen drawer or in some sort of knife block, but this collection takes storing your knives to the next level! I love that they're magnetic, they work, and that they bring personality to my kitchen! They're easy to remove and put on the block and it doesn't take up too much space in my kitchen. The set I had before this one definitely came with a lot more knives, but I wasn't using them all, and if I was it was because it's what was there. These are the main 6 knives that anyone is going to need in their standard kitchen. I recently used them to cut chicken and potatoes up and had no issues at all and I cleaned it right away and put it right back on the block. The black part on the knives, though, are a bit oily, even after a few washes that feeling didn't go away. I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.",1

"I purchased this product to use on airplanes and in cars for travel. I had one of those standard neck pillows, but thought this would be a step up in quality. First thing I noticed, like others, is that there is a smell from the foam that is used in the product. It's not terrible, and I got used to it quickly, but it is there. The feel of the neck pillow is very nice. Soft fabric, soft foam, and feels well made. The carrying case that is included is awesome! The neck pillow rolls up to fit inside nicely. This helps save room and keep it contained well. There were also ear plugs included which was a nice added bonus.

While the quality of the product is high, I did not find it very comfortable to wear. You slip it over your head, use the draw string to tighten it, and your set to rest your head. However, I found that there wasn't quite enough support for my head...maybe I have a heavy head. I tried with it lose...this was worse. I tried flipping it upside down...definitely not right. I tried the left side and the right side...I just could not get comfortable. I wore it for about 2 hours and struggled to find the best position. I have a flight coming up and will try it on the plane to see how it works....maybe that will be a different feel.

Overall, you can feel that it is made with quality. The cooling vents on the side are definitely a nice feature as my other pillow will get warm on my neck. This did not happen while wearing this one.  As for comfortability, I think it depends on a few factors...size of your neck, shoulders, head, and probably even more factors that I can't think of... This product may work for you since we are all different shapes and sizes, however, my personal experience was subpar. *I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.*",1
"These are great! I have another pair of Bluetooth in ear headphones and these are much more comfortable for jogging. The other pair that I have has the controller part dangling a few inches below the right earphone and swings back and forth so much when I jog that the buds fall out of my ear (this is for the other pair). I am only able to use it for walking or sitting. However, this set of headphones has the weight right on the ears themselves directly attached to the buds that go into your ear. This way, the weight doesn't dangle. These earbuds are comfortable and they stay in your ears when jogging.

Like other in ear headphones, these come with different size inserts as well as other pieces and a drawstring bag. It also comes shipped in a nice presentable box so it would be perfect for gift giving! I'm not sure how long these will last for, but they last easily for several hours for an hour jog plus doing miscellaneous tasks around the house (maybe another 1-3 hours depending on the day). Sometimes I forget to charge it the night before and charge it for about 30 minutes before a jog and it lasts the whole time (for the jog and after-jog tasks).

"This product is for OHF 6 in 1 Bento Accessories Enjoy Dressing up Dolls Family Rice Mold Onigiri Shaper and Dry Roasted Seaweed Cutter Set. I've always wanted to make cute little bento lunches and was really excited to receive this. I was kind of worried about cutting the nori though, these didn't look sharp enough in the photos, and they aren't. They are just plastic, like cookie cutters, and I had trouble with my this egg omelet working the nori (I toasted it holding it over the stove top burner like the instructions said and my Grandmother did) but it didn't work. However the molds worked well, I just put fresh short grain rice from the rice cooker in, I didn't vinegar it for the onigri. I thought I'd use an X-Acto knife (I'm an artist and have lots of different handles and blades) but none of mine are fine enough I don't think, to cut out the faces. I ended up not using any cut outs as I couldn't get them to work. I'm new at making bento though, so I don't know all the tricks yet.

"I must admit...I was rather skeptical of the positive comments posted about this product.  My two main concerns - 1) the locking mechanism would be difficult to unlock, and 2) the can opening action would not be smooth.  I worries were put at ease after opening 15 cans back-to-back for a potluck I was cooking.

The cans opened easily, with minimal effort.  The locking mechanism alleviated the need to squeeze on the handles to ensure it open the cans smoothly.  There were a few cans where it didn't latch on properly, but with repositioning, it snapped in place and did what it's suppose to.

Personally, I did not find the magnetic part helpful, but it doesn't impact my love for this new can opener.

I did NOT receive any special considerations (free/discount) in providing this review.  Just your average Amazon user that totally value the honest/genuine feedback provided by others just like me.",1

"The Yeti is a quality cut but quite pricey. This cup is just as good but available at a fraction of the cost AND it comes with a metal straw and handle.

This 30 oz stainless steel tumbler is not only very attractive but is double insulated. The double wall vacuum insulation provides extreme temperature retention and insulates hands from the cold and heat. It retains ice for over 24 hours...I have even left the cup in my car during a hot work day only to come out after work to find ice still in my cup! And as far as hot drinks, the cup keeps hot drinks HOT for up to 6 hours. Sometimes it keeps hot drinks hot for so long that I actually have to wait for 30 minutes to 1 hour before I can even drink my coffee!

As for the value of the handle...the tumbler can be a little awkward to hold at times, especially for women who have smaller hands.  This handle makes it a little more comfortable to carry or hold for longer times, like when you are at an event where you are going to be holding your cup for an extended period of time.  The handle wedges firmly in place on the tumbler and it sits up high enough in the open bottom so that it will fit in almost every cup holder without any obstruction.  With this handle, your favorite stainless steel cup can actually fit in your hand!

"Poshei Polarized Sports Sunglasses I find a bit overpriced for the quality. These sunglasses come in a nice case with a cleaning cloth and even a card to test the polarization (see picture). In the picture the sunglasses appear to have rubber on the nose piece and temple tips to give grip, but it's actually plastic. The sunglasses are a very light-weight plastic that doesn't feel very sturdy. The nose bridge piece is narrow and makes the sunglasses sit on top of your nose. I can see below and above the lenses, because of the nose bridge. Personally, I've seen this same caliber at local supermarkets for $10 cheaper. The sunglasses are polarized, like described, but I don't find the quality and comfort great.

"I bought this cardigan because for two reasons: because I live in California where it's super hot in the summer (and therefore sweat shows through a lot of my clothing), and because I tend to get sunburns easily and wanted protection. I am extremely happy with this cardigan. I did receive this item at a discounted rate in return for an honest, unbiased review.

First thing I want to say is that when I received the cardigan in the mail, the company wrapped it up nicely and I appreciate that they took an effort to make the entire experience feel more upscale.

This cardigan is very light- it's perfect for me because I plan on wearing it while it's still warm outside, but beforewarned that this will probably not provide any excess warmth in the fall/winter. Also, the color of the cardigan is darker than the picture shown on amazon, which I prefer because I actually wanted it to be black, but just an FYI in case anyone ordering it was thinking it would be closer to dark grey.

The cardigan fits me quite well, so I'm happy about it. As a former gymnast, I have fairly broad shoulders so I sometimes have a hard time finding things with long sleeves that fit properly. I am also on the shorter side, at 5'3. The cardigan is not baggy on me, but there is plenty of room so I feel comfortable saying that someone smaller or bigger than me can comfortably wear this. The sleeve length is also good. The cardigan splits around the middle of my ribcage and it ends just above my knees. I did wish the split started a little lower, but I don't think it looks bad, it's just a personal preference of mine.

My favorite aspect of the cardigan is the material. The material is very soft and comfortable to wear. It's also very stretchy and flowy. I will also add that the material doesn't feel like it will snag as easily as other cardigans I've bought before.

Finally, I want to say that this is neutral enough that you can style it very easily. This is something I could easily see myself wearing to a rock concert or styling it up as chic, preppy or even bohemian. It is so cute and I am happy that I bought it.",1
"Great colors, great fit , great all around! I ordered mine in my fav color red. I have more petite hands and I love the fit of these. I do lift weights and use bands. I've developed small calluses over time. I'm enjoyed using these. My hands love me for it too. I love the nice snug feel no room for slipping. They really help my grip.

"Omg! Omg! Omg! The Chuester UpCup Double Walled Glass Travel Mug is amazing! My mother uses a travel mug every single day, aside from the weekend. She uses the mugs during her trip to and from work and at work. For years, she has used plastic travel mugs that we bought from Wal-Mart. However, they started breaking down after a bit. We ended up finding a glass travel mug and she fell in love with it. Therefore, we have been slowly replacing all the plastic travel mugs with glass ones. When I saw the Chuester UpCup Double Walled Glass Travel Mug, I knew that I had to get it for her. We love double walled glass, as it is much more sturdy and durable than other glasses; it also looks nice as well. The Chuester UpCup Double Walled Glass Travel Mug has been wonderful. My mother has been able to put ice coffee and hot coffee in the mug without any issues at all. The mint green is gorgeous. The cup is a great size; you can fit more than the average cup of coffee in it. The glass travel mug is very sturdy and solid. I have to say this is probably one of the best travel mugs that we have ever used. The top is easy to put on and you do not have to deal with spills. This travel mug is super easy to clean  it can be placed in the dishwasher, but I cannot use mine and I hand wash them. Ive had no issues at all with the glass. We will definitely purchase more. My mother is very happy and so am I. Highly recommend it!

"I have tendinitis in both wrists, with one progressing into carpal tunnel. This makes it difficult for me to experience any kind of resistance to my hands, including lifting (normal lifting and weights), doing push-ups or planking, and even sometimes just opening doors. I've had a lot of wrist guards/supports in the past and they're either uncomfortable, expensive, or cheaply made and do nothing for me. These gloves are super comfy, breathable, and seem well-made. The adjustable sizing is fantastic! For sizing purposes- I'm a 5'10 female and wear a size 7/8 ring.. I don't have tiny hands. I bought a large and with it being adjustable it's the perfect size option. I really love these- my workouts have improved immensely and I don't mind wearing them often when my tendinitis flares- and hope they last me for a while!

"Outputs audio, but no video signal. Apparently these units are known for being defective quite regularly. Check YouTube for videos of people fixing these units, which requires re-soldering. In my case, I could not find anything to re-solder, yet it does not work, so I'm returning it.",0
"I hang out in my hammock(s) a lot as I am pretty avid about them.  For this reason, reliable hammock straps are a must for people like me.  OxStraps had some good reviews, so I figured I'd try them out.

Pros:
--The straps do not stretch.  I looped them around a branch and hung from them for a few minutes, they had no stretch at all.
--The initial loop on either strap is used to hold the strap to the tree (by looping the strap around the tree and through its loop).  This strap has 4 lines of stitching - which is the first I've seen in any straps I've purchased.  This provides a lot more confidence in the straps ability to hold steadfast to the tree.
--Each strap is about 10 feet long, and depending on how thick the branch or trunk is, you can be a fairly decent distance away from the two trees.
--Each strap is technically one continuous strap that has been looped back and sewn to itself.  This means the end loop is technically the strongest as it has the holding power of every other sewn loops combined.
--I bought the red ones, which are really visible and remove most of the possibility of someone clothes lining themselves while walking by.
--Though they come with their own bag, since I have a couple ""self stuffing"" hammocks (comes with an attached pocket for storage), I am able to stuff these into the pocket with the hammock fairly easily.

Cons:
--Each of the loops after the initial loop is only held in place by a single line of stitching.  This is actually the first time I've seen this.  As I own a few other brands of straps, usually each loop has a minimum of 2 lines of stitching for more holding/backup.  With that said, the straps held me fine and I weight about 250 lbs.

Overall, these straps are great.  They come in bright colors that really make the straps visible.  The initial strap is quad-stitched to hold the hammock steadfast while hanging.  They also come with their own pouch.  I did receive these straps at a discount for an unbiased review.  However, as I have tested them and trust their ability to hold me, I've already replaced a set of ratchet straps holding up another hammock in my yard with these.",0
"I was first introduced to Opinel knives in 2007 in London by a German Boyscout and have carried a N6 ever since. They are some of the best knives with a great way of locking into place. My old n6 is still as sharp as the day I first got it and although the wood has picked up staining from denim and being in my pocket for 9 years it still is solid. When the opportunity to snag an n8 (which is a little bigger) came along I took it. This one comes with a leather sheath, which I will most likely toss in the junk drawer and never use as these knives very effectively lock close, but the leather is good quality and a nice touch. The n8 came yesterday and while stiff (needs to be worn in a bit) is absolutely fantastic. I hope someday to gather the whole set of opinels, though that is a daunting task at their prices, but for their budget priceing it is impossible to match their quality. Opinels are French made in the German style of blade. They can be easily sharpened and will retain their sharp for ages. Definitely worth a buy if you have never had the privilege of owning one of these exceptional blades. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1

"I have been using these sunglasses in my convertible driving around in bright sunshine and they are perfect for the job. The lenses are fairly dark and they're large, so they cover almost all of your field of view, perfect for a convertible or just being outside. Despite the large lenses they're fairly light, so they're comfortable to wear for an extended period. I also like the case that will keep them protected when you store them away and the included cleaning cloth so that I don't scratch them up using my shirt. I like them so much I'm thinking of buying a second pair. I received these glasses at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

And it is solar powered! Yes, I love this package setup!
The Good:
1) Absolutely brilliant light emits from either fromt or side.
2) Flashing mode is capable of a self defense mode in my opinion as it can temporarily cause disorientation and serves as an alert/urgent signal as well.
3) Red flashing mode is awesome and clearly flashes a brilliant emergency sequence in two speeds.
4) Seat belt cutting tool is safe to handle with no chance of cutting yourself.
5) Window smashing point is always a good thing to have and is installed into a sturdy section of the flashlight tool. I don't believe you could damage the flashlight by hitting out a widnow (I didn't try it).
6) Magent is super strong.
7) Solar panel is sufficient to charge the internal battery enough for emergency use.
8) Rechargeable battery via usb allows me to charge my phone as well, at least part way.
9) Removable cap with compass is accurate enough to guide you.
The Bad:
1) If there is one thing bad it might be the clear plastic that covers the side LED's. It seems like it might be the weakest link. I think this flashlight would also be waterproof if it weren't for the way that plastic was just popped onto the handle. If this could be sealed and thicker it would be better, but seriously I think it's okay for average use.

"I must admit I was expecting a bigger flashlight, so it's smaller than I expected. But it does shine pretty bright. I tested it out while it was still plugged in charging. I do like the fact that you can use it charged or on batteries.

It comes in a handy plastic carrying case. They also include a cigarette lighter adaptor so you can charge your flashlight in the car. I think that's pretty handy especially if you're camping, hiking or other place you might not have access to electricity and your batteries run out. I plan on keeping the whole set in my car. My dad told us to always carry a flashlight in your car and this is perfect!

"This woman's scrub set felt soft and wearable right out of the package.  I'm relieved to be able to report that the material isn't thin or see through.

The XXL top fit me very well, and the pants have an elastic waist so I had no problems with fitting around the hips, but I'm short so the legs were a bit too long for me (as usual), but that's just me - I'm used to having to hem scrubs that don't have elastic ankle cuffs.

This scrub set seems true to size and is comfortable. The fabric quality appears to be good and the workmanship of the sewing looks good. They held up to washing well and held their size. Good quality! Item supplied in exchange for evaluation and review

The set is machine washable, so I tossed them in the laundry with a small load of whites and ran a quick wash cycle on warm. Once finished I ran them in the dryer on medium until dry, then tried them on once again to test for shrinkage. They still fit the same as before I washed them.

Overall, they were comfortable around the waist, roomy in the legs, and other than length they were very comfortable. I received this product discount or free for an honest review.",1
"The Fitbit Alta Screen Protector by Skinomi is exactly what I needed for my Fitbit Alta. The screen protector covers the screen almost entirely! I love the matte finish because you cant really tell that there is something covering the screen.  The anti-glare also helps to reduce glare and gives you better visibility especially when you are walking outside during the day and the sun is bright. The screen protector blends right in with the quality design of the Fitbit Alta. The protector includes step-by-step directions that tell you how to apply the screen protector on the Fitbit Alta. I was able to apply the screen protector the first time!  It was super easy and there were no bubbles under the screen protector. I wear my Fitbit Alta everyday all day long and I don't have any scratches or nicks in the screen protector. Although the pack includes six screen protectors, I have only used one, which speaks to the quality of this product!

"What an amazing product! This mattress encasement in unlike all of the others that I have purchased in the past!  I am the mother of a disabled daughter who sometimes has issues with spilling things on her mattress and occasional bed wetting.  This mattress encasement is a full cover and is nothing short of amazing!  The cover encases the entire mattress, thus protecting the sides of the mattress as well as the top. The material used on this encasement  is made of a wonderfully soft and stretchy material. The waterproof zipper is very sturdy and opens and closes with ease. There is a flap attached for bed bugs, although I can't say how that aspect works as we do not have an issue with those (thankfully!).  This mattress encasement is machine washable AND dryable, unlike most mattress covers.  However, it does stay that hand washing is best. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with kids or who is a caretaker for a person with special needs.  I will be coming back to purchase these for all of the rooms in my home.

"Bottom Line: Well made and so comfortable!

I love these cycling shorts  they are the perfect mixture of comfortable and function! At first I was a little hesitant to order a pair of cycling shorts online since I would not be able to touch or examine the quality first, but I am so happy that I did because these are great!

First of all, the shorts are very comfortable and work great. The gel seat is thick and prevents the bike from causing any pain while riding. I wear these for hour long spinning classes and have no issue with the shorts. They are super comfortable and make spinning class pain free and enjoyable  this is especially important when riding bikes (stationary or not) that do not have a gel seat in themselves. Additionally, the shorts are very breathable, which makes them cool to wear and wicks sweat away easily. They are shorter than most of the other bike shorts I have seen, which is awesome because they fit comfortably under my other shorts.

Equally as important, these bike shorts are well constructed. The seams are durable and the gel seat is securely affixed to the shorts. I have put them through the washing machine and they remain in perfect condition.

I purchased the shorts in the black shorts and blue seat combination. The seat is a true blue and the shorts are a true black. The shorts look just as they do in the picture, so there were not surprises there (which is always a great thing when ordering something online and you can not see it in person before purchasing it).

The cycling shorts arrived quickly and on time. Additionally, the shorts arrived in perfect condition and well protected in packaging. I am very happy with this purchase and would certainly buy another product from this company. I have already recommended it to a few friends and think it is a great product at a great price point.

"So far this has been one of the more successful products I have tried in my battle to rid my apartment of cat pee! I got this and many other kinds of odor and enzymatic cleaners to battle having 2 puppies and an angry older cat who has started to urinate on the carpet to show his displeasure at not being an only child anymore. So far this is the only one of the cleaners that has been able to touch the carpeted spot that my cat keeps using. It hasn't taken it completely away yet, but it has cut the smell and I'm hoping that if i just pour this on and let it saturate the area that I will finally rid me of the smell without having to redo all the carpeting. I used this on a couple of fresher accidents and it worked wonderfully and it has a light, but not overpowering or masking scent like some of the other things I have used. Which is good because that can cause animals to try and cover up the smell of the cleaner with their own.... That's never a fun problem to have. All in all I am very happy with the product and hopefully this will be the one that will help!  I received a discount for this product and agreed to provide my unbiased opinion in this review.

"Im asian 5 feet tall, 99lbs, 27 waistline and my bust size is 32B. I used to wear small size coz I'm petite woman. This Missaloe Women Seamless Basic Shapewear Mid-Thigh Bodysuit Comfort Bodyshaper is pretty they are made of 82% Polyamid & 18% Elastan. I order black color coz for me it gives more slim to the body. When I wear this Bodysuit it gives my body more shape and curve and I feel so sexy looking in the mirror. I like the fabric that theres an elasticity that will fit to the body. You can feel the comfortable and relaxing breathable as you wear it. The fabric is not itchy and you can feel the smoothness and softness of the cloth as you wear it. I like the strap that it can be adjusted. The chest part fit nicely and perfect size for me. When I wash this Bodysuit no shrinkage of the fabric still the same as it was. The stitches nice and clean the threads hold tight. There is an opening on the crotch in this Bodysuit for me its unique style. This Bodysuit you can put fahion on it wear outside just pair this with jeans, short, skirt or even leggings and your ready to go for shopping, biking,walking or go out with friends. So much happy having this kind of Bodysuit. I will recommend  just try this one.

"So I chose to review the pink case with rhinestones, and I absolutely love the color. It's a two piece case one part hard plastic which is pink, and the other part gray which is silicone. Ports are completely accessible, as well as my camera. The silicone part of the case has a decent lip at the front to protect the face of the phone. Dropped my phone twice and it landed on its face with no damage. So as for now I can't complain, it has served its purpose.
Buttons are easily operable, doesn't take much effort to adjust volume or lock my screen. Although I have failed a few times at attempting to take screen shots, and the screen locking instead, lol, but I can't 100% guarantee that it was the case that caused it to happen. Overall, it is definitely a great case, for a great price! If your in the market for a new case to protect your device, and don't want to spend a lot for those fancy otterbox cases. This is definitely the case to buy.

"These are absolutely gorgeous rings. Made from the finest and highest quality of tungsten carbide.  True craftsmanship in these beautiful rings. Now to explain the low rating.  I ordered a size 13. I went by the size chart which in size 13 approximately 69.7 millimeters in circumference. Well, upon receiving the tungsten carbide rings, I immediately noticed the size. It was quite large. I measured the circumference in these rings that were sent to me and it measured at a whopping 90 millimeters. I contacted the seller several times and absolutely no response at all.

"I really enjoy sketching and painting, and in addition to matting and framing my art, or putting them into protective sleeves, sometimes I need to laminate my work, so over the years I've owned a number of laminators and have tried a wide range of thermal laminating pouches in various shapes, sizes, and thicknesses.

This set includes a 200 pack of 3 mil thick 9 x 11.5 inch thermal laminating pouches that can accommodate up to 8.5 x 11 inch sheets of paper. In my tests, they fit 8.5 x 11 inch pieces of photo paper just fine.

The sleeves are pre-sealed on one side (one of the short sides), which makes inserting and aligning paper in it quite easy. While the sleeves themselves have a slight bit of a frosted color to them, once you run them through your laminator, the frosted color goes away and the final result is rather clear. They are 3 mil thick and have a glossy finish and beveled edges.

The packs of laminating pouches came in two separate packs of 100 pouches each which were packaged together inside the outer box, totaling 200 total laminating pouches. I actually found this quite convenient to have two separate packs rather than one massive pack.

I don't have any complaints about this pack of 200, 3 mil, 9 x 11.5 inch thermal laminating pouches, and I would definitely recommend them to anyone interested in laminating their work.

I am a longtime Amazon Prime customer who enjoys writing reviews in my free time. I was appreciative to be given an opportunity to test and review these thermal laminating pouches complimentary for my honest and unbiased review. If you have any questions or comments, please comment or message and I'll be glad to help!",1
"I really do love these headbands for girls and here are all my reasons why : ).
They are subtle, normal looking, and adorable. The colors are lovely and not super bright. The fabric is gentle on the baby. They don't fit too tightly or too loosely. I don't tend to like headbands that have a really big flower or glitter or anything, but rather I like ones that are simple and still feminine, so these were just what I was looking for. The knotted, slightly floppy, bow look is lovely to me. I also like the braided ones.  These could go with so many outfits. These are stretchy so you really can use it for multiple ages, which is great. I've been putting these on my 6 month old daughter since they arrived and she seems happy and comfortable with them on. I would definitely recommend these.

I don't see any negatives at this point.

I moved from the OnePlus 2 Official flip case to this case as the flip case was beginning to wear out.

In comparison to that case, there are obviously some ups and downs.

Pros:
 - Feels sturdy.
 - I was originally concerned about how the polycarbonate layer attached to the TPU portion of the case as the pictures aren't clear on how this works. As it turns out, the end of each ""leg"" of the polycarbonate bends in and fits snuggly into holes in the TPU. This means that there's no concern of the outer layer coming off accidentally. (See attached images)
 - Protects the phone entirely, including the screen. The TPU goes beyond the screen a little so if the phone is dropped face down on flat ground, the case will protect the phone's screen from damage.
 - All buttons are accessible on the phone, along with the do not disturb toggle switch.
 - Fingerprint reader is not covered.
 - Polycarbonate cover (on Metallic Slate) does not show fingerprints easily.

Cons:
 - The buttons are more difficult to push than without a case on, but are still usable. This has been the case with every case I've had that covers the physical phone buttons.
 - This can be seen as a negative for some people - Though I put it in the pros column.. The case does cover above the side of the phone, which can cause some difficulty in accessing the edge of the screen for some apps, but the bezel on the phone makes this much less of an issue than it is on other devices.

Overall, this is the best case that I've owned for the OnePlus 2.

"I love these wineglasses I do not have to worry about them getting broken. They are nicely made not a single problem with them. They shine and are smooth, perfect to use for a party. Since they are stainless steel there should be no ware and tear. Great steel wine glasses and would make a great gift for the wine fanatics out there. I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.",1
"These adorable glasses are perfect for even your youngest tyke.  I love the wide and bright variety of colors to choose from too.  I purchased these glasses for my 18 month old daughter but even my 6 year old is able to wear these comfortably and still keep the unwanted rays out of her eyes.  These glasses are durable and a great price point for fun UV ray protective eyewear for children.  I would highly recommend this product to others.

This is a great lightweight and affordable cage jacket. No need to spend a lot of money on other cage jackets when this one serves the same purpose.,0
"This dress is made from soft material for the lining and bodice and the lace covers the skirt part. I think it is a pretty good quality dress for the cost, but it was a little big on me. I am 5'7"" and 105 pounds so pretty slender and it fit but it wasn't the most flattering. I think an XS would have been better for me. I am happy with the construction of the dress and it's not heavy, but it's not light either. It's sturdy. I'd recommend it. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I am occasionally lucky enough to receive a product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review of that product. I am never paid to post a review on Amazon. I use Amazon review ratings to make my own purchases too so rest assured all my opinions are 100% my own and truthful.

My star rating system is as follows:
Five Stars: I loved this product and it worked out just the way I hoped it would. The product is attractive, well-packaged, and completes all of its described functions. This is a good quality product that is worth the cost.
Four Stars: I liked this product. It does what it is supposed to. The product is either slightly less quality than I would have hoped but works well for me, or it is good quality but just doesn't serve my functions ideally. This is still a good product, but I recommend you make sure it is exactly what you want before purchasing (size-wise, color, material, etc.)
Three Stars: This product is OK. It may be deficient in quality, size, or it may be inappropriately suited to my needs but still fully functional. A three star rating means it didn't live up to my expectations but I am still able to use it.
Two Stars: This is a fine product but it did not suit my needs. I give a product a two star rating when I can see its usefulness, but I simply cannot incorporate it into my life. This could be a drastically different size, color, or material, or just a poor quality item. Two star rating could also mean I'm able to use it, but I don't like it due to quality, aesthetics, or just my own tastes.
One Star: I really don't like this product and don't recommend it to anyone. This product is poor quality or completely different than what was described on the website.

I ordered these based on good reviews but after receiving and trying them out so far I am very displeased with this product. In the initial tryout Inhad to keep my head still and not the. it the least bit and it took about 10 minutes for them to pick up the DVD player. We tried to use them 2 days later and couple never get them to pick up/connect to listen to the movie. My plans are one more attempt and if not successful return for refund.,0

"I received this vintage floral dress for free in exchange for my honest review.

This dress is really gorgeous. The flower pattern is bright and colorful and I love the shade of blue. I'm always looking for bright colorful pieces to add to my wardrobe and I think this will transition nicely through the seasons. The fabric is pretty stretchy which turned out to be a good thing since I had ordered an XXL (I normally wear a 14/16) and when I pulled it out of the package it looked like it might be a bit small. However, it ended up fitting very well. The fabric is also pretty thick and not see through which is always a plus for dresses.

This dress will definitely need ironing after washing and was a little wrinkly after being packaged - though not too bad. This usually is a deal breaker for me as I hate to iron with the fire of a thousand suns, but this dress is really beautiful! It'll be worth the ironing to have it ready to go in the closet.

The only thing about this dress that I wasn't crazy about was that there is a tie for the back. However, I'll probably just cut the tie off and wear a belt to give it some definition.

All in all I'm very happy with this dress and would definitely recommend that you get one. I'll be buying some other colors and styles soon too!",1

"This item is great. I solely purchased MYNT due to having a Bluetooth camera clicker. Everything else was a plus one. I love how you are able to configure the settings on a app to your liking. I usually forget my phone and the smart tracker emits a small ring to alert you, that you have gone a distance forgetting it. I purchased 2 for keys car keys. My main one and my spare. The look to it is very modern and simple which is why it caught my eye the most. The packaging comes with all the instructions you need as far as set up. Once in the app you can actually customize photo icons for each MYNT added. At the home page, when you click on the center icon (Your phone) and gray ring flows outward and starts to locate your closet trackers. This has became a great addition to my lifestyle considering I'm a pretty forgetful person.

I've owned another brand portable solar panels so I needed another one to hang in my window to charge things without electricity while I'm at work. I use this one for on the go and it has never let me down yet. It has durable zippers opposed to Velcro enclosures like the other one. It's a plus when they give you carabiners to hang wherever you can allow to do so and it fits very well in a backpack and I hardly notice it's there sometimes. I waited to give a review so I could properly rate this and overall I love this product. People at work use it too and they asked me how they cost because they wanted one and I say they are very reasonable price wise for what you get so they may buy one in the future. I'll be buying more products from ECEEN in the future for sure. Thanks again for making a durable product.,0
"Just received the Bluetooth speaker today and first impressions are it's a great little setup. On an apple device like iphone and iPad, it will report back the battery life which is kinda handy. All in all, I'm very pleased.",0
"This harness is great! I have two Chinese Pugs and they are sometimes hard to size correctly, because they are very broad chested and skinny at the waist.

Both Pugs weigh about 22 pounds, I purchased the medium and with a little strap adjustment they fit perfectly, worth mentioning is the fact that it fits nice in snug (with plenty of strap room if my puggies get fatter), so when crazy Pug tries to run off I do not have to worry about her escaping out of the harness.

The closures at first I thought were huge, but let me tell you they are way easier to snap shut on a spastic dog, than the closures on my old harness, that were tiny.  Also, there are four closures, so when I put on the harness, I have the top two snapped and I easily slip it over her head and snap the bottom two.  To take it off, I just unsnap one side on the top and bottom and it just falls away, I don't have to pull it back over her fat head.

Added plus, the material is durable and I see this harness lasting quite a long time.

Overall, great quality and better design than any other harness I have owned.

"I decided to get this because I have to drive between several buildings for my job and don't want to have to bring my purse or my wallet with me every time just to have my license on me... For that reason, this little card holder works quite well for me. I kept the little piece or plastic that was over the sticky part and I put it back on if I'm not using it. It really only holds 2 cards, which is a really tight squeeze, so I don't advise trying to put too many more than that in it.

"I have gotten 2 of this luggage straps, one in yellow and other one in pink. They both claim to be ""superior strength extra"".

I got them because I was traveling and I had 3 baggages. My plan was put them together using the straps and move them to the exit. See the pictures.

I did it and it worked pretty well.

However something I did not like about this product was the fact that I paid $6.99 dollars for the larger one and $5.97 for the smaller one, but once they arrived the length was exactly the same. I did not contact the seller since I had to used them as soon as they arrived.

I love anything with skulls on them, and the design is unique with the stripes on one legs. The material is a spandex and stretchy and thin, so it will be nice working out in them. I will definitely say, pay close attention to the size for these! It is a one size fits all and make sure you are within the measurements given! They will not stretch much bigger.",1

I came across this one and I have to that I am really impressed. It's a solid build and slim design. I've seen others but the quality of their products does not comes close to this one.

The bottom includes plastic grips which help prevent the pad from sliding around on your table. I have a wooden table and this makes it very easy to use. Overall I am very satisfied.

"OMG, what can I say about this case except wonderful.

I honestly was not expecting such a great product. I was looking forward to a regular case. But this has really out done the rest. This case was very durable and not heavy. Talk about safe and security for your phone, this is it. I received this case at no cost to me for my true, honest and unbiased opinion. The case is very durable. To me it is a rugged commercial grade type case that could withhold a lot of falls and drops. The thickness keeps your phone in place as my phone fit snug and in place.

This thing sounds like airplane is taking off. You have to force the K cup in and force it closed. You definitely have to pour the water slowly. Some k cups (like Maxwell House that has a rippled cup edge trying to be fancy) do not work in this design. It just collapses under the heat and the maker pours out hot water. Wasted cup. Just buy the original k cup machine - way easier. No wasted K cups. Better cup of coffee.,0

I purchased this for my dog with digestive issues and issues eating.  After taking it over the last few days she appears to be eating and feeling somewhat better.  Her stools are better, her ears are perky and she even plays a little.  A bonus is she doesn't mind the taste and I don't have to hide it in her food, just mix it up real good, nothing extra added!

"The big picture - I really love them! I didn't give them 5 stars because there are some weird quirks though that I will list below.  I accepted these (and only accept items I know I will use) because we live on a 10 acre lot and mow probably 5 to 6 acres of it. So I am on the mower a lot during the week. I used to use earbuds with cords but when you are riding on our bumpy yard the cord sticks to your skin and pulls and pulls until eventually it gets super tight and the ear buds pop out. So these are amazing and you can't even tell I""m wearing them.
- So the directions are a little weird. You can tell English is not the first language. But it didn't take long to figure out how to pair it to my phone.
- The Bluetooth isn't 100%. I've used a lot of bluetooth devices in my day. I would say the 3 hours straight I wore them, it fuzzed in and out probably 6 or 7 times randomly. Never completely disconnected but just kind of fuzzed. You could tell it was trying to find the connection (definitely not my phone).
- If the volume is up on your phone because you're listening to music and someone calls. A lady with a horrible accent will say the numbers of the phone number calling you. Then if you answer, which I had no idea how to do but I remembered there was a phone looking button on the side, the person you're talking to will be VERY LOUD.

All in all they are really handy to have. They stayed in my ears well and I usually have problems with that with regular ear buds. For the price, they're totally worth it! I'd probably buy another set of them if I ever lost these.  I was offered these for free so I could test them and give my honest feedback. I only accept products I know I will use and can properly test. Please ignore how gross I am in the photo I attached! I had been mowing the lawn for over an hour at that point and thought I should take a picture of them in action! Haha!",1

"This wired earphone from Foxin provides very clear sound and the bass is very good. I compared this with a few of the other brand earphones I own and it was giving out the same sound quality as the other costlier brands of price range 30 and above.

The inner ear loop provided makes it fit comfortably in the ear. This prevents it from falling off during workouts. The package came with 3 pairs of inner loop and silicon earbuds (Large ,Medium and Small). So this earphone can be used by everyone and don't have to worry about the size.

The wire is quite long and so phone can be kept in the pant pocket or in backpacks and still can reach till the ear. A clamp also is provided in the box which can hook the earphone wire to the shirt and prevent it from bouncing around while jogging/running.

The connector is gold plated and a pause/play control button is also present. There is no volume control though.

I figured it would be too loose fitting on me to wear as a dress. I was so, so happy when I got it in the mail and tried it on for the first time. This is now one of my new favorite summer dresses! I love the way it fits, and I love the way it feels! This dress is truly one of the most comfortable dresses I have ever owned. The material is so silky soft against my skin. It is a very light and airy fabric which living in Florida is so nice in the hot summer months. It is made out of 95% rayon and 5% spandex. It is a looser fitting dress, but in a cute way. I love the colors in it as well. Pink is my favorite color, and I love the way it has the white at the top that fades into light pink, that fades into dark pink. It is a little see through at the top so I definitely have to wear a white bra with it. I am 5'5"", 34C bust, and about 105-107 pounds. I would say this definitely fits true to size in US sizes. I usually wear an XSmall/Small and ordered a Small, and it is perfect. It comes down to a couple inches above my knee which I think is the perfect length for a summer dress. It has a scoop neck in the front, and in the back. The straps are wide enough to be able to wear a regular bra without it showing. The stitching is very nicely done with a double row of stitching at the bottom, with zig zag stitching on the inside. The stitching at the top is a single row of stitching, but it is straight with no loose threads or snags. I have washed this on gentle cycle with cold water, and dried in the dryer on low. It does say to air dry, but I didn't have an issue with it shrinking at all. This dress is made in the USA which to me is an added bonus. I love this dress, and would definitely recommend it! *I received this dress at a discounted price for testing purposes, and for an honest review.

"This is the third yoga mat I have bought and by far my favorite.

Out of the three yoga mats this one has the most padding which does make it bigger when rolled up, but not overly so. The extra padding makes this one more comfortable, which especially comes in if you are on a harder floor like wood/laminate/tile. This mat is made more eco friendly, which is super important since our children inherit our world. This Yoga mat is also longer than many, which is a plus for most people but could be trimmed if you wanted.

"Not sure if the batteries were bad when I got it but they stopped working right away.  However, another problem was the little rings that attach it to the item.

"This brings me back to days of beepers and flip phones. It's been ages since I saw a clip on phone case that slides in and out like this. While it makes me feel a little old, I'm really happy to see it, because they were more functional than I think most people give them credit for.

Out of the box, the pieces easily came apart and felt sturdy but light. When put together, I fully expect that mom's phone wrapped in this case would be super safe. The phone snapped into the case quite easily; it was a bit hard to remove, but I think that's normal with new cases, over time it will give a little more. The case adds a bit of weight, particularly at the back of the phone. I never will understand the whole slim electronics thing. I'm not comfortable with anything without some weight to it. Mom doesn't mind it. I liked holding it. I wish the sides of the case came up a little higher on the device, but it's high enough to snap around the edges, so I think it will protect it just fine. With this case you'll mostly have it in its holster anyway.

The kick stand is interesting, and takes a bit of getting used to, but is pretty awesome, mom and I thought. You pull it out at the back where there are two little indents, and slide it down until it rests below a small lip that holds it in place. You can use it standing up, or on the side. It rotates easily, with some small clicking sounds. It is advertised as rotating 180 degrees, but we were able to turn the thing in a full circle, which is a bonus as far as we were concerned. To put the kick stand away, you just lift up where the lift is, and slide it back up. Easy.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I believe that this is a great case for travel. It feels sturdy, it performs all the functions that it advertises, and Mom is excited to use it out and about, which is a huge plus!",1
Changed the RV lights to theses bright soft led lights. Chose the flat design projecting more direct lighting to coach. A lot less heat and voltage draw which every RV'er appreciates. Thought wife would not approve but she really liked the brightness and even lighting throughout the motorhome. No yellow lighting here.,0
"First, I should mention that I am a girl. I liked these pants and didn't see why they couldn't be for girls, too, especially the purple color. I really love the style and cut of these. For reference, I usually wear a size 8 in women's, I'm 5'5, and I weigh 160 pounds. I read that these run small, so I got the size 36X30. The waist is loose on me, but the butt fits tight. When I sit down, these completely show my butt and there's a bulge of fabric in the front for obvious reasons, lol. These were obviously designed for flat-butt dudes. I'll just have to wear a belt with these. The length is definitely long enough for me with probably 6 inches to spare, so these will be fine for tall people. As other reviewers have said, the material is really weird on these pants. It's relatively thick material, but it's like what a picnic table cloth is made out of, kind of plastic-y. It isn't the most comfortable material, but it isn't uncomfortable either. I find it a little scratchy, although the tag does say that these are 100 percent cotton. They feel almost like they would be water-resistant, but I don't think they are. Also as other reviewers have said, the button is huge. Now that I've unbuttoned and re-buttoned it a few times, it goes through the button hole easily, but it was difficult at first. These obviously aren't the highest quality pants. There are some loose threads and they don't feel like the most durable attire, but I do like them. Would I buy them again? Probably not, because the fit is weird (probably because I'm a girl), the material is weird, and the quality isn't the best, but I am happy enough with them. I knew to expect the weird material based on other reviews, so that was the risk I took. The pockets are deep and they look just like the picture. Overall, I wouldn't buy them again, but I like them despite all their flaws.

"This is compact and fits nicely on the waist area. I use it when I walk daily to keep my phone, a few bills, some chapstick and eye drops as well as other essentials I may need. It keeps my hands free for my water bottle and other needs. I like this color as it blends in with most all outfits. It is of a sturdy material and the zippers work really well. It is water resistant, and when I sweat while walking my contents do not get damp.  The belt is adjustable. There are three different pockets, one on the back side, a top pocket and a front pocket and all close with zippers . It can be cleaned with a warm cloth and dish soap. It can be high on the waist or on the hips and is really unisex in color and in design.  It does not slip down, seems durable and should last me a long time.

I got this so that I could mount my iPad to a tripod as part of a DIY photobooth. It worked wonderfully! I was hoping that it could also pivot or rotate. Luckily my tripod has that ability.,0
Had Cuisinart 35 years have used daily.  Just replaced with this 14 cup and started prepping for dinner party and the entire top broke in two pieces.  Had already thrown away the box to tossed in trash.  Will tell anyone buy a Kitchenaid before touching a Cuisinart.  not the same quality product as I had before and just threw my money away on Amazone.  Will purchase locally realizing importance of just that.,0

"This is a review of a free product. I received this chair free for the purpose of review.

What is this and why might I want it?: This is a version of the foldable camp chairs that have become quite popular with backpackers. This version weighs in at right around 2 pounds which is about a half pound heavier than the Alite versions that seem to be among the most popular. This chair though has 4 legs versus the 2 leg Alites that require one to balance while sitting. It is basically two simple parts: the mesh seat and the aluminum legs which pull out and attach in the same manner as tent poles.

Does it work?: Yes, and very well. I took it on a 3 day trip into California's Trinity Alps Wilderness last weekend and tested it thoroughly and have the following observations to share:

Does it work for backpacking?: Yes. At two pounds (including carry bag) you are committing a half pound more than you would be with some other models, but I believe it's an average weight for this style of chair and for me the comfort was well worth both pounds of weight. It folds into a narrow carry case that makes it easy to pack and so I didn't miss the room it took up at all. Assembly and disassembly are so easy and quick that I had zero regrets about bringing it along (12 miles of hilly hiking into and out of base camp).

Assembly: Really couldn't be easier. The legs and frame are on bungees just like a tent pole. Snap them into the hard plastic joints and you're ready to add the mesh seat. The mesh has 4 pockets into which the seat poles slide. That's it, you're assembled and ready to sit.

Appearance: Very similar in appearance to several other models out there. I've been referencing the Alite because it was the first I ever saw. The King Do Way actually has more seating surface than the Alite, including a higher back. It also has a higher weight allowance at 220 pounds versus 200 for the Alite. Poles are blue on my sample and the mesh seat is black. Overall appearance meets my expectations though I could do without the large King Do Way logo.

Build: This is the most important aspect and I was able to give the chair significant use over three days. I realize that 3 days isn't necessarily a long time, but backpackers know that 3 days of use in the back country will expose a cheaply made product pretty quickly. The aluminum frame is sturdy and perhaps even more importantly, the plastic joints are thick and feel heavy duty. The mesh upper had no flaws. The pockets on the mesh seat where the poles insert are reinforced and I have no concerns about failure at those sites. I should note here that upon first use, the mesh seat is very tight and it takes a few minutes for one's weight to stretch it into a proper seat. At 210 pounds, this process didn't take long at all. I should note here that the very first time you put the seat on the poles you have to give it a serious stretch. After you've sat in it for a few minutes it will be stretched and you won't have that difficulty again.

Feet: Here is the biggest difference that I could see between the King Do Way and the Alite. The Moon Lence has narrow feet which make sinking into soft ground easier than a wide foot would. Our base camp had several soft spots and the King Do Way does sink in soft ground. However, the Alite, even with its notably wider feet had the exact same issue when I observed it on a previous trip (one month ago) on soft ground. It was simple just to pop up and move to a different spot. By my observation, I could not say that the wider feet on the Alite made any significant difference in reducing sinking and in fact, I thought the King Do Way was a better seat when it had sunk as it didn't tip as much.

Any negatives?:
-Narrower feet than more expensive chairs
-Slightly heavier than more expensive chairs.

Anything else of note?:
-Eligible for free shipping to members of Amazon Prime.

Bottom line: The King Do Way folding chair performed very well during my 3 day trip in the back country. Though slightly heavier than the more expensive than high end models like the Alite, it is easier to balance, and provides more seating space. There are certainly some minor advantages to the more expensive chairs, but when you consider that the King Do Way costs less than half as much in many cases, it's easy to say that it merits very serious consideration from shoppers looking to add a light weight foldable chair to their backpacking arsenal. Based on my own experience it is likely to please many who were planning to spend much more.",1
Love it.  This was a gift for my son in law.  He absolutely loves these headphones.  He says they sit nicely on his ears and great sound.,0
"This is a nice little item to have on your desk. Laying your phone down works just as well, but this holds the phone at a perfect viewing angle. Its solid cast aluminum which is nice if your device gets hot it can work as a poor mans heatsink. There are slots available for running cables through the stand while your device is present. There are also sticky rubber feet on the inside of the stand to securely hold your phone in place (This is nice when you need to slide the phone to a different angle but don't want it to slide out of the stand). Another fun nice to have is the fact you can use the stand to hold your phone for video conferencing while working away or doing something else. The stand itself is also very light, throw it in your bag and you won't even notice the weight.

I bought this stand to free up some desk space and get my phones off the desk from laying down. So far it works perfectly and holds the phone at a perfect viewing angle. The option to feed cables through the stand helps to hold and change devices while they are present within the stand. The color is a little much for me, but its a nice change with a blank desk and black monitors (The gold makes it a nice accent piece).

Pros:
Very light weight
Cast aluminum
No slide rubber feet and phone holders
Groves for feeding cables

Cons:
Nothing so far.

Nice glow. Lasts a long time. Would order again.,0
"I recently purchased the LE 30W Motion Sensor Light, LED Flood Lights. and it stated it was the equivalent of a 75 watt high pressure sodium light. Well someone is WAY off there, it's more like a 200+ watt HPS or a 400 watt halogen flood light. The unit is heavy built and is a fairly nice size. with a glass lens that will be nice if it needs cleaned it won't be getting scratched and end up blocking some light.
The cord is long enough to be hardwired to an electrical box.
The sensitivity of the detector has adjustments that will take a little time and adjusting to get them to work well but it does work nice once set. And WOW does this light up a pretty big area and with a really white light, not a yellowish dull color.
The mounting bracket does well to hold the light solid, but there is no way to adjust the direction left and right. but with a little imagination and a wood, plastic, spacer and some longer mounting screws you can at least get it pointing close to where you need it.
Overall I'm pretty happy with it so far.
Oh and the wire colors are different than US standards, so double check when hooking up.

"This case first off if anyone has read my reviews on cases I love variety in cases!! I hate having the same color or same type of case day in and day out its boring to me!! I even bought two glitter cases for my last phone just so I could play with the phone more often. I love color somedays with cases depends on my mood, but mostly I love variety!!  The first thing that caught my attention with this case was the pink on it. I love pink, and this pink against the black really makes it pop. I have even gotten a couple compliments about how cute this case it. And lets face it for the heavy duty cases this is no easy task!! This case is a bit bulky compared to my other cases. I usually prefer the slim line look. So I use this one when I am going to be outside a lot and I don't have to keep it in my purse or in my pocket. So far this has held up to me, which is saying something and even being outside for a good deal of time this week it cleaned up pretty nice and looks almost new again. But to be totally honest, I just love the fact that its pink!! I think all pink would have been too much so this to me anyway is the best of both worlds. This case is a great addition to my collection and believe me I have a collection of these things. I would recommend this to a friend or a family member looking for a case that feels a little more durable!! I did receive this at a discounted rate for my unbiased and honest opinion!!",1

"This screen protector is a premium product. Now, when you buy screen protectors, you want to buy them really carefully because there are several chap Chinese products that get scratches or cuts very easily. You do not need to worry about those things with this protector.

It nicely wraps the device without leaving any air bubbles in the middle and the corner of the device. The protector feels like glass which is a really nice feeling when you touch the screen. It is hard to explain but this protector adds more fanciness to your phone. It adds smoothness when touching your phone, and it does not disturb the touching of the phone.

Also, instructions are really easy to understand. And I had to lift up the protector about 2 times before I got it perfectly on my screen. Even though I lifted it 2 times, there were no air bubbles.

I have been carrying around my phone with my keys but I have not noticed any scratches or cuts on my protector.

Do not hesitate to buy this product. I have bought several glass and regular protectors, but this product is the best. No scratches, cuts or dirtiness!! This is a great product.

"I typically have a little trouble with swimsuits because of my size. (5'1, 130, 36D) I'm a medium/large because of the girls. The colors in this suit are so vibrant and I can NOT wait to slay on the beach! The bottoms are a little loose but not big enough to cause any concern.

"We received this mount in excellent condition. It is made to hold a 32"" to 65"" TV.  The TV I needed it for is a 40"".  I had forgotten that it came with an HDMI cable and level so that was a pleasant surprise. The level is light weight and very handy.  Large enough to be effective, but small enough to keep handy.  I do like that the HDMI cable is included as generally when people are mounting TV's, they are switching to an HDMI capable television.

The instructions that came with the mount were clear and easy to read.  The bag of screws included were very identifiable in regard to their use.  The mount went up with no issues at all and minimal holes in the wall. It holds the TV very steadily and does offer a small tilt to it.  Thankfully I am married to someone who knows what he is doing.  I can easily see this being an issue if someone does not mount it on a stud with a large TV.  This wall mount is great for our needs and held out TV perfectly!  (please disregard the hanging cables in the pictures, we still need to run those into the wall).

This case provides excellent protection while looking nice too. It's a perfect fit for my S6 and isn't loose at all.  It's nice and snug and secure.  I often drop my phone and this protects it very well.  I was fortunate to receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my completely honest and unbiased review.,1
"Love this case! Durable, soft, comfortable and easy to use. By easy to use I mean it does not interfere with anything I am doing, it does not hinder me when I am charging the phone and it does not slide off the phone. I like that it seems like it would be easy to clean. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My favorite thing about it is the lip around my screen....I drop my phone a lot; maybe 6 times a day. Having a case that will protect the screen when I drop it is as important as having tempered glass on my phone. The lip makes it so when it falls face down the impact is on the case lip and not on my phone. This helps with dings, nicks, scratches, and CRACKED SCREENS! I will always choose a case that is protective that way.",1
"These are good sports bras and an excellent value since you receive two in the package. I chose the gray and black ones, they are just as pictured on Amazon.

These sports bras fit as I expected them to. They of course give you an unattractive uniboob under your shirt, but that is true of just about any sports bra that I have tried, especially the ones like this that you pull over your head. I find the ones that have the zipper closure in the front give you a slightly more attractive body shape.

However, for the price of this two pack a little uniboob is worth it, especially if you are just going to the gym or for a jog around your neighborhood.

These bras seem to have moderate firmness and control - my boobs are WAY to giant since I am currently nursing a baby, so no matter which bra I wear I have to double up if I plan on any exercise other than walking.

I hope that you found my review helpful. Thanks for reading.

"I purchased these women's aviator polarized sunglasses by Yufenra. When I saw these I really liked the design, the arms of the sunglasses have a nice design to them.

"My husband wears a size 38 and that's what I ordered.  It fit well.  His comment was ""Move over L.L. Bean!""

The style of these cargo shorts is a slimmer cut in the thigh than what you get from L.L. Bean.  And if your behind is very muscular or large, your regular size might be too tight.  It indents where the two buns meet, and I like that look.  My husband says its very confortable.  L.L. Bean cargo shorts do not show off that indent.

So far so good:  Looks good after a few washes.  Stitching is straight and there are two rows of it on each seam.  Stitching is reinforced at corners of pockets and other vulnerable spots.  Stitch ends are finished off nicely.  The shorts are nicely detailed and look good.

"These are comfortable and seem very durable. The extra large however is a lot smaller than other extra large gloves I've purchased. These were supposed to be for my husband, but they don't fit him. I normally wear a medium in mens gloves, but the extra large fits me. Make sure you take a look at their sizing guide! Other than the sizing issue, these are great! They have plastic gripping on the palm area and thick plastic guards on the knuckles. They also have a velcro closure around your wrists, so these are sure to stay put. I will be using these for camping and as work gloves around the house. I will update this review after this weekend as we are putting up a fence and I will be using these all weekend.

"This particular case is nice looking, but is flawed in functionality.

As I said, the case looks nice.  The design is sleek, and it doesn't have the ""cheap"" look that a lot of cases have.  There are a couple of problems though.

There is little protection from this case.  There are no cushioned corners, and the case doesn't extend past the screen much.  Dropping it screen down would provide virtually no protection, and the lack of cushion means the corners can be compromised as well.

The kickstand is a nice feature, but it does not work as well as it could.  Then it's closed, it never quite locks in place.  It is always moving a little, and tend to get caught on any loose thread or lint in my pocket.  It is also very difficult to lock open.  It almost feels like it will break before is in the open position.

Over all, this case is just okay.  It's not the worst, and not the best.  If you really want a kickstand, but don't necessarily need outstanding protection, this case would work.

I received this case free for evaluation and review.",1
"This is a super handy hammock.  It's made of rip stop fabric so it's very lightweight and compact.  The attached carrying bag is awesome and I love that it is sewn to the hammock so it can't be lost!  It is very easy to get the hammock back into the bag.  The bag itself has an adjustable clip on it so which can be used to compress the hammock further or attach the hammock pouch to a backpack.  The hammock itself is comfy and easily supports my 6'2"" husband.  My two kids (6 and 4) have plenty of space to relax in the hammock together.  One thing to note is that the hammock does not come with the daisy chain to hang it.  I highly recommend buying the daisy chain as well.  It has loads of connection points which allows you to hang the hammock to almost anything in no time.  I hung the hammock for the first time in under a minute.  Super easy.

I even carry it without a purse at times because it looks really pretty.

"I was honestly pretty disappointed with these gloves for a couple of different reasons. One of the first things I noticed when I opened them up was the low quality of the stitching. (can be seen in my photos). I had loose threads hanging around and visible knots. Generally for something that I expect to take a lot a use I want solid stitching that I won't have to worry about ripping. The rest of the glove materials seem pretty good.
As has been written in many other reviews as well as in the size chart for this product, these gloves run REALLY small. I usually wear XS to S sized gloves, and I measured my hand and came to right at 3 inches. Since I have small fingers and a small wrist I figured the S would work just fine, but I was very wrong. I managed to get the gloves on and they feel GREAT around my palm and wrist, though the wrist straps might be a little tight. The finger holes on the other hand were way too tight. They were honestly so tight that after a few minutes my fingers started turning blue. I left them on in the hopes that they might stretch a little with use, but once my fingers started changing colors I immediately took them back off. That makes these gloves absolutely unusable for me.
I can't say a whole lot to how well the grip works, because I wasn't able to try them out at the gym, but definitely buy a size up! And if you have meaty fingers I probably wouldn't bother with these at all.

"The Fast O Vacuums Vacuum Wine Saver Pump arrived with typical Amazon Prime speed. Its packaged with a plastic shell over a piece of glossy cardboard. There are clear and easy to follow directions (including photos) for using the Wine Saver Pump printed on the back side of the packaging card.

The pump feels sturdy and appears to be well made, it consists of a Stainless Steel tube with a brushed finish, the pull/pump handle is made of black ABS plastic.

Of the three bottles of wine that Ive opened since receiving Fast O Vacuums Vacuum Wine Saver Pump, each bottle required more pumps (almost double) to create the Feel of resistance created by the vacuum than is indicated on the product directions.
The product directions say:
 4 pumps for a 3/4 full bottle of 750 ml
 6 pumps for a 1/2 full bottle of 750 ml
 8 pumps for a 1/4 full bottle of 750 ml

We don't go through a lot of wine, probably because Im the only one who drinks it, and cant finish a whole bottle at one sitting. Well, I probably could technically finish a whole bottle at one sitting, but I wouldnt feel so great the next day. So rather than waste 1/2 to 3/4  of a bottle of wine we just wait until we have company to share it with.

Since receiving Fast O Vacuums Vacuum Wine Saver Pump I have been able to enjoy three different bottles of wine. I didn't let each one sit for up to two weeks to accurately test how well the vacuum seal held and kept the wine fresh. The longest period between sealing a bottle and reopening it was just two days. The vacuum seal cork was still sealed, and the wine was still very good.

Im enjoying being able to have a glass of wine with dinner and not worrying about the rest of the bottle going bad before it can be finished.

This set is great!  It came with everything we will need to play flag football at our birthday party.  I like the adjustable belts with the metal rings.  They will fit most kids or adults.  The three sliding Velcro tabs on each belt are perfect to put the Velcro ribbons on. In my set, the Velcro tabs were sewn well, both on the belt and the ribbons themselves.

Once the machine vacuum-packs meats, it's not always easy to tell what it is because it's packed so tightly - this is why I suggest writing the date & description on the item after I seal it.  Best thing I ever bought!  Let's me buy in bulk when meats are on sale and keeps them perfectly fresh forever!  Pays for itself 1000 times over!",0

"Although these are men's socks, they fit my foot really well. I have a large foot for a woman, but these fit pretty good. I bought them to wear with my Sperry's so I wouldn't get blisters and they work perfectly. They stay hidden pretty well and don't slip off the heel because of the small (soft) rubber at the heel.

"I was look for some spare connectors to use with my Nexus 6p and I chose to give the Type C Adapter, Aerb [2 PACK] USB 3.1 Type C to Micro USB Convert Connector a try. These connectors work great with my spare chargers to convert any mini USB to a type C charger for my Nexus 6p.  They feel for durable and light weight at the same time.  I can keep one in my desk at work and one in mg GO bag when on the road.  I really like these converters and recommend them to anyone who needs extra connectors without taking up too much space in your bag.

"I could not be happier with my Norocos casual sandals, they look very elegant but let's face it, we men opt more times then not for comfort vs. looks; this sandals surprisingly deliver on both. In the past it seemed like men's flip flops, sandals could not be comfortable and look nice, I have always had a hard time finding  sandals that I could wear on any occasion and still be comfortable for my feet. Well it seems the wait is over.

I have gone out to several places, including the movies and the beach, and to my surprise the sandals have passed both test, on looks and comfortable, I have actually received a few compliments on the sandals from both females and males. In my book that is a total win, the sandals are comfortable enough to wear all day and I can wear them on almost any casual occasion. In my case, I get the added bonus that, I can wear them almost all year around since I live in hot, Florida!

I like they way the sandals are crafted and the material all around, looks very well built and durable ( but only time will tell).

The only thing I did not like, is the smell the sandals had when I first took the, out of the bag, they had a very strong smell of PVC glue or something similar. Fortunately, the smell went away within a few days.

These sandals are a homerun, ladies these make for a great gift for that special men in your life.

"I am so pleased with my new case!! I love the texture on the case, it really does help me to hold onto it better!! The shiny to the case is absolutely beautiful!! One thing I noticed, the holes are a little bit larger, which is fantastic. Alot of us women with larger fingers cant get our fingers in those tiny little factory case holes. This case makes is easy! It also ships lightning fast. I love the color on the cases, they seem to have a brightness to it, that I just adore. This case just seems to have a bit more quality put into it than the other cases I have had in the past, it is much firmer and the ends of my case are so shiny. They look polished. I will definitely recommend this case to others, Im very impressed. It fits like a glove, you do feel a snap and you know your phone is not coming out of there, its slim design is nice also. They did not skimp on safety, very good case! I received this item free or reduced in exchange for a honest review, and I honestly can tell you guys, you won't feel sorry you bought it, its a quality, fantastic case!! Dont waste your time and money with cheaper more inferior products!! I truly expected to pay so very much more. You can just tell a difference with this case and cheaper cases. Look at them side by side, check the color and the strength of the case. Its hands down better than any case I have ever owned. When you pay so much for a phone, don't take any chances on cheaper cases that don't fit as well as these, and don't help you grip",1
This saw is amazing!! We just started camping and it's honestly a must have item for any camping trip! This is so compact so I don't have to worry about it taking up room in my trunk. (I have three kids and a small car lol)  room is tight! My 16 year old enjoyed cutting wood from fallen trees with this saw. It was sharp enough that he didn't have to struggle. He enjoyed it so much. This saw is very sharp so makes sawing a breeze. It's folding is amazing I love that it fits in a convenient carrying case. This is one of the most helpful items I've purchased in a long time! We are going camping soon agian and this is going to save us so much moneyou.

"I just lost my favorite pair of sunglasses and began browsing Amazon for a replacement.
I couldn't find the exact pair that I had any longer, but came across this pair by Poshei, and ordered them.
The delivery was quick, and the item was packaged very well.

After using the sunglasses for a few days here are a few comments on the item.
- These are true polarized lenses.  I have worn polarized lenses in the past and can say with a surety that they are Polarized.
- Very nice soft shell carry case is included in the order.  It was a nice unexpected extra
- Cleaning cloth and small bag were included in the order.
- The clips hold the glasses on your nose are easily movable and have a soft covering to them so they very comfortable.
- The glasses fit nice and tightly to my face, and don't move around so these are great for anyone who is active, or playing sports.
- The material is good quality, these glasses seem like they can take a beating.
Overall I'm very happy with these sunglasses and am glad I ordered them.

"These are large lights! Finding how to install batteries and turning these things on is tricky! I had to pull the instructions from the box on how to activate these flash lights. And even afterwards I am scratching my head and wondering where the screw is that the illustration shows. Kind of reminds me when I first saw a Artichoke and tried to figure out what part is edible. I am sure the lights are fine and I will update this. If they are as good as I think they may be. I may buy a couple more sets of these lights. I just don't like when a product is made and you need to break out the tools to get it working, especially for flash lights! UPDATE: I am knocking two stars off because the instructions are worthless at not explaining how to remove the flexible silicon material off or cutting it off! Someone made a video explaining that the material needs to be pulled over the lights and removed for access! I was going to use a Xacto Knife to cut this material around the battery compartment! Dimples needs to clarify and simplify the battery installation instructions!",0
"I have used this roll twice now and so far so good. They seal using my foodsaver very well.they are thinner than the food saver brand but work well. I haven't frozen anything using these yet. They seem to hold the seal well, they are well priced and I like that they have a white label place on the side to write on so you can mark the bags well with what's in them, and the date it was bagged. I like that as opposed to just writing on the clear part of the bag itself. I always mark stuff so I can remember what it is and when it was frozen or refrigerated. That way I do know which ones are older if I have a few bags of the same thing. I buy a lot of things in bulk in SAMs club and BJs and use my foodsaver a lot, so it's great to save some many onlooker costing bags. As I already stated they are thinner and I haven't frozen anything using these yet but they have done well for my refrigerated salads, cheese and leftovers.

"This is a very nice flashlight which has additional mounting to work as a bike headlight, too!  The flashlight is machined aluminum which makes it quite hefty.  The treads line up nicely and there are rubber gaskets which makes it waterproof.  The front lens can slide forward/back so that you can change the flashlight from a wide flood to a long distance narrow beam.  Its quite convenient to have a single flashlight be able to work indoors/up close and outdoors.  There are 3 levels of brightness, a strobe function, and an SOS blinking pattern.  The flashlight remembers the last mode you are in, too.  The handle bar mount is simple to use, a minor complaint is that a hex wrench is needed to fully tighten it onto your handlebar, would have made more sense if it was a phillips or flathead screw.  The direction of the mount can be changed by twisting the top portion, too.

"Dissatisfied with this battery! Windows 7 shows only one battery not 3! There are three rows which should house 3 batteries each for a total of 9-Cells. See my photo insert. Windows also has a problem reporting the actual time the charge will last.

When it was fully charged, Windows reported I only had 1 hour and 30 minutes until the battery was fully discharged. The battery has been running closer to twice that time and is about 50% discharged now. As long as I have around 5 to 6 hours run time on a single charge I'll be satisfied with keeping this battery. However, I will never buy this battery again. It seems to be more like the quality level of a third-party refurbished part rather than a new one and it feels like a ""bait and switch"" deal on top of it.

I did fit my Dell E6420 correctly. I charged it before I used it for the first time with the computer off. My advice to anyone asking me about this battery will be not to buy it.",0
Amazing...that is really what I say about this blade. It cuts so fast and easy it really amazed me. This is one of their thinner blades that is great for those detailed cuts.

"Great quality and a great bargain.

Need I say more?

Well, of course I should. lol

For starters, just a couple months ago, one of our daughters bought an almost identical pet car safety belt at a big-chain pet store for over $20. Yes, just one for over $20. Here, of course, you get one for about 60% less.

I have compared this $20+ safety belt with this one from Glow Castle. There is virtually no difference. The one from Glow Castle is designed nearly identically, is clearly just as well made and strong, is just as easily adjustable, and fits inside of the car's receiver buckle just as smoothly and conveniently.

Indeed, if it weren't for the fact that the two different brands happened to be different colors, you would assume that the two were made by the same high-quality brand.

Anyway, we've used our new pet safety belt numerous times already--for our 16-year-old, 15 lb. Terrier mix--and we couldn't be happier. We especially couldn't be happier because, prior to using a safety belt, our Terrier mix, Buddy, didn't even like riding in a car! (Fyi, Buddy was a rescue, and we adopted Buddy when he was already 7 years old. We were never sure why he had an aversion to riding in cars.)  In fact, with his incessant whining and barking while in the car, we didn't enjoy him riding in the car as much as he apparently didn't enjoy it either! lol  So he rarely did join us for car rides, except for things like vet appointments. I mention all of this primarily to make my next point about this seat belt.

It's not only worked like a charm for us, but it's had the unexpected yet most welcome effect of calming Buddy down while he's in the car and secured by a safety belt. No more incessant whining! It really seems obvious to us that the addition of the safety belt has made Buddy feel much more secure and confident--which not only gives Buddy and us great peace of mind, but also makes the Glow Castle safety belt worth way more than the little it cost us. Thus we believe the simple addition of the pet seat belt has had a radically positive effect on Buddy. We only wish we had tried using a safety belt much, MUCH sooner! (And not just because it has made Buddy feel more secure and relaxed; but also because it's the best thing to do safety-wise.)

No, we don't think there's anything inherently ""magical"" about the Glow Castle safety belt itself.  Any good quality safety belt would have rendered the same positive results with Buddy. Nonetheless, considering its inexpensive price point, we're very happy with the quality and performance--and results--of Glow Castle's Pet Car Safety Seat Belt. It certainly works great for our small dog. We highly recommend it and would certainly buy it again--whether for ourselves or as a gift for a friend or relative.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED review of it. And that's what I've truly given you. Discounts and freebies don't sway my opinion in the least.  And we have no connections whatsoever with Glow Castle or any of its employees.

"I would have given this a 5 star if it would have fit me. This was way too small, we ordered a XXL and it is more like a Junior size than adult or atleast a Woman's size 10. It was my own fault for not reading the reviews but my oldest daughter (almost 14) Loves it and it is shorter than the picture shows fitting my daughter who is 5.2 more like a long blouse. Other than being Way too small this was an excellent blouse, well made with very nice stitching & quality materials that feel smooth on the skin, Beautiful design. This is an really good product but just take the sizes as junior instead of adults and order it for really, really small women or kids.

"So the MYNT is pretty cool. It looks good. It feels good. It's really exactly the right size. Any smaller, it would be easy to lose, but hard to use. Any bigger, and it... well, it just wouldn't be so nice to use.

It does exactly what it says it does. In fact, it really does a remarkable combination of things with just a single programmable button. (Yes, you can even go forward AND backward in a Powerpoint / Keynote presentation -- with a single button. You can also raise AND lower your volume.)

Yes, the range is short -- but that's a limitation of the Bluetooth standard. So far, my battery is doing fine. But, it does come with a spare, just in case.

Here's the problem I have with it -- and this may be what's contributing to other people's battery life issues: On the Android, this device pairs as an ""input device"". Which means, that, while I have no problem simultaneously using my headset or other Bluetooth devices, the phone itself thinks I'm using a Bluetooth keyboard. And, because of that, it's not only telling me that I just connected a keyboard, every time I get within range of my MYNT, but it also takes away the predictive text on my soft-keyboard. (You know. the autocomplete that can be both mind-bogglingly inappropriate, but also is the only reason no one's marching in the streets demanding our Blackberry-style keyboards back.

The good news is this: All it takes is a software and/or firmware update. And, one more idea for Slightech, while you're tinkering under the hood: If you're going to make this an ""everything device"", why not add a panic button option (alarm + auto-dial 911 on speakerphone) while you're at it? That's just one more reason to keep it handy.

So, I like it enough -- especially in terms of hardware design & features, that I'll come back and revise my rating and review, as soon as the input-device problem has been solved. In the meanwhile, it's a great device to own, but unfortunately, not one I can keep paired to my phone all the time -- YET.

That said, I've owned an tried other devices in the general categories that this device covers, and while many share the same issues, they don't share the combined functionality. I'm rooting for this product.

This is the 7th Jumbl item I have sample, and I find I like their items pretty well overall. They have some really good pet lines, and they were one of the first companies to offer good LED pet lights for a good price. Of the items I have, 5 of them have been with me for 6 months of longer, and all of them work. THAT is a huge thing when you consider and item, too, because you want it to last.

What you have here is a solid wooden implement, with a upper chambered design. The chambers are deep enough to put pet treats into or to add in food or even a really small toy. The wooden 'wheels' or seals on the top are sturdy within the design and do not come loose, and the lip securing them to the base is a good length, so pets cannot easily remove it. It has bright coloration to it and the colors do not fade or flake, and the entirety of the design is wood. This cleans easily after use and is pretty resistant to claws or teeth, which was something I had initially wondered about.

Honestly, this has been a pleasant surprise when it comes to item design because it not only works, but the design can withstand the excitement a pet displays as it tries to find a treat. That is one of the good things about the material used, because wood can withstand a lot , and it is safe for your pet to be around.  It works for pets of different sizes and different types, too; I originally wondered if this would work for a cat and was skeptical when trying it out, but the cat actually seemed to enjoy using it. I knew a dog would like it (and they did), but having both enjoy it was really nice.

Another thing I like with this is that it allows for pet interaction, PLUS it has allowed my daughter to have fun with them. She is 2 1/2, so telling her to place a treat under the yellow symbol helps her while also making it a fun thing for her with the animals. Now, convincing her it was not some type of kid's toy was harder, but that also says something on the overall quality of the material and design.",1
"I thought it would be great to have cameras at the house and amcrest bragged that it was easy to set up with their app. Well it isn't. I thought I would give them a chance to get their app right but unfortunately I do not think they have plans of making it right. What good are cameras if you can not see them on your smart phone? Do not buy these cameras because there are other companies out there that have apps that will work with their cameras. So go with another company, investigate all the companies out there and make sure you choose a company that actually works as they say it will. I gave them 3 stars because the cameras are good for what they are but I will probably buy a new system that will actually work with my phone.",0

"I was in desperate need of a new wallet, I was using a canvas wallet that I received as a gift but it was used well beyond it's time and was beginning to look awful. I really like the Women's Small Compact PU Leather Wallet, it has worked wonderfully for me so far. There are spaces on both sides for credit cards, a window for ID cards in the middle, a large area for bills and a zippered change purse on the outside. The credit card spaces were a little snug at first because I have quite a few reward cards and credit cards in there but it became easier to remove them after a few uses. I keep the majority of them on one side and the ones I use all the time on the other side with ID and Drivers license in the middle. I really like that the coin purse is on the outside so I do not need to open my entire wallet when my kids ask for a quarter for a machine or to change to donate. The exterior of the wallet is really nice as well, it appears to be made of quality leather and seems very durable with nice stitching and a lovely pattern that compliments my purse. Great purchase, will definitely recommend to friends and family. Please note that I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

"Uniqhia No Tie Shoelaces for kids and adults are pretty awesome. One thing, they were a bit harder to put in then I expected at first. Another thing is my shoes have a weird flap that sticks out to allow the normal shoelaces to make the shoes fit a bit tighter as they are running shoes, so it would be nice to have more pieces of smaller sizes to fit a bit better. However, I really like them, my shoes fit pretty good now, and I love the fact that I do not need to tie my shoes anymore. Plus not having regular shoelaces is another nice thing, because the knots and the fraying was getting annoying, and almost impossible for me to be able to relace my shoes when my 2 year old decided to pull them out.

Great product. #NTiShoelacefoKidanAdults

When I received a sample to review, I saw how slim and small it was, and I wondered how it would test. So I applied a 3amp load to it and drained it down, then recharged it to full capacity. The first time I did this, the charge was over 9.1Ah, or 9,100mAh. Pretty good, considering you never can fully discharge this type of battery, nor full charge it. I tried it again. This time it charged to almost 9.5Ah. Awesome. A few more cycles and I'm sure it will hold the proclaimed 10,000mAh, which is very impressive, especially in such a slim, small package. OK, some details:

=It is charged via a microUSB port on the end of the battery. A cable is provided.
=It has three USB ports to charge smartphones, tablets, and so on, and I had no problems getting 3.5 amps out of any of the ports. They disconnected at four amps, but seemed find with 3.5 amps, which is more than spec and far more than you are likely to load it
=Slim enough to fit in a shirt pocket, small purse, laptop bag, you name it

Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the capacity and reliability of this battery. When I overloaded it, it simply shut down the connection until I removed the overload. Then the port being tested came right back up again under a lower load. Excellent. I must give these folks five stars for an impressive product.

Disclosure: sample provided for review, good or bad, but no matter how much I mistreated this battery, it took the punishment and kept right on going. Wow.",1
"UPDATE (May 24, 2016): Originally, I took off one star because I expected the fast wireless charging pad (connected to a QC 2.0 wall charger) to charge as efficiently as a direct wired connection. This expectation, I now understand, was mistaken, because a properly functioning charger's efficiency should be above 80%, while a pad's efficiency maxes out at 72%. Both because of my new understanding and because in practice I don't feel affected by the difference, I've upgraded to five stars. My original review appears below.

*********

The Choe Fast Wireless charger, model T518, appears to charge at the same speed as the original Samsung wired charger supplied with my Samsung Galaxy S7. According to phone notifications, from 30% remaining battery, both were estimated to require 1 hour and 28 minutes. In contrast, a direct wired connection to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BC-Master-18W-QC-2-0-USB-Wall-Charger/dp/B0186XZL9C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BC Master 18W QC 2.0 USB Wall Charger</a>&nbsp;I was using to power the Choe produced an estimate of 1 hour and 2 minutes. Frankly, I really don't know whether this is a good or bad result. So, I can't award five stars. But according to an Android Police article, there shouldn't be a difference, if the wireless charger is functioning efficiently. Perhaps someone more knowledgeable than I can help out.

Also, I'm not sure how valid the phone's estimates are. On another occasion, when the phone was at 63%, according to Ampere, the Choe took almost 90 minutes to get close to 100%. (I had to stop just before it reached 100%.) The progression is documented in the accompanying photographs.

But even if wireless chargers generally, or the Choe T518 in particular, are somewhat slower to charge than a direct, wired connection, most of the time, and especially over night, the convenience of not having to worry about flopping cables makes the difference for me. And if I need greater speed, I can disconnect the cable from the pad and plug it directly into the phone.

The Choe has a pleasing, well-made appearance. It's slightly smaller than my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pleson-C500-Fast-Wireless-Charging-pad/dp/B01D8D5NCA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pleson C500 Fast Wireless Charging pad</a>. But I haven't found it a problem to properly locate my S7 on the pad. One thing I do prefer about the Pleson is that it briefly flashes blue, when the phone is placed on the pad, and then briefly green to indicate fast charging.

I have not observed a phone-reported difference between my S7 without a case or in my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incipio-Area-Case/dp/B01EBFD13M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incipio Area Case</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diztronic-Voyeur-Series/dp/B01B38U49E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diztronic Voyeur Series</a>&nbsp;.

"I love scarves and this peach colored scarf was perfect for my collection. The seller offers a variety of different colors and I purchased the peach color. The scarf is a creamy, peachy color that looks very soft and delicate. The color makes this scarf a perfect accessory for the warmer seasons like summer and spring. The design of this scarf is so beautiful. It is a pretty leaf design on top of a lace back. The fabric is lace and has a teardrop fringe. The fringe is short yet still moves around. The scarf is pretty big, measuring at 10 by 68. The scarfs length makes it versatile in the style and design that you use it. Not only can this be worn as a scarf, but also as a shawl. Even though this scarf is relatively large, it is still very lightweight, breathable and super soft. The scarf is versatile and makes the perfect accent item to spice up any outfits whether it is a formal or casual occasion. While I had it on my husband actually gave me a compliment saying how attractive I look with the peach color scarf around my neck. The scarf makes a good addition to my collection and I cant wait to wear it to church tomorrow and to work next week. I received this discounted product in exchange for my honest review.",1

"I was looking for a small Bluetooth speaker to use at my desk, and I wasn't overly concerned with the sound quality because Im not really an audiophile, I didn't want to spend a whole lot, and I wasn't planning on playing it very loudly anyway. That said, this little speaker definitely outperformed my expectations.

The first thing that I noticed after unboxing it was how heavy and sturdy the speaker felt. This definitely isn't going to be easy to knock over when Im shuffling through stuff on my desk, which I appreciate.

It comes with a velvet carrying pouch, the charging cable, and a 3.5 mm cable you can use to plug a device into the speaker if the device doesnt have Bluetooth or you just don't want to turn Bluetooth on.

The charging cable is flat and has a little piece on it for wrapping it up and keeping it secure, and the 3.5 mm cord is braided nylon. Flat and covered cords have always performed infinitely better for me when it comes to lasting longer and not tangling, so I was glad to see those touches.

It comes with instructions, but it was a breeze to pair both with my Apple and Android devices. I tested it out with YouTube and several music apps and found the sound quality to be excellent for the price. It gets quite loud and has a decent amount of bass, especially at louder volumes. Again, I wouldnt say this is going to meet every audiophiles greatest expectations, but if you're looking for a decent little speaker for a desk or kids room, Id say this is a good investment.

I was also able to answer an incoming call from iPhone on the speaker with no issues, though I honestly probably will not use it much for phone calls because I don't like playing my phone calls out loud.

"Very nice squishy stress ball! I got this for my 80 year old mom, she tends to be very nervous and fidgety, and she is recovering from a stroke so I thought this would be perfect.

"Very pleased customer here. Seller put chain in small bag to decrease it's ability to tangle. The, bag was put inside a pretty yellow and purple box. I would have no problem gifting this to someone. The chain itself I am also pleased with. It is thicker than it looks in the picture on Amazon. The fact that it is a box chain makes it sturdier too than, say a flat style of chain.  It measures exactly 24"". I am keeping this chain. I wear the same necklace every day. I have two medal pendants on this chain and one Caribbean topaz pendant. I wear all three together. I had them on a very thin white gold chain. I was afraid it would hold it. It has, but I really wanted a 24"" chain instead of an 18"" chain.  The only thing that would have made this chain even better is a lobster claw clasp instead of the round clasp. I have acrylic nails and it is hard to open any small round clasp. But, when I did not have acrylics, it was fine.  I am very pleased with this purchase. I did receive this chain at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.",1

"My dogs are family, and all three of them are now over 8 years of age. Dogs are considered seniors when they reach the age of 7, and their needs change as they get older. I used to give my dogs a different vitamin, but my dogs didn't like the taste, and it contained grain. This senior multivitamin contains no grain or rosemary, so it is safe to give seizure dogs, and my dogs seem to really love them--even my little picky guy.

I cheat and give these to my dogs as a treat. I do that with their joint supplement also. I think they may be on to me, but they seem happy to be getting something, and I like giving treats that have a purpose instead of just empty calories.

The vitamins are largish, scored tablets, and are presented in a clear bottle, which is my only real issue with them. I have always heard that dark containers are best for preserving the quality of the ingredients. They are formulated by veterinarians, laboratory tested, and made in the USA, which for me is very important. The dogs and I all recommend these senior multivitamins.

I received the vitamins free in return for my honest review. My reviews are done in compliance with Amazon's TOS and FTC regulations, and I never guarantee a favorable review. I have personally tested this product.",1

"I read lots of reviews on this before I bought it.  I have to say that they were all right, both good and bad.  This grill cover fits my grill very well and it has lots of nice features.  It is made of a medium weight canvas like material.  It feels well made and heavy duty.

Unfortunately it doesn't hold up as well as I had hoped.  I have had it for about a year now and it is already showing significant wear.  Every place where it comes into contact with a corner of the grill the fabric is breaking down, tearing or in some other way turning bad.  It's not like it is falling apart but it sure isn't lasting.

The whole function of a grill cover is to add years of trouble free life to the whole grilling setup. At the best this cover might transfer some of the aging from the grill to the cover.  At worst it just increases costs and maintenance.  I won't buy another one of these.

This is unfortunate.  The cover is well designed and manufactured but it is made from the wrong materials.",0

"These mens shoes are nice. First impression is good and attracts the eye well. The shoe seems well made and even looks fancy when on. Material looks of good quality, flexible and soft to touch. The color on the grey shoes seems like it has a little shade of light blue, but still looks very nice with khaki! Shoes are light in weight and have clean stitching. Sole is not too heavy for the type of shoe, it seems like it is made out of a very sturdy gum sole. Shoes can be cleaned with a dry rag to remove dirt. I would recommend getting this type of shoes for men that are clean and like to look tidy since the color is light and they look way better when they are clean. My husband really likes these shoes, he usually uses a 12 or 13 in shoes and has a size 12 for these specific shoes. He reports that they slightly fit tight width wise and would recommend buying a size up from regular size.

"Mama's got a brand new favorite mug!! It's the mug I would have wanted to have at my office when I had to work in an office environment. Even though I no longer have to worry with that set-up for unnecessary human interaction (I'm a classic Introvert over here), the sentiment still rings true. I work from home for the same company so I still have coworkers and there are still stressful days. However, a cup of coffee/cocoa/green tea, etc. in this mug makes everything alright!

What's so great, is that if I drink using my right hand, the display faces the outside so the message can be conveyed to someone who is bringing some outside BS to your life (to your office, your school, your marriage, your whatever) and they can know to STOP...you don't have time for it. But if I drink using my left hand (ambidexterity rocks), the messages face toward you and it can serve as a calming, reminder chant. When stress piles high or something gets you out of sorts, stop, have a cup of tea with this mug, see that message, take it in as you breathe deeply and manifest that you do not have time to deal with BS today. To keep calm and keep going. Don't let petty people or petty tings bring you down or cause you to step outside yourself. You're bigger than the BS so don't give it any more of your time or focus.

This doesn't just go for the one I chose (No BS), but the one that says "" I Believe in Myself Like Kanye Believes in Kanye"" can let others know you have a high level of self-esteem or you can remind yourself to keep pushing toward a tough goal and knowing that if you feel like a king, you'll perform like one. The one that says, ""Sometimes All You Need is $500 Million"" would be perfect for someone like an inventor or someone who has a dream and all you need is the right investment. This would make for a great conversation starter mug at Starbucks. Someone reads it, you get to talking to them about your launch product, they get excited, decide to invest and VOILA! You're a little closer to your dream and that $500M you want/need. And the one that says, ""The Goal is to Retire Rich & Young"" is self-evident. You can let others know you're busy working because this is your goal. To yourself, you can remind yourself that this is the reason to keep pushing and busting your butt.

Now, I'd be kidding if I didn't say I wish they were bigger. I reaaaaaaallllllllyyyyy like tea and in this little bitty quantity, I would be getting up all day long to refill, but you can't have everything (or can you...can you guys make these same sayings on bigger mugs, please?) so I won't deduct for that. They are beautifully made. The matte black sure is classy. It's LOGO Heavy (their logo is on both the worded side and the opposite side. I think it would have been cute to add a stop sign to this one on the opposite side. Maybe an idea bubble on retire one, a crown or a heart on the Kanye one and a $ on the $500M one. Keep the logo on the worded side or also add it to the bottom. There is a large, comfortable handle which I like.

Ultimately, I love these. Such a cute idea and great sayings that can all be given to others externally or embraced internally. I received this mug at a discount for the purpose of checking it out, trying it and then submitting a honest, unbiased review. At this price point, though I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to have them all, I'd have to stick to picking one I loved the most. However, I absolutely recommend them. I might put these on my Gift List so if someone else wanted to gift them to me, they could.",1

"k9konnections Double Sided Dematting Brush for Dogs and Cats is a really great brush for my pets. This brush is a furbeast for pets.

Unlike my dog my cat loves to be brushed and I tried it on her to get rid of her loose hair and she just purred like she was getting a massage. I was really hesitant about getting this brush to try because of my experience with other brushes in the past however, this brush and its description is spot on, not just a bunch of words to get you to try their product. I will buy from this company again in the future for my pet needs.

"What a difference LED Halogen lights makes! We use these kind of light bulbs in our kitchen and they are mounted under the cabinets to give more light for the backsplash. Anyway, these LED Halogen lights do not put out any heat. The previous halogen light bulbs we used, did. Actually they gave out so much heat that sometimes they melted things. Like I had one of those lights right above the dish rack by my sink. The lid for my blender was on top of some stuff in the rack and the lid was on top and apparently too close to the halogen bulb, as it melted the plastic on parts of the lid. We put these LED halogen bulbs in place of the traditional halogen bulbs and what a difference. These put out no heat at all and are very bright and gives lots of light output. I also have a hook for my bananas mounted under the cabinets. Again the warm halogen lights, would ripen the bananas so much faster. Now when I am using these LED bulbs, the bananas are staying fresh longer. The LED bulbs looks exactly the same on the outside as traditional bulbs. It is easy to just snap in these bulbs and they start working right away. I am so happy to have found and will purchase again. Although LED lights hold up very well, that it will probably be a very long time until I need to replace them! There are five LED Halogen light bulbs in this set. I am very pleased and would recommend these to anyone needing these kinds of light bulbs. I was fortunate to receive these HERO-LED Halogen Light Bulbs free. In exchange I am giving my honest and unbiased review.",1
These measuring spoons are nice. The price for both sets was great. Love the colors!,0
"The way this fits any size umbrella is pretty cool. It felt very secure when I got it up. The speaker stayed in the same spot for hours without sliding down. It was very easy to use and figure out. I charged it with my phone charger before heading to the pool. Once I turned it on I was able I search on my phone and easily pair it. I did not expect it to talk to me when it came on and when it synced. It/she (it's a female voice) has a very strong accent I can understand it but obviously made overseas. The lights were cool. It lights up in quite a few different colors. The sound was good quality and loud. I really like how it doesn't take up space on the table. At night it lends a fun ""party"" feeling. The speaker is lightweight but doesn't feel super easy to break. If you can get over the loud accented voice I would recomend it. I received this product for a free or discounted price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are my own and solely my own.",1

"Fits my waist and is adjustable.  Ive used belts in the past that were not as adjustable.  I tried wearing it at work where I am in an office.  For some reason after I used it I have had itching.  I didn't wash it when new and put onvright away.  I wish it was wider , but the site is very clear on what the width is.",0
The jeans look good and fit perfectly. The only thing is that after the first wash it felt tighter on the waist. Next time I'm getting one size bigger on waist. Overall their a great pair of jeans.,0

"I wanted to make sure that I tested the product for a while before posting a review. At first, I got really frustrated with the user interface and was ready to throw this in the garbage. Then I decided to step away from it for a bit and return later. I had difficulty getting it to sync with the app, but then I found the setting in the NVR that gives you the QR code that makes it connect. (Settings -> Network -> P2P Setting) (Also, with the mouse, right click is back/exit)

I am not sure why, but when I connected my third party cameras directly to the NVR, they would not work and could not be seen by the NVR. When I had them attached to my router I could see them in the list and then successfully log in. It took a lot of trial and error getting this set up, but the time spent setting it up was worth it. I have two Amcrest cameras attached to this directly, in addition to an Onvif spy cam and Bullet Cam. It is really nice having all of my security cameras recording in one place. I only had a 500GB drive laying around, but now that I have this configured and working properly, I am going to purchase and install a 4TB drive.

After the initial frustration of setting this up, I am very happy with the performance and the product. Yes, there are things that they can do to make it better, but it is a great product. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",1
"This is a must have item for me. I have a TV with only 2 HDMI hookups in the back of the TV which is used by the cable box and the DVD player. So whenever I want to hook up anything else like my laptop, I have to unplug one of those items. My TV is mounted so I literally have to take my tv off of the wall to do this. With this 3 port switch I can leave it plugged in and easily plug up to 3 additional devices into it. This has made everything so much easier. It works great and the picture quality is exactly the same as plugging directly into the TV. It was literally plug and play so the set up is easy too. I received this item at a discount or for free to give my honest and unbiased review. I'm extremely pleased with this item and I have needed this for a long time.",1

"This is a collapsible lantern that is sturdy and attractive (the one I got is red with black accents).

I appreciate all the different options for powering this light up - batteries (3 AA batteries not included); a solar charging panel on the top; a detachable cord to plug into your 110 volt wall socket; and a USB port (for charging the lantern). The lantern itself can NOT be used as a power bank.

To use the light, pull on the bail wire handle and the lantern separates, with six LED lights shining brightly. They appear even brighter because the bottom of the inner lantern is reflective, reflecting the lights outward and putting out a lot of light.

I wish the wire handle unhooked from one side, so you could slip this around a branch or tent pole.

So far I've used the solar panel for charging with the AA batteries as back-up and have been satisfied.

I received this lantern in exchange for my unbiased review.",1
"This is an excellent light duty cutting board.  It is a good size if you are cutting/dicing vegetables or smaller pieces of meat (for example, I don't think it is big enough if you was cutting a whole chicken).  Cutting board did not slide during use.  One of the better looking boards I have seen in a while.

Only drawback is that the knives leave marks on the board a little too easy.  I expect this to happen as normal wear and tear but you could see little indention marks (not even close to call it a gouge mark) after the first couple of uses.

 Please note that I did received this product as a free offer, but this did not influence this review.",1
"Our old iPhone started to get some sort of sensitivity and would auto-mute whenever you talked on it so we could only use it on speakerphone. This case is perfect because you can talk on the phone even when the case is closed so the phone doesn't go to mute.

"Zhuanglin's Women's Quick drying shoes do meet expectations. They arrived within days of the order on a drawstring plastic bag. I tried them on and they fit well. When I used them in the pool, they did dry quickly. They are great for around the pool. I haven't used them on the beach or walking along the boardwalk yet, so I'm not sure how long they will be comfortable (I'll find out soon enough). I recieved the pink pair and they are bright, however will accent all of my bathing suits well. I am very happy with these shoes and recommend them.

"This running belt worked really well for my use. I like to hike, and while I often bring a backpack, sometimes on my shorter hikes a backpack is a little too bulky. However, I need to use something to hold my things, as my clothing rarely contains pockets, a woe women know well. Fanny packs are out of the question--I'm too style conscious. This belt fits my phone (iPhone 6), earbuds, tissues, eyedrops, and some candy to suck on (anyone who has hiked knows the woes of cotton mouth.) Of course, the less you put in it the less bulky it is, so on just a walk or run I might just put my phone in it. It was big enough to sit on top of my hips--however, in this position it kept sliding up. It sort of settled on my waist, and that was fine for me. I'm not too bothered by the fact it doesn't stay on the hips as I don't realistically believe there could be any product that wouldn't shift up on me unless it was lined in silicone. Something else to point out is that not only does it shift up, it also tends to twist together and bunch at the sides and back. This is something to note. Another downside is the putting it on part. Since it's a stretchy band, you either have to pull it up like pants or down like a shirt. My butt is far too large to even consider putting it on from below, so I had to pull it down from above, which also requires a bit of twisting and wiggling for me. I don't have wide shoulders but they certainly aren't slim, and my bust is relatively ample, so it was somewhat of a squeeze, but still manageable. Taking it off is even harder since after a hard workout on me it tends to be a bit damp, and my skin is sticky from sweat, so as anyone who has taken a damp sports bra off can relate, it can be a bit of a hassle.
I ordered a size M, and my high hips are 39 inches (this where the belt is supposed to rest, around where your hip bones are). My waist is 29 inches and that's where the belt tends to migrate. I have an inkling this could be because it might be too small? It does fit on my hips and waist well, not too tight, but I wonder if I had sized up if it would have stayed on my hips better. Since it's stretchy, the size M works fine.
I've found this belt can be easily thrown in the washer and dryer, which is great! It didn't shrink for me, but I do wash with cold water. Overall I'm satisfied with the quality and happy to use it for hiking! Women's clothing often lacks pockets, so that's where this belt can be really helpful, so you can take things with you without having to hold it or bring a backpack/fanny pack.

I received this product at a discount to provide an honest review. I am unbiased, and my opinion of the product would be the same regardless of if I paid listed price or not. Although, I will point out that I think the actual full price of $35 is waaay too much for the product. However, I haven't seen it listed at full price since I've received it. The product listing has stayed around $10-13 and I think that price is justified.",1
Still working around with it. I like it a lot. First time having an ASUS system.,0
"This is a very beautiful bamboo knife block. Knowing this was made of bamboo, I didn't expect for this block to be so sturdy and heavy. Bamboo in its natural state isn't that heavy, but when you cut pieces and make a solid block it's heavier and sturdier than you might expect. This is a very well made wooden block. Our block didn't have any flaws in the woodwork.
About the very bottom row where others have said their steak knives hit the tabletop or counter, we placed 2 different brands of steak knives and one didn't hit the bottom but the other did. What you could put in these 4 slots instead, is paring or cheese knives, or any other shorter blade knife.
As soon as we received this we treated the wood with mineral oil two times, this will keep the wood healthy looking and from drying out.

"I look with envy at the lush locks of other people's babies. I give birth to baldies, who stay bald until at least their first birthday. So, I have to buy head ornaments for my girls. These are cute, and come in several colors. For some reason when I see a turban headband, it brings to mind old fashioned scenes of women hanging laundry to dry on a clothesline, or scrubbing it in an old washtub. These are adorable on my 10 month old baby girl though, and the price includes six different colored headbands in pastel colors.

"Pretty good light.  Not the best but its ok.  The light is bright but the motion sensor leaves much to be desired.  Its not that accurate on sensing things.  I have been using this for about a month now and its been the same the whole time.  Its completely dependent on solar to power so it can only be used outside.  Its lightweight and easy to install anywhere outside that you prefer.  Comes with everything you need to properly install and get the light to work.

 Installs easily in seconds; just peel and stick to any surface (bricks, stucco, siding, wood, metal, glass etc.) Or Screws and a hinge are provided and no complicated wiring is necessary.
 Durable, weather-resistant & heatproof plastic construction
 Ultra-Bright: High-powered LEDs provide excellent illumination of up to 80 lumens. This is bright enough to turn night into day and provide security for your home or business.
 Eco-Friendly: Our light is charged through the day by exposure to sunlight. Its Li-ion can provide 12 hours of illumination at night from just 7 hours of charging during the day.
 AUTOMATIC: The light features a PIR motion sensor that is activated when movement is detected within 3 m / 15 ft. If no further movement is detected during the 10 seconds that the light is on, Auto on at night / auto off at sunrise; Dim light when no motion / Bright light activates when sensing motion",1

"I've been carrying around a small wallet...very small, in fact, with just enough room for 6 cards and some cash.  But I'm running out of room

This sturdy, well constructed leather wallet is BIG.  19 compartments in all...two with zippers!  And yet, it fits nicely in my jean pocket.

I have only positive things to say about this wallet: solid stitching, comfortable leather, and plenty of room for everything you might want to carry in a wallet.

I suppose if you wanted to find something to take issue with, it would be the lack of photo slots.  If you want to carry around pictures of your family, I suppose you will miss those photo slots.  But if you carry photos around on your phone, then there really is no need.

Just know, however, that this is a BIG wallet compared to many others.  That is a primary reason to consider this one over others.  See the photo I've included for a comparison of my small wallet and this one.

Reviewer's note: I received this wallet free for the purpose of testing and reviewing.",1
"I was disappointed in this phone case because even though it looks nice, it just is way too tight on my phone. I have the iPhone SE which is exactly the same size as the 5s, with just different inner workings so it should fit my iPhone SE perfectly.

I really love the look of the case. I got it specifically for this phone and was excited when I saw the look and feel of it. In order to slide my phone in, I had to really push and push. Then when I put the bottom part on, it just felt like it did not fit. It was slightly raised where they met as though it was too small for the phone.

I thought I was going to have to break the case to get it off my phone. I was able to slide the bottom piece off but the rest was totally stuck. I had to pull the sides out and have someone else help grab the phone and pull as hard as they could. I was also afraid I could damage my phone trying to get the case off.

I can not in good conscience recommend this phone case at all. Maybe mine was defective but it's just way too small and tight a fit. I also noticed a few other reviewers said that, but for me this is a deal breaker. I do not want a case that I might have to break or damage my phone to remove.

Thanks for reading my review

"I have received this product as a discount in return for an honest review. With that being said, these things are infinitely cooler than I would have ever thought! The lights themselves are plastic, but there are tiny bubbles in the bulbous tips that make the light reflect off in the coolest ways. The lights themselves are about 3"" long and the perfect brightness. One of my favorite features of this item is how many different strobe/lighting options there are. I think there at least four. Don't worry. If you're not into any of that flashy stuff, you have the option to just have all of the lights on at one time with no bells and whistles. If you are into that, my favorite option is what I call ""cascade."" The light ""trickles"" down the plastic bulb in a way that reminds me of water droplets. It looks extra great with the design of each light.

Some side notes: It comes with everything needed to get the lights started up as soon as you get it. You press the ""ON"" button and it turns on! Now, the charge is not very long, but it is charged enough for you to test out all the different settings.

Cons: I wish the strand was a bit longer. I was only able to strand a single line across one bush (around 5-6 feet wide). You'll be needing several of these to cover the front of a house or even your front shrubs.",1
"First thing to note: It is tiny. Without the waterproof case it measures less than 2"" by 2 1/2"". Honestly, I will probably never have it out of the case because the camera seems too small to fit your hands well without it. It is very simple, button wise. Takes just about five minutes to figure out all of the functions and comes with a quick start guide if you need it. The packaging it come in definitely makes you feel like you spent big bucks on it. It has very wide view lens, which is neat. I can sit on my couch and get a good picture of my entire living room end to end. I'll be updating this review in about three weeks after a vacation to the ocean- I bought it specifically for that purpose, having always used my iphone for pictures up until now. I obviously couldn't take the iphone to the ocean with me, so i'm really exited to put this little fella through the paces and see what it can do. Underwater and all. See you in three weeks with an update!

"Our mattress is 7 years old. It is soft but lumpy. I have been looking for ways to improve it without having to buy a whole new mattress. I received this mattress topper free from the manufacturer as a product test, and it has been the perfect solution. I was waking up each morning with a lower back ache and after 3 nights of sleeping on this topper I have had no problems! It is soft but provides just the right amount of support. I feel if you were dealing with an overly hard mattress this would also be a lifesaver! It comes nicely packaged, takes 48 hrs to fully expand, then you are good to go. Adds a few inches on top, but still works great with my queen sized sheets. It looks beautiful and feels high quality. I love it and would highly recommend.",1

"This review is for the blue and yellow hard glasses case. I am overall quite happy with it, it's protective, the colors are very consistent with what's on screen and bright. The hinge seems to be sturdy, which is an area I always check as it seems to be the area that wears out the most (due to its' moveable nature). The interior is roomy enough for regular glasses and potentially some slimmer sunglasses but this definitely won't hold the big sun glasses that are in style right now. I even broke some out from my last trip to Florida and it was definitely too tall. Width wise was fine but the big lenses just won't fit. Mine wasn't even close.

I actually got these for my daughter's first pair of glasses as I could just see her losing them or breaking them and being heartbroken over it, so this was absolutely a preventative measure. I've had these now for about 4 months and they're holding up nicely. There's one small scratch but that's about it - I call that a win with how hard I'm sure my daughter is on these.

As a note; I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I know those reading the reviews are looking for the best product for their money and I do the same so how much I paid (or didn't pay) for something never comes into play. I'm happy to answer any questions about the product as I never review it until I am convinced I know enough about it!",1
"The most important thing to note here if you ask me is that these are Ultra light weight fashion glasses.

It has an acrylic lens that is crystal clear and also has UV400 Transparent Lens Technology, which according to the manufacturer this added bonus absorbs over 99% of harmful UVA and UVB spectrums. I am not a scientist (shocking, right?) so I can not confirm or deny these claims but as a consumer it sounds pretty darn good and reeled me in.

I have to come clean here, I do personally wear RX lenses so I did not buy these for me, I bought them for my three and a half year old to add to his costume trunk ad he LOVES role playing and I knew he would love these!

We have only had these for a day and so far he has been Mommy (thats Me haha), Sherman from mr peabody and sherman and Simon from Alvin and the chipmunks. I would post a photo of him in these glasses because he is super adorable in them but I'm weird about posting pictures of my kids on the internet. You never know if Jarred is looking, if you catch my drift. So instead I threw them on, long enough to take the picture because he wanted them back quickly.

"I bought this mattress protector in hopes of having something to keep my mattress safe of any spills, stains, etc. I've never had a bed without one. When looking at this item, I was pleasantly surprised at the reviews. Many people seemed to approve and even highly suggested this item. Because I always read the reviews before buying an item, I must admit, I was completely sold on this product. The description and customer opinions were exactly what I was hoping for. Fast forward two days after ordering, the package came. I opened it up and really appreciated how well it was shipped to me. In my opinion, the packaging is very important. All in all, no complaints in this department. After opening the product, I hurried to strip the bed so that I could put this protector on. I noticed after the first night that this item would be something that I will be purchasing again. One to have on the bed now and one to put on when I strip the bedding and wash laundry. This protector is very comfortable. It's not like some that feel like your laying on plastic. It's very comfortable. I have to mention the fact that I did test it out! I brought a glass of water into the room and slowly poured it onto the middle of the bed. I had one end of the protector up and ready to pull if any water leaked through. However, that was NOT the case at all! The water never even touched the bed. Not only that, but it's almost like the water sat atop of the protector.

"Wonderfully packaged. Super fast delivery. Item exactly as seller described. I hope to do business with this seller again! Thank You! I ordered these boots for my youngest daughter. She doesnt like wearing regular winter boots, and always has issues finding ones that fit her wide feet comfortably. I have always had a hard time getting her to wear boots. She complains about how tight they are on her calf, or they're too heavy. She usually wears a 6.5 so we ordered a 7 to give her extra space for thick socks to keep her feet warm. There is no extra room, but since she does have quite wide feet, & it's only a half a size difference, I couldn't see subtracting a star for that. We got them quickly, and were happily surprised at how attractive they are, & such nice quality. We think they are way nicer than the pictures! She says they feel like they will help keep her feet nice and warm for winter here in Maine. I will be getting a spray on conditioner to assure that they will be waterproof so that she can use them for the winter without her feet getting wet, and cold.

"So happy with my purchase of these shoes! Came in today super comfortable, way better than I was expecting! I am going to buy another pair because they are such a reasonable priced flat shoe. They also look amazing on! I wear a 5.5 size shoe and I did order a 5.5 and they fit amazing. Super great basic flat!",0
"A nice circular scarf. Personally I love these as head scarfs to wear when the car windows are down or just really windy days. Gives you that Marilyn Monroe feeling. And of course it keeps your hair from flying all over and beating you half to death! That really keeps down the tangles for us girls with super long hair!
There are a lot of neat ways you can wear one of these. The material is thin enough to wear spring, summer, and fall. I'm a big girl and there is enough room to wrap over my head and neck doubled. The color and design of this scarf is interesting and pretty unique. It seems well made, there are no loose threads. It comes in a pretty white screen pull tie baggie.
I received this free in exchange for my honest opinion and review. My review is based on my experience and thoughts on this scarf. I hope you find it helpful.",1

I absolutely love this!

This is such a cute style and its a little on the sexy side without being too revealing which works great for girls like me that maybe have a little extra padding.  I sometimes have problems with one pieces because I have a larger bust, but man, this bathing suit does amazing things for my bust.  It looks awesome! Its definitely form fitting, but its got a nice tight fit that kinds of smooths your imperfections and looks fantastic.

I ordered the XL, which is listed as a 10-12. Im generally a 12.a 14 on bad days, but this is a fantastic fit.  Even with my larger bust this is a good fit.  The top has a little padding which I don't generally like, but I do with this suit.  The material is great, its made very well, and I love the style and how it looks on me.  I have nothing but great things to say about this suit!

"Another fabulous charm-bracelet accessory from Timeline Treasures! I love the silky, shiny black color of these spacer beads. They go perfectly with my black snake charm bracelet (also from Timeline Treasures). These spacers are just the thing for putting between my glass beads and charms. My order of these black spacer beads came with eleven beads, which I've found, is a good number when making up a bracelet. The pretty gift bag packaging is nice as well, and also works well for storage of extra spacers. All in all, I am very happy with these beads and am excited to put them on my bracelet. I was given the opportunity to purchase these spacer beads at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I rely heavily on customer reviews when making purchases on Amazon and know you do, too. That's why I will come back and update a review, if necessary. Thanks so much for reading my review.

"We just bought a new house and going from a rental where you can't change much to owning your own home where you choose how you want to landscape. The previous owners did not keep the yard groomed very well. We have quite a few shrubs and bushes in the front of the house that need to be trimmed. With arthritis and carpal tunnel it is important that I found a pair of shears that were comfortable, sharp for easy cutting, and ones that can easily be clenched. These shears do all of that. They are very sharp and cut easily. Even on the thicker branches I could cut them without too much trouble.

The ergonomic design makes them more comfortable, and the padded handles are soft. I also have small hands and the wider the handles are apart the harder it is for me to grip them, but with these I didn't have any trouble gripping them.

I absolutely LOVE this Klear Bottle 18oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle in Pink.  I am tired of cheap breakable water bottles that leak when I send them in my kids backpack for school.  This Klear Bottle is perfect.  It is compact and holds 18oz of water.  It is VERY durable with a seal tight lid and easy open mouth piece.

"Beautiful shoes!

I am really impressed with these shoes, especially the colors, they are beautiful!  I purchased the ""blue"" and they are a beautiful blend of colors.  The colors are very bold!  I love that with the mix of colors they can go with many different outfits.

They fit great!  I usually wear a 8 1/2 but these particular shoes do not come in half sizes so I took a chance with an 8 and they are actually a little loose but still very comfortable.

I emailed the merchant with a question before purchasing and received an immediate, friendly response.  The shoes arrived just as quickly!

I am very happy with this purchase!

"I am a freak about protecting my phones. I saw this case and thought it looked like a good deal but more importantly it looked like it would do a good job of protecting my new investment. Well I was right. It fit perfect and is made from a soft material that doesn't snag in my pocket. It is soft but super smooth. Also there is a hard plastic part that goes over the soft gel part. It also fits perfectly. The hard plastic seems very sturdy and should last a long time. It comes with a kick stand and a belt holder. I hate having the phone on my belt so I will never use that piece but it is also very sturdy and should last. All in all I feel this is a phone case that will 1, protect my phone 2, doesn't interfere with the ability to use my phone. 3, last probably as long as my phone. 4, not make my phone difficult to get out of my pocket. 5, not going to break the bank like other $50.00 cases.

"Im beyond happy and surprised with the quality and cut of this blazer. My biggest concern was that the fabric would be cheap or that the fit would be out of place, but I was pleasantly surprised. The design actually makes me look slimmer and the cut is amazing. I chose mine in the white color and it looks great, which is a plus considering that cheap fabric looks worse when it white. The fabric is thick enough to wear in the fall, but at the same time thin enough to wear it to work during the summer. I wear my tops in a size small and medium - I got this blazer in a medium and the fit is true to size. Its simply a great item and I seriously recommend purchasing with closed eyes  the quality is great, it is true to size, and the fit is fantastic.

"My husband is obsessed with these glasses. He has had his eyes on them for quite some time and finally I was able to get them for him. So first of all the glasses are actually really comfortable and the set up is quite easy. You download the app directly on your phone and place your phone in the virtual glasses. There's a few things to do on the app. We were discussing that definitely once there's more thing that can connect to them that it would make them that much more better. Otherwise we're really happy with these without breaking the bank. Definitely recommend them and make a great Father's Day gift.

"This review is for AMAZER BEST Digital Kitchen Timer, Digital Lound Timer with Large Screen Magnet for Kitchen Cooking Baking Sports Games Office, Includes 1 AAA Battery

Pros - Preferences - Item Info

Comes in own retail blister with instructions (poorly written)

Feels of weight, not cheap quality

Very large front display

Comes with one AAA battery

Has turn off switch on side which is a real bonus

Loud

Has magnet and stand ( although magnet isn't very strong)

Can be used as a timer , stopwatch style, etc

Easy large buttons - great for elderly

Cons - Preferences

As mentioned, the instructions are poor but one should be able to figure them out and the magnet could be strong.

Over all it is a nice kitchen timer and easy to use. I have two of this style and I greatly prefer this one simply because I can turn the battery power off when not needed.

"I have sprayed my lawn 3 times this summer. This product is weak and is a bit of a disappointment so far. My last mix earlier this week, I used about 1/2 of the bottle in 1/2 gallon of water to see if this would kill my dandelions by spot spraying. 3 days later now the weeds seem to have dried up a bit but I guess they will reappear in a few weeks as they did last two times. Would try something else with a stronger 24D additive next time.",0

"Well let's just say I had a few people see this and wanted to try it. This is a sturdy belt. It has good back support that helps stabilize your back when you have weights on. The support rests nicely on hips on the side and across your lower back. It was tugged and pulled a lot. The screw locking mechanism makes it were you can adjust the belt with the weights on to fit you properly and don't have to worry about it coming apart or slipping as soon as you start working out. The 30"" chain is long so it can hold larger plates and not get in the way. But remember the weight restriction and don't try to be He-man.

"Very nice beachwear, if you want to go to the beach feeling great then you should purchase this cute vintage cover-up. I got many compliments on it, I was even told it was so cute that I could wear it as a dress. I would highly recommend this to my friends and family. One thing to take into consideration w/this beachwear it's OS fits all. I have a very small body frame so it does feel a bit large for me ,these are the sizes as stated on Amazon, Chest width :39 inches, Clothes length 35.5-39 in so you may want to measure prior to ordering. I still like it even though it runs a bit large for myself, but its very comfortable and still super cute.

Case came in yesterday and its super easy to install. Pops right on and is nice and snug as well. Love the fact it has like a case within a case. So first is the silicone case which is really nice and soft and good for protecting from any scratching and drops. The outer case is a harder shell to go over the silicone. the case also have this neat kickstand feature so you can set it up while your watching a movie or videos. Then to top it off it has snaps into a holder that you can clip onto your belt or a purse or whatever you need too. Case is really sturdy and don't just pop off when tapped the wrong way. It has a finger holder that also works as a kick stand.  I love the belt clip which the phone can be put into the clip facing either direction.  Unfortunetly I did drop my phone which was not intentional but luckily it was while this case was on and not even as much as a speck of dirt got on my phone.  I really cant say enough how much I love this case.  I would definitely suggest this case if you are hard on your phone and would also make a great case for kids.

"The instructions on use is not clear. Managed to learn from other internet sources. The reflected laser beam is way out of focus and it is hard to understand whether the adjustment is right or wrong. It lights up the whole area while you should aim to have it in the center dot.

Battery life is fantastic!

I was really surprised how comfortable they were.
Once you have them positioned correctly, you hardly know you're wearing them as the comfort level is high. They stay in my ears without falling out and the buttons are easy to reach and use.
This is because they are very thin, and it almost feels like they don't exist.
The headphones come with an additional sets of earbuds in small, medium and large The earbuds are soft and comfortable.
This retractable earbud neckband is fairly light weight, folds up well and well constructed.
The ear buds extend out by pulling and retract by using a little button on each side. The controls are pretty simple to work and press too.switch to turn the device on so that it can start pairing with your phone

"These candles are rather lightweight and feel cheap, but they don't look it.  I was expecting something with a little more substance, but people probably aren't going to be picking these things up.

The flame is fairly bright, but the light it throws doesn't really resemble a true flame.  It pulses, which can be relaxing, but it's certainly a little slow for flame pattern.  It can set a mood and puts off good light to do so -- the 'fading' pattern isn't what I would consider the best flame simulation though -- it's a gradual on and off rather than a flicker that you'd expect.

I am about 5'5 and weigh about 140 pounds and this is just long enough to wear as a dress. If I was any taller or bigger it would be too small. However, if you are my size or bigger this would look great with skinny jeans or leggings. It is flowy and comfy and I know I will wear it constantly.

"I've used this fan for over a week now in my bedroom, and every night my husband says ""this is the coolest fan I've ever seen!"".
This fan has features that I didn't even know should be an option. It has a nature mode and a nighttime mode. Both of which alternate in either swing or speed. It makes falling asleep SO much faster. All of which make this 'the coolest fan ever!' to my husband. But there's different reasons as to why I love it so much.
1) The remote control. Who doesn't love being able to turn the fan up when you are in bed? Or turning it off in the middle of the night?
2) The heavy glass stand. I've had issues in the past with trying to prop fans up on dressers, or in a window and something always happens. This is a heavy glass stand that the fan fits into, which means it's safe from accidents, and safe from my kids messing with it.
3) Touchscreen controls. This almost makes it look as though it is a decoration opposed to a functional fan!
4) Super easy to put together, and clear instructions on how to use. Let's be honest, we've all gotten those instructions that don't make sense because they aren't in English. Not a problem with these. Also, the fan itself comes in 3 pieces. So you don't have to break out the screwdriver.

"This review is for The Coos iPhone 6s Screen Protector, iPhone 6 Screen Protector, [3D Touch Compatible Premium High Definition Shockproof] Clear Tempered Glass Curved Edge For iPhone 6S / 6 [3 PACK].

I recently was issued an iPhone 6 at work and was told that I would be responsible for any damage to the device. So I quickly started to look for tempered glass screen protectors. I have been installing them on all my phones and I have experience installing them with no bubbles and fitment issues.

Delivery: The item arrived on-time, but damaged in transit. I contacted Amazon and they had me re-order and then they refunded me the replacement costs. Thanks Amazon Customer Service.

The package comes with three protectors, wipes, dust removal stickers, cleaning cloth and an installation user guide. I am very familiar with the installation process of cleaning the phone, removing the dust, aligning the protector, double checking the alignment and finally setting the protector on the screen. Everything went smooth. It did not include a microfiber cloth for removing any bubbles on post-install cleaning  but I have many on-hand.

My only complaint and deal breaker is that it leaves the dreaded halo-effect around the perimeter of the protector. I have the iPhone 6 and do not know if this is not present on the iPhone 6s. I have included pictures of this defect. I call it a defect because since the iPhone glass is curved on the edges (as with other phones) the protector must be cut/made smaller to avoid this halo-effect.

Verdict: 3-Stars. It will definitely protect your iPhones screen from scratches. The problem is that it is too big for the iPhone 6 curved screen edge and it creates a halo-effect all the way around the perimeter of the protector/screen. If you don't mind that then this is a great value for 3 protectors for $8.99! I hope Amazon shoppers find this review helpful. Thank you for the opportunity to review these protectors.

How my Ratings Work:
1 Star = Awful. Complete junk. Do not buy. Stay far away.
2 Stars = Not good at all, but there are a few redeeming qualities...
3 Stars = It's okay. It's not terrible, but I'm not thrilled with it either.
4 Stars = Fantastic! I love it, but there are a few things that could improve.
5 Stars = This product is wonderful in every way. Buy it! Re-buy it! Worship it!!!

"JetNozzle - Brass Spray Nozzle.  These come in abox of two and are very heavy duty.  They twist onto a hose very easily and tighten down good with no leaking.

"I loved these! I used them in my kitchen to label all the bulk items we store in clear containers. They came with enough to do all my containers and more.

Pros:
They are easy to use and stick well. I have not had any come off.
The white chalk marker works really well and is comfortable to write with.
The stickers have a nice shape and are ascetically pleasing.
They wipe clean easy with a damp sponge or washcloth with no residue.
Once you stick the sticker it isn't coming of without some serious scrubbing or a solution to get it off.

Cons:
The pink chalk marker does not work well
Chalk Marker is kind of like a paint pen, it does take time to dry (honestly not that long though 6-10 seconds)

I usually wear a small and I ordered a size up to medium, but it was still too small.  Because it's so inexpensive, I gave the medium to my daughter and ordered another one in large.  I'm 5' 5"" , 125 pounds and the large was fine.  Be aware that it is rather clingy.  If you're self-conscious about a tummy or anything, it may not be for you.  I ended up shortening in to just above the knee too and it was easy to hem if you're in to tailoring clothes at all.",0
"These shorts are so very comfortable. I love the bright colors, which really helps out for running in the early mornings, or evenings. The waistband is pretty high, so if you are wanting a high wait coverage, these are perfect, they can also be folded over if you are not looking for that. I think that the inseam of these is longer than in the pictures, but the pictures from other Amazon reviewers looks much more accurate. Overall, this was a great purchase. They are good quality. They are light, but not so light that they are see- through like some other shorts.

"I bought this for my mom's phone and after the first day she dropped the phone and because of this it prevented my mom phone screen from cracking. This unit is very easy to apply no bubbles if you follow instruction, as always best place to apply this these is the bathroom. Run hot water for close the room for 10 mins and the steam will settled all the dust you can apply this without worrying about dust being on your screen afterward.

"Great!  I use it under my tempurpedic  pillow.  I can also use it laying on top of the pillow if I want to lay on my back.  it is loud enough to hear, but not loud enough for my husband to hear.  If you use the batteries with the booster you will be able to hear in the other room!  Great product!",0
"These are my first pair of Bluetooth earphones. They are comfortable, lightweight, and work well with my iPhone. There have been times where I have worn them for hours and they do not make my ears hurt. They stay in place while running and have good battery life. I have been using them on an almost every day basis for over a month. I do not have any complaints about them so far.

I did receive this product for free in an exchange for a review on my unbiased thoughts and opinions, but would not mind paying full price for them. They are my favorite pair of earphones. They make for a great gift for any athletes or gym people.",1
The description of the product says that its lightweight leather. It is definitely NOT leather and for that reason was a HUGE disappointment. I have ordered another case hoping that it will be leather this next time,0
"sweet, lightweight, cheap, washes easily and air dries really fast.",0
"Very well made, good engagement with chargers and devices, high quality. The ends are extruded and formed and not crimped, and the cable sheathing is very thick and securely fastened into the ends. Beware, this is not a thin cable nor is it very flexible. It is  very heavy duty, with the cloth wrapped cable almost 1/4"" thick and the flexibility limited as such. However, I have no fears of my kid ruining this cable.

EDIT: I have since ordered a second one of these cables because I'm impressed with the cable's ability to stay engaged in the phone and charger. This has been a problem for me with other cables, so if you're finding that happens to you this may be a solution.

"This package shipped quickly, and it arrived quickly as well. The packaging looks pretty spiffy, in that it has some terrific red and brown branding.

Opening the box was a treat. The inside reads just like a book, instructions and screen protectors on the left, and a refillable bottle of cleaner on the right. One thing that I would recommend is to *watch the video* that they provide. This is a stranger style screen protector, and you need a different method to apply it properly.

Overall a good screen protector for the price. For something so cheap I didn't expect so much packaging.

"After finally breaking my Otterbox that I've had for years, I needed a new rugged case. This probably isn't the best one out there, but it's quite nice, especially for the price.

"Dog, I am a fanny pouch fanatic so let me tell you this thing is spectacular. I travel a lot hints why I love fanny pouches. I recently when on a quick weekend vacation to Las Vegas so I figured what a better time to test out my new pouch. This pouch first of all  can fit the biggest of smart phones. I have an Iphone 6 and  it fits right in the pouch no problem along with my basic wallet contents as well. While on vacation my friend insisted we take a gondola ride to get some fresh air, unfortunately while entering the boat my pouch that I was carrying at the time fell into the water, but thanks to the reliable waterproof technology my Iphone 6 was not damaged in the least in fact the device and my identification and cash were all as dry as a bone.

"I really like this hat!  I ordered the pink one with the floral print inside and it looks just like the picture.  It fits well, although it is just a little tight, but I expect after some wear it will mold to my head perfectly.  The buttons are easy to button and unbutton and seem very secure.  I also really like how the brim is wired and poseable.

It definitely can catch some wind, but it did come with a matching adjustable pink strap that clips onto the smaller brim so it won't blow away or you can hang it on your back.

Overall I'm very happy with it.  I was fortunate to receive this hat at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and I'm glad I did :)",1
"This is such a cute collar!  We got the shooting stars and it is adorable!  It's lightweight and durable.  It is easily adjustable and has a plastic clip type buckle.  It is well constructed and all the ends are melted so they don't fray.  The tag-a-long is pretty neat but our tags won't fit on it.  The hole in it is pretty little, and very small wire ring could fit but ours was too big.

"There is a lot of perks to using this lunch bag. Just in case you don't know what Neoprene is (what the bag is made of ) like I didn't,  I want to Iet you to know that it is a synthetic rubber that uses a forming process with elastic materials. With that being known let me tell you the advantages of this bag.
water resistant- example this bag is made of the same material as a scuba diver's suit.
weather resistant -  no degradation if you sit it in sunlight. Won't cracked and peel on you.
Thermal and moisture insulation- keeping your cold foods cold and hot foods hot unlike using a plastic bag. I was surprised  that my food was still cold a few hrs later when I went to eat it. I'm use to my sandwiches  be room temp by the time I get to it.
stretchable- elastic and form fitting . I was able to place 3 small containers and a soda in my bag and still have a little bit more room.
Thickness and size- it is not bulky. You can lay it down flat and takes up almost no space at all to put up for next use.
 stylish- my 1yr old likes it so much  that she even try to you it as a purse. It's so light weight that she has no problems carrying  it around when with just a few things in it.

"I got this to assist me when I make cold brew coffee. the ability to see the measurements from the top instead of having to bend down to counter level to get the measurements right is so practical, I am surprised someone didn't make this sooner.

"This is a good set of lenses for cell phone photos. They come in a hard case that can be clipped into a bag or backpack for easy locating and to keep them clean. The clip on part of the lens attachment easily fits over the case I have on my phone.  The fish eye lens is separate from the other 2 lenses (macro and wide angle), which are screwed together in the case.  The macro lens is used by itself after unscrewing it from the wide angle lens, but the wide angle lens is used with the macro lens to work properly.

"Too small. Claims to be ""Great for storing utensils too large for drawers: spatulas, ladles, spoons, tongs, whisks and more suitable for storing and keeping your favorite cooking utensils accessible on the countertop."" You can see in the picture it's less than half the size of a large utensil. I don't consider my current  utensil holder to be small but it's much larger than this one, however it has been used hard and does need to be replaced which is why I purchased this one.  Unfortunately this one will be returned and I will continue to look. Please refer to the pictures for size.

"I ordered and quickly received the LG K10 Ballistic Screen Protector ShockWize  [Tempered Glass] .3mm Thin Premium Real Glass Screen Protector LG K10 [Lifetime Warranty] (1-Pack Clear).  Precisely laser-cut specially designed to accommodate all phone specs of the LG K10.

I loved how very simple and easy this screen protector was to put on. I have a lot of phones in my house and they all come to me to switch their cases or get protectors etc. Some of these screen protectors are a 10 step process with sprays and everything else but I figured its because the old peel and sticks just leave too many dang bubbles which are really annoying to look at. Surprise surprise, that is not the case. After I peeled off my daughter's other bubble ridden plastic mess, I cleaned it up and let it dry while I looked this one over.

"I was looking for an easy to use stand for my Samsung Galaxy Tab S2. I wanted something sturdy and stable, and with a small footprint and multiple viewing angles. I found everything I was looking for in this. It is very lightweight, but but designed so that when the tablet is sitting on it, but it is not tippy. I The bottom is coated in a nonskid materials that keeps it from shifting if jostled.

Because the arm that cradles the tablet is free moving, it gives you a very wide range of viewing angles. The groove that the tablet sits on is wide enough to accommodate a fairly thick case. Mine is in a case much thicker than an Otterbox and still fits nicely. I have also tried it with my Galaxy  S5 in an Otterbox case,  and my Kindle Fire 5 7"" in a book case, and they all fit perfectly.

It is also a nice looking and unobtrusive design, powder coated in matte black, it looks good without standing out. I have been using this for a week and would definitely recommend.

Yeah, at this stage in his life I like to outfit my kiddo with stuffs that is cute and soft. I'd give up the cuteness for something comfortable, but yeah, this fits both of our needs. Appears to be decently enough made (in line with the price at least), and since it really only has to last as long as he can wear it, well, I'm not too worried. I will, however, come back if this changes to let you know. Nice and soft, cute, yeah, I like it and I think my son does too.

This is great if you have a car and don't want to strap anything to the top of it. Inflates in 3-5 minutes. But they are light on the water which makes it hard to glide through the water if there is any wind ... makes a great raft to hold all the fishing gear.,0

"This little double sided mirror is PERFECT for a guest bedroom or guest bathroom, too! It's a great size for a dresser or on a bathroom sink. It's made from a high quality plastic and easily matches with any decor since it is a white plastic. This mirror is even small enough that you could travel with it, if needed. This is appropriate for anyone of any age!  Perfect size to get those eyebrows and eyeliner just right but not too big that it's taking up all of my space.

I bought these after my last pair bit the dust. I couldn't find the brand I had originally bought and wasn't too happy with those. So I looked on Amazon and found these. I've only worn them once but so far I love them. Much better fit than my last ones!,0
"What I like about them:
- They reduce eye strain. These sunglasses have 15% light transmission. To compare, Costa Del Mar 580 gray/silver mirror/copper/amber lenses have 12% light transmission. While these are not designed specifically for fishing (not a high enough VLT), they will do the trick (I should note, you will get a very slight reflected glare on these when fishing open water.)
- They're lightweight. These sunglasses weigh 1 oz (0.99 oz to be exact.)
- The nose piece is rubber, making these more comfortable than all plastic sunglasses.
- They stay in place. With the nose piece and ear pieces being rubber, these sunglasses stay in place when I lean down. You can also tighten the arms by tightening the frame screws.
- They wrap around your face nicely giving you better peripheral vision as well as decent protection from wind.
- They're polarized. This is a must for fishing.
- They come with a hard case and a soft case. Given my toddler already destroyed a nice pair of sunglasses, I place these in the hard case when they're not on my face.
- The nose piece can be quickly replaced. The rubber nose piece isn't glued on but rather held on by two screws. Should you damage the nose piece, you can easily replace it.
- They come with a lifetime warranty on the frame and lenses. Given both the frame and lenses are plastic, normal use in the sun will eventually degrade the plastic causing failure. I like knowing that if/when this occurs, I can return them for a new pair. In my opinion, the warranty is what makes them worth the price.

What I don't like about them:
- Without croakies, these glasses get uncomfortable really quick. I've always put croakies on my sunglasses for fear of them falling in the water when I'm fishing. My croakies are the kind that go over the ear pieces so they add comfort to the glasses. But, if you intend to wear these without croakies, you may find them becoming uncomfortable after 30 minutes of wear.

Overall, I am very happy with these sunglasses and would recommend them for anyone needing a good pair of sunglasses for outdoor activities. If you're needing a great pair to get you through the loss of a nice pair of Costas or Oakleys, until you can afford a new pair, then look no further!

I received this product at a discount to evaluate and review. I shop almost exclusively at Amazon, due to convenience, and I rely heavily upon product reviews, just like you. I will always review a product with honesty based on the quality of the product, regardless of whether I received a discount. If it's a crap product, I will say so. If it's a good product, I will say so. If you feel the product isn't worth the cost, then try to find something comparable that's in your price range. Or, look to see if you're offered a satisfaction guarantee, which will allow you to return it for a full refund should it not meet your expectations. Too many ""unbiased reviewers"" have ruined this system. I won't be part of that statistic even if it means I'm not selected for future evaluations.",1
"Overall I am pleased with this mount. I needed to change the current magnetic ball mount for one that did not have the magnet on my phone as I was having problems carrying my phone and credit cards together in the same pocket without the card strip being erased. I like the color of the rose gold and the magnetic disc. It stays in place very well on the metal ball as well as not slipping from the metal disc attached to my phone. The only concern I have is the sticker on the front of the disc is peeling off, also the disc separates sometimes when removing my phone. Minor but slightly annoying issues.

"I love this purse! It just gives off a very classy vibe. I purchased the orange one with the beautiful contrasting beige handle. According to some reviewers they have reported the bag for having a strong smell coming from it when unwrapped from its packaging however, for me there wasn't any strong stench when I took the purse out of its packaging. To me the inside of the bag is very spacious with lots of room. I can even fit my metal water bottle along with a small umbrella. However, I do wish that the center space/pocket was attached to the bottom so that there would be a definite separation of items from the left and right. It would be more convenient if the items on the left side of the bag didn't end up on the right side. It does not come with a shoulder strap so that might be a bit inconvenient if you're used to long handle/strap bags. Since this bag isn't meant to be worn that way. For this bag Im usually a bit more careful with what I put in it because I have to carry it on my arms and not my shoulders just so it doesnt get too heavy. Overall, I love the color combo and design of this bag since it gives off a classy but yet youthful vibe. I received this bag at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.",1
I recently purchased a bike and attended a new bike owners clinic.  It was recommended that we purchase a multi-tool kit to make any adjustments needed on our bike and to carry with us in a small pack under our bike seats.  There are many cycling tool kits on the market.  This one was less expensive but had mostly the same features as a brand the bike store carried. The pictures that are next to the product description are accurate and clearly show what items are in this multi-tool kit.  I like that this tool kit is very lightweight and easy to carry. Its about 3 in length and about 1  wide when folded together and all the pieces are made out of solid metal.  The various tools smoothly flip out and they are easy to fold back to the original shape of the kit.  The 11-in-1 functions are all that I need at this point.  Im pleased with this purchase. I received this multi-tool cycling kit at a discount for my honest opinion.  I hope youve found this review helpful.,1
"I have a huge fan of screen protectors and since I recently put a screen protector on my phone and love it. I am on a mission to protect all my family members phones with protectors. I received this screen screen protector for work phone that I recently received. I have not used this before and have been impressed.

First thing this kit comes with everything you need to prepare you phone before you apply your screen protector. The instructions are simple and I understand them. I prepped my phone with the items the provided. The screen protector in my opinion is sturdy in my opinion. It was simple to apply I had no problems with it. Now I feel more comfortable that I have the screen protector protecting my phone.

"The Zacro wireless bike speedometer is a great addition to my 16 year olds bike.  It installed easily and isn't a distraction on his handlebar at all.  It recorded his speed with relative accuracy and kept track of the total distance as well as his riding time.  It also showed his maximum speeds as well as his average speed.  There is a 12 or 24 hour clock depending on what setting you use.  You can also set it for Miles or Kilometers.  He found it easy to set up.  He is currently using it on a mountain bike / street bike hybrid.

It is wireless and the sensors attach to the front fork of the bike spokes.  The display is also back lit for night riding in either green or white. A bonus compass key ring is also included.  It wakes with movement of the bike which is a great plus and it also shuts off when no use is detected after a period of time.  So far he has liked using this and hasn't reported any problems with it.

I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  So far so good and he looks forward to using this during his next long bike ride.",1
"I wanted the insulated bottle because my daughter had one that worked well.  I live in Texas and it is HOT, HOT, HOT right now.  I spend a lot of time in my vehicle and have been carrying a lunck bag with ice pack and water to keep it cool enough in this Texas heat.  THis is an awesome bottle.  I always wash stuff before I use it so I boiled some water and filled the bottle - heck why not test the 12hr hot keeper while washing it for use.  The first thing I notice was the cap for the bottle stayed warm indicating that the contents were hot; next thing was the bottle itself was cool to the touch - making it easy to hold.  Stayed hot for the 12 hrs and remained warm for some time after that.  Next the cold test.  It worked well - again the cap stayed cold allowing me to remember the contents of the bottle were cold.  The next time I added a few ice cubes (the ice maker size) fits perfect in the top of the bottle.  Made the tap water colder and kept it colder longer.  The bottle kept the water cold even in the heat of the car.  No drinking warm water.  I really like this vacuum insulated bottle and will add it to my Christmas gift list this year.

"These sunglasses remind me of the mullet. Business in the front, party in the back. Only, instead of the back, the party is on the sides. I love that they look basic and then SURPRISE! Flowers on the sides. And really cute flowers, not an ugly print at all. These are really fun! They seem to protect my eyes really well and fit comfortable. They also don't feel like they will fall apart like most inexpensive pairs do. I would say they are a really good value if you like cute glasses that are also functional and won't break easily. I have a toddler so breakage is a real threat around here. I cant tell you how many pairs of sunglasses he has abused to their untimely death. Its nice to know I can get a cute replacement without breaking the bank!

"I would highly recommend this Apple watch screen protector to anyone who is interested in buying and preventing any scratches or damages to their Apple watch. If you own an Apple watch you know how pricey they are. If you are paying that amount of money it is important you take care of your watch as much as possible. This skinomi screen protector is a necessity for preventing any screen damage.
The screen protector itself is a smooth matte finish which I personally favor over others. This comes in a 6 pack which is nice because you are applying these yourself and it can be tricky to get the screen protector on just right. If you mess up once, you have 5 others to work with. If one gets damaged in any way, you still have extras. For the price this is a perfect buy. I highly recommend this brand and this specific product to interested buyers.

Disclosure: I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate in order to test and give an unbiased review. As a longtime customer of Amazon, I also depend on honest reviews for purchases. A discounted rate of a product will not have influence over my personal opinion as i am extremely knit picky and rip everything apart. I promise to update my reviews if anything regarding my impression changes.",1
"I ordered these because I am determined to not buy lunch every day at work. Meal prep is important to me because I am lazy at heart. Thinking of what to take for lunch is something I would rather not do everyday, so I do it once a week. The only problem is that I have no Tupperware that matches. These containers changed the game entirely.  The Meal Prep Sundays containers are 32 ounces and have three compartments. I have a total of 8 lids and 8 plates. I never have to worry about someone taking my containers anymore. I use these when I meal prep (on Sundays lol) for the work week. They stack nicely in my fridge. A plus is that they're microwave safe, which is wonderful. Make sure you tip the lid off though, or it gets really hot. These are easy to clean. They don't feel very durable though. Also, they're bigger than I expected. They don't exactly fit in my lunchbox, but I will make it work somehow. Overall, these are wonderful. Just make sure you know what size you want and what will work best for you.

"I was looking for an exceptionally durable screen protector for my new device, and after careful consideration and comparison, I decided to purchase IQShield Screen Protector. I am not going to lie - I was a bit concerned about the installation process after reading the reviews but still decided to give it a try.

When Ive received the IQShield screen protector, it came with a microfiber cloth, squeegee, water spray, set of installation instructions and the IQShield Lifetime Warranty. I read the instructions first and find them very simple, easy-to -follow and clear but lacking the confidence to do it right (my first wet install) I decided to watch the YouTube video guide on their website.

IQShield screen protector is a wet install type of film so you have to use the included spray for installation. Initially, I freak out. I find it odd to put some sort of liquid on an expensive device. Nevertheless, I followed through the video and has come to realize that its actually a lot better than the ones Ive tried in the past, the stick and peel kind of film that once you get to place the sticky stuff, it just stuck on there permanently and if you screwed it, then thats the end of it.

On the contrary, with the wet install application, I can have several trials, minor repositioning and adjustments while the film is wet until Im fully satisfied with the outcome, which is really great and a welcome change.

Anyhow, I prepped the film and installed it according to instructions. I was a bit worried when Ive finished and had excess fluids and bubbles. The screen was not crystal clear. It appeared somewhat pixelated and has micro bubbles most likely because of the moisture thats left underneath the screen protector. I kept on squeegeeing until most of them were gone. After a few days, the screen is already clear and translucent as if it wasn't there. It is also noteworthy that this film does not mess with the clarity and look of your pictures nor does it cause touch/tactile sensitivity issues and more remarkably, it is very compatible with the secondary case I have that when you put the CASE on, you cant even tell that its there.

Overall, Im super satisfied with my purchase.

These goggles are absolutely amazing! They have an awesome clasp in the back for putting them on easier and so there is no snagging of hair! They work great underwater it's true when they say fog proof my son and u traded on and off for 2 hours in the pool and I never had to take them off for fogging reasons! I think these are great and will be buying another pair! I really hope that this review is helpful to you!",1

"I bought these socks for my son, who is a defensive end for his football team. He currently practices in the hot sun, 5 days a week, conditioning for the start of his season. He has put holes in most of the socks he owns, because he sweats a lot, plays hard, and ""digs in"" when he blocks his opponents. Socks are very important to his position!

I struggle with buying specifically-football socks for my son, because they are so expensive, and you never know if they're going to be worth the money. Most of the socks he wears to practices are regular sports socks. But there is something to be said for the support that true football socks offer.

My son tells me that these socks are very comfortable, and they fit him well. They are absorbent, and don't allow blisters to form while he runs hard and plays ball. They are snug over his calves, not too tight, and didn't slip or fall at all. He does have strong, muscular legs, so they may be more snug on him than others, but I still think they would stay up on someone with thinner calves.

The blue is bright and beautiful! We shall see how well the color holds up, after being washed twice a week all season.

I highly recommend these socks for football players!

I especially like it's it's Quiet!!  I have clocks that drive me crazy... This will be replacing one of those! I love the heart on the second hand and the way that it sweeps!

***Disclosure... I shop extensively on Amazon and have done so since it was founded on July 5th 1994. That's about 22 years. (My husband also shops on Amazon and he buys more than I do!! All of his purchases are from Amazon's normal price... I also buy many things we need at the normal everyday price.) Amazon Prime is Amazing and everyone should have it!!

I rely heavily on reviews and many times don't purchase items with bad reviews!! I know about a year or so ago... We all started to see many reviews that stated... they purchased the item at a discount for their honest review.  I shop online for all 5 of our children and their spouses and  19 Amazing grandchildren.  I'm only 58..how did that happen??  =)
I was actually feeling angry many times thinking... How can I believe their reviews if they received it at a discount??!!??  Sometimes I would only see reviews from those receiving a discount and not want to purchase it as I didn't feel they were being honest back then. What I didn't know is that it was usually a new seller trying to start their businesses.

Let me tell you,  that since I've been reviewing a few products for a discount lately... I have come to realize that these new or smaller sellers have some really great products!!  What they need are some honest reviews to make sure you'll give them a chance.  I think if you'll look around at the reviews while you're shopping... most of those reviews are truly honest.  A High percentage of these reviewers leave a good and descriptive review and even post photos as I sometimes do... these usually always reflect my own experience!!  I've seen this because... If the product doesn't meet the sellers claims or description or it is of a very low quality in my own honest opinion and the product was horrible....before I leave my review... I try read other reviewers comments and have noticed that most are leaving the same low star reviews as I was and also letting others know that the product wasn't sturdy or was made of thin plastic etc.
I even return the product if it's defective or low quality as I'm paying my own money to purchase these products. ( I have a box taped up and ready to return as it wasn't great in my opinion.  I also  state in my review...If I'll be returning a product if it's not worth the price or is deceptive in its description)  So as a Amazon shopper for many many years... I hear you loud and clear!!  Please give these sellers with great products a chance to earn your trust and business!!
** I  (as you know... if you hung in there and read down to this! )  received this at a discount or free for my honest and unbiased opinion!!  I don't receive any money or Incentives to leave a 5 star review.  If my review is low it's because in my opinion it's not worth the price or I'll let you know why it didn't meet or exceed my expectations. If it does I'll let you know! Sorry that was so long but I wanted you to understand how this works.  If my reviews are helpful in your decision on these products please **CLICK HELPFUL** below!  I love helping others by leaving my reviews and would love your feedback!

"I had a car vent phone holder very similar to this in the past, same design, that end up breaking.  I bought this phone holder and it works great.  I use this to hold my GPS in place.  I do not get any movement when going over bumps or around turns.  This design of a clamp that you can tighten down on the vane on the air vent works much better than the other design by other manufacturers which have the four slots and you place the slots over the vane in the vent.  The other style I have owned and thrown away since they do not securely hold onto the vane.  I am very pleased with this car vent phone/gps holder.

"These are great pillowcases for the price! Definitely worth the money. I would not call them ""Sateen"" by any means, but for the price, I could not justify complaining.

They only put zippers on pillow protectors, not pillowcases. These are far better than what I found in stores for three times the price. Thank you, Rajlinen!",0

"Is it possible to be in love with a speaker? I think I might be in love with this speaker! When you are dealing with speakers this small you run the risk of getting tinny audio and fortunately that is not the case with this speaker.

I purchased this for my shower, but I ended up getting another so that i can take it on bicycle rides. This speaker doesn't really disappoint. There is an option to use a micro sd slot, but I'm content using bluetooth. If you are in the market for one of these, do yourself a favor and get this.

"I bought this so that I could quickly charge my iPhone on the way to work. There are many different charges that all seem to charge at different speeds and I was looking for the one to do the job the fastest way possible. I believe that this charger did its job perfectly fine and was just what I was looking for! The best part is that the Apple lightning cable is already built in, therefor I do not have to take the one from my room to my car every time. In less than 10 minutes I was able to get 10% charge back! The built in cable is super-fast! I took some screenshots of the charger current and compared it to what is it like using the original power brick included with the iPhone, the results show that the current is twice as much, meaning its the same as if you were using the bigger power brick included with the iPads. Unfortunately, if you are to use the USB slot and charge something with it, it has only half the current, so charging here will take a bit longer than the built in lightning cable. The build quality of it is pretty alright, nothing amazing here, but chances are you won't be feeling the plastic around it just move the cable around in the car. I am giving it 4 stars because the build quality is a bit too low for the price of the product, but at the same time it does an amazing job rapidly changing your phone.  I received this charger to review at a discount but I have written a completely unbiased review on it.",1

Hello There!

I bought this supplement because I have a 7,almost 8 year old Akita.
I have been noticing for about a month now, that he is slower getting up after laying down for a while.

I also know that larger breed dogs develop stiff joints, especially in their hind quarters and arthritis.

This had me concerned for him.

It has only been 2 days, but I have squirted this formula on his food both days.
We will see what happens.

Now, the best part is he is a very picky eater,almost like a cat.
If he doesn't like the smell or taste, he will NOT even attempt to at it.

Well, he loves this and ha no reservations about eating it.
What a relief!

It DOES smell like beef!

I will update as time goes on to let you know if I notice an improvement in his discomfort.

Thanks for making this tasty for my boy!",1

"The protector works, I like it. I was able to get it on with minimal bubbles. However, it peals up at the edges where the case hits it. My case doesn't cover the screen and this shouldn't happen, but I can't seem to avoid it. It's definitely frustrating. I'll have to change it soon.",0
I wasn't sure on this product but I have been looking at these to try on my mini dashchund. So day 1 I put on the collar and the smell is VERY strong it's not a horrible smell but it's strong. After a few days the smell fades and I don't notice it anymore. I also haven't seen my dog scratching or any fleas on her. So it's working. Which was the total reason of the product. I did receive this product for free or discounted for my own unbiased opinion all statements are 100 % my own.,1
"The mini dessert cups are so cute and are great for a party. They hold a 2oz capacity and are perfect for individual desserts or as little cups to hold candy, nuts or appetizers. I love the cups! They are great to serve at parties because they are perfect size for individual servings. I prefer to use these cups for appetizers and desserts instead of making a bowl for a whole party to share. These bowls are a great alternative; its more sanitary this way. I have used them by placing salsa; guacamole and ranch dip in them. I put them on a nice looking tray so that guests could choose their own cup to dip their chips and veggies in without any concern about sharing germs with others. There are 50 cups in the pack, which is a prefect amount for any dinner gathering or party. The cups are fancy looking; they aren't plain round cups. The shape adds elegance to the cups so they look high quality. The quality is pretty decent considering they're disposable cups which also is a plus because there is no need to wash them afterward. The cups that I received are all in good condition. I wasn't sure if some of them would be cracked or chipped but after opening the package and evaluating each one they were all in perfect condition. I like the idea of individual servings and recommend the cups for the convenience and sanitary reasons. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",1

"Its a great bed and a very comfortable sleep. It is very simple to set up but it is a little heavy to maneuver alone, I did it alone, but I recommend having two people to help you carry the box and help set up the mattress. The bed is very comfortable but could even be softer and more squishy for my taste, however I prefer a bed that body can sink down a little bit more when I lay on it; however, this is one comfy mattress and a good night sleep. It's a good combination with the Zinus bed platform for $99. I purchased it and I'm very pleased as well and goes great with the bed. Overall the mattress is very comfy and a bargain for what you get.",0
These are fairly reasonably priced. But I had a horrible time getting them out of the sleeve. Warmed it up as suggested but it's not cold out anyway. I threw two away because they both ripped before I could untwist them. Will not purchase again. Last ones I had were Tat. They worked much better,0

"I really do love  these little lights ! The fact that they resemble a regular light switch is awesome making it second nature to just flip the switch and let there be light ! Do not let the size of these lights fool you they may only be a little over 3"" wide by 4.5"" high (just slightly larger than an average size light switch plate) but they put out a lot of light. I was truly impressed the first time I turned it on, I guess that is why it requires the 3 AAA batteries that are included with both lights. These lights are great anywhere light is desired and hard wiring is not. I put the first one in our home safe which is now no longer a dark hole of ""what the heck is in here"".I put the second one in our gun safe, because lets face it that is a good place to be able to see and get what you need when you need it, and neither one of these places gave me the option of easily adding a light. All I had to do was peel off the self adhesive backing and stick it on and one minute later good to go. Now as far as the batteries are concerned, the ones that came with them have held up quite well but honestly the two safes are really not a high traffic area so I do not know how well they will stand up in a closet or cabinet that is used more frequently but I am planning to replace the ones that are in them now with rechargeable's when it becomes necessary. I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, but no matter the reason I acquired them I am very glad I have had the opportunity to experience just how handy and versatile they are. So yes if you have a dark hole somewhere in your home, office, garage, basement , or wherever you will have a use for this product. Thank You for taking the time to read this review, I hope I was able to ""shed some light"" on any questions you may have had.",1

"I am an animal lover! Always have been and always will be. After seeing this product to review, I knew right away that I needed to try it out. I already have a brush that has the wire bristles that my 16 year old cat likes but my dachshund and my pug did not really enjoy the wire brush. When I got approved to review the brush and saw that it had a coating on the end of the bristles I purchased it right away.
  After receiving the product, I opened it up and the packaging was appropriate for the product, it was very easy to open. I work in a large mega franchise retail setting and if this were to get to the retail side, the product would be easy for people to steal. My suggestion to the seller is to make the packaging with the plastic, hard to open, sealed, hard case. Also, I noticed the glove part is very large. I have a size small/medium hands and a small wrist, I felt like when I had the glove on I had to spread my fingers out to keep the brush from slipping off my hand. The soft part of the Velcro on the wrist, I believe, should go all the way around the glove. As far as the breathable material and the brushes, it is a very great idea. I just thing there are a few things that could improve the glove for me to purchase this for my other friends that are animal lovers. First: the breathable material would be nice if it had more elastic to fit anyone's hands (""one size fits all""), and maybe cut out a more defined thumb area. The brushes could possibly be tweaked by shortening the main brush at the top about maybe 5 or 6 rows and making the thumb brush thinner to get in the smaller areas of the pets like their faces and chins (sensitive areas). Other than that, the brush is a wonder product that need a little more TLC.
  As far as what my pets think of this brush, my cat saw it and quickly ran over to me. She couldn't get enough! She loves the wire brush, but I don't like using it on her because of her age and she's so fragile; while I brushed her she started drooling and I had to hide it from her so my dogs could get a turn at it! My dachshund enjoyed the brush, but my pug is still a baby and she would only let me brush her once or twice before she would run away. I'm sure that when she's tuckered out, she would be more susceptible to the brush.

"I wear a size 6/5 or 7 shoe and these ""low profile"" sock liners fit me very well. I wore them with ballet flats, and they did not show! I detest wearing shoes without socks because I always end up getting blisters, no matter what shoes I wear. This style offers enough protection for my skin and the elastic ""closure"" that keeps them in place did not cause any discomfort. There is a slight extra thickness at the toe and heel, and there is a touch of something in the weave at the back to keep them from slipping down as you walk. There obviously was attention to detail in the making of these liners. Don't confuse them with the cheap ""peds"" that you can pick up at the dollar store. This is a much higher quality product. I did receive a sample for review, and I am very impressed by these little liners. Because I really detest going sockless, these little liners are the perfect solution for comfort and freshness. Totally recommended.",1

We love this power bank and enjoyed using it on our Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, we saw the same fast charge speed as we have become used to with our S7 Edge stock charger. You get 1 Quick Charge 2.0 USB output and a second USB output at a nice 5v/2.1A, all in a lightweight package for a decent price.  The outer aluminum shell is a one piece shell that looks and feels fantastic!

Pros

Quick Charge 2.0 for Output
Nice large 10200mah capacity.
Unit is not heavy.
Dual USB Outputs for multiple devices

Cons
Only thing I found that I  could ""call"" a con was that it does NOT have Quick Charge 3.0 Output, only input.  But not enough for me to deduct a star

Overall this is a great deal from iKits, 2 thumbs up!

"So I really wanted a fit bit but not at the outrageous price. So this was my next option. Thankfully I was approved and had the option to try this product at a discounted rate I've had it for a week or so and there are a few things I like about it and a couple of things that I do not. With the app, I have the option to set reminders to get up and move around and track my history. I basically see this as a pedometer that is worn. It tracks steps, tells time, tells me how many calories I have burned ""supposedly"" I feel like there should be more depth into the stride and maybe tracking bmi. I don't feel like it could accurately count steps or count burned calories without those two options. So far it has been pretty accurate on the steps though. The first day, I kept the watch on and my phone in my pocket with only minor differences. But the calories burned, I don't know how accurate that can be without the bmi. I am not saying it isn't correct, but idk. It's pretty easy to charge. It holds a charge well. I was able to wear it constantly for 4 days before the battery was too low. I really don't care for the calling or message feature. I have to swipe it after answering a call or it does not stop vibrating. It's basically just a notification. It does have a sleep timer but it is so sensitive that if I bump my body in my sleep it still lights up. Even with the sleep setting on. It does not monitor the heart rate. Like I said before, this is kind of a fancy, wearing pedometer that tells you who calls or texts you and what time it is. It has however prompted me to be more active and I like that I don't have to worry about having a pedometer clipped on my clothes. I received this at a little under half of the original cost and I can honestly say that I am not too disappointed. Even if I paid full price, i would still be juat as happy with this watch. Simply because it does make me feel a little more motivated and most people I talked to asked me what it was and they thought it was pretty neat. I can live without the heart rate function and I'm content with this. I don't see myself switching to something else or running to buy a fit bit any time soon. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. I think the features I do not like, might just take some getting used to.

"I have to admit that I didn't read all about this product because I really needed the bread scraper (flat sided one) so I just clicked it.  I thought it was plastic which I was ok with even though I wanted a metal one.  WELL, wasn't I surprised and excited to find out that this was metal and what I was wanting all along.  You will need to wash this good and the metal scrapper had a film of oil on it.  It is a mechanical oil, I have smelled it before in a work shop so make sure to really wash it good and rub it.  The bowl scrapper is rubber over (I think) the same metal and I am a little disappointed that it doesn't bend.  Just the edge bends which is ok, but was hoping that it was more flexible but this will do. I received this product at a discount for my honest review that is my own feeling on this product and may or may-not be the same as yours. I will only leave an honest review no matter if I receive a discount or not. I will update my reviews to add or subtract stars if the product changes during use. I would still buy this again !  The way that I review varies with each item.  Some have so many great things that it is easy to go on and on about all of the positive things.  Others only have enough to state that they are bad.  If a review is too long people stop reading it so what is the point.  My Stars also depend on how I I like/dislike the product on my own personal level. I may also list a product as 3 stars even though I didn't like it as it may be a good product in itself for someone else.  Just because it didn't work exactly the way I wanted it to doesn't mean that it is a bad product all around.  I hope that makes sense.

"I LOVE this case. I really hate having a case on my phone, but lets face it, life is tough. I like the look of my phone but cases are always covering that up! I had a similar case on my s6 and I love it. I also love this case. It provides protection but allows you to see what your phone actually looks like because it is clear. I received this phone for free and I think it is a great product!",1
"These shoes are super sweet! Very well put together and soft! I love the little ribbon. It holds them on her feet very well! These even have little grip pads on the bottom to help little walkers. They are a little thick but she is getting used to them. I'm sure she will wear these until they ware out!

I did receive these at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review!",1
"Very nice 3 piece knife set... Each of the knifes are very sharp and easy to use.  The Set includes 6 pieces, three knifes and three protective covers (shafts). Each knife has a nice design on them and are made of bright colors. These knives are fun and easy to use right out of the package.  I was able to cut everything (fruits, veggies, meat)  with ease.  I get so tired of having dull knifes... Looking for sharp knifes look no more!

"GREAT silicone watch band for the Fitbit Alta by Bayite!  There are a few things that I look at when purchasing off brands and this is what I found:

- Clasp works great and doesn't pop out, allowing the Fitbit to fall off your wrist
- Each piece clips onto the Fitbit center tracker well and doesn't wobble around
- The size is VERY comparable to the original Fitbit bands, just a bit shorter, but not noticeable until you lay them side by side
- Color is bright and vibrant
- Feels just like the original: soft, flexible and easy to clean with a damp cloth
- I really like the textured band, as it looks like an original Fitbit band - except in a different and fun color

I would absolutely purchase more in different colors, so I have a bunch to match different outfits.  It comes with a clear/transparent silicone fastener, which is great - although it's just a bit too small and is difficult to move back and forth when you need to remove your Fitbit. This obviously isn't a big issue, as the clasp works great on its own and you can remove it easily.  Overall, I'm super pleased with this replacement band and the price is EXCEPTIONAL compared to purchasing a brand name band!  DEFINITELY recommended!!!

"This dress is absolutely amazing for those looking for a cool retro 1950's vibe, or swing dress, rockabilly style.  I was lucky enough to receive the black and white polka dot and it is so adorable.  It is cap sleeve, which allows it to be cool enough for summer and the skirt is a little past the knee and modest and allows some swing and flair.  I added a petticoat underneath for even more style and am in love!  It is a cotton/spandex blend made with well made lightweight stretch fabric that allows for a slimming affect and like i said it is great for summer because of the breathable and lightweight material.  It is not see through underneath, so no lip is needed.  It has a zipper closure, a v-neck collared cap sleeve with unlined and side zipper closure, and like I said hits above the knee so allows a good leg line.  It comes in classic and iconic vintage solid colors but I preferred the polka dot and felt it really added to the 1950s vintage swing vibe.  It has buttons and a cute removable matching belt, but you could also use a different belt if you wanted to add a pop of color.  It seems very suitable for casual wear for those who are funky, for a fun date, appropriate for work, a wedding, party, dancing , clubwear, night time going out, cocktail parties, banquets and balls, or even prom!  Just make sure to check the size chart.  It does have special washing instructions and advises to either hand wash or use low temperature for washing and ironing and to line dry but that is the only drawback.  All in all, it is an awesome and fun, funky dress for all body types!  I received the dress at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",1

"Great kettle. Works very efficiently and quietly. Does NOT have an audible beep when finished as another reviewer suggested, which was disappointing. Almost no plastic comes into contact with the water if you remove the filter. It was a little different to get used to at first because we used a stovetop kettle before and this is clunkier. The water really flows when you pour, so I kept missing my cup. But after a day or two I adjusted and it has been great. Love the small footprint too! Seems durable so I am hopeful it will last a long time.",0
"I have tried many pencil sharpeners for my kids but so far this is the best one. The best feature that I liked was the adjustable switch for the thickness of pencil point. In the past whatever sharpeners I have used , made the pencil points really thin because of which it used to break really easily. This sharpener greatly helped me with that problem.
  It takes just a couple of seconds to sharpen the pencil with this sharpener and it has the auto stop option. The removable transparent cover makes it easy to clean. It has a very compact design and it runs on battery as well as an adapter which makes it very portable.
  I used this sharpener for different pencil types and it worked well for all. You can look at the picture that I have attached. The kids enjoyed using this sharpener too.

"Anyone who remembers the 80s and earlier remembers these little vegetable choppers. The one I had back then had a plunger. A few weeks ago I was actually saying I missed my chopper. I forget what I was chopping up but I just didn't feel like doing it. So when I had the opportunity to review this I jumped at the chance.

Description:

Basically except for the blades, which I am assuming are stainless steel, it is a plastic device. I mentioned the plunger in previous paragraph because I didn't pay attention at all to the sellers description (I was so excited to see a chopper) and when I opened it I was a bit surprised not to see one. I was wondering how I was supposed to work it but then I saw this pull string, you know sort of like the old Speak-N-Say toys (Im pretty sure Im seriously dating myself with all these references).  Apparently the top comes in three different colours, pink, lime green, darn I cannot remember the other colour and Ive already tossed the box.

Use:

I have to admit that due to the fact that it was pull string I was worried that it actually wouldnt be strong enough to chop anything. I was surprised that it did indeed work. Now obviously one must chop the veggie first; so don't go tossing out your knife set. But for the onions I chopped into rough  of an inch hunks and tossed them in and pulled away. Took about 8 pulls to get the diced size on I wanted. Just like in the olden days there is always one or two slivers that don't chop and you have to take them out set aside and put back in with next round or finish by hand. Honestly not a big deal. I mean its not like this is an electric chopper for pitys sake.

A plus to the pull string is that if I hold the base my 3 year old was able to pull the string and the chopper still worked. That is HUGE in my house as he loves to help me in the kitchen and gets incredibly upset with me because I won't let him use the knife. So this thing is worth the money just for that.

And one more word about the size of the chopping. If you pull the string 10 to 15 times it minces the onion so fine that it is perfect for making homemade barbeque sauce, did the same for the gloves of garlic as well. So now we don't have hunky bbq sauce, clearly we don't have great knife skills in my house.

I cannot remember if it is dishwasher safe or not, but I tossed it in the top rack of my dishwasher and no damage. I love it.

"I had been looking for a product that has a charging feature, self-power generating feature,  NOAA, AM/FM, and many other functions in a portable radio. Since I already own one this was perfect for my father, since his birthday is coming up. He loves my little radio so this would be the perfect gift. I actually could resist trying this radio out, so to ensure it worked I've been using it, since it has better features than the one that I currently own.

"This Camera is Sweeeeet! I tried to capture the moon as advertised on QVC and I must say I got clearer and more impressive close up shot than with my expensive DSLR without using a tripod. Talk about being impressed! Even the folks I show it to can hardly believe it even when they're right next to me when I'm taking the shot. Read the manual. Lots of great info that you will miss if you don't. This camera is packed with good stuff. The most important part for me is that I'm able to soot in Manual mode. Since learning the importance of shooting in this mode I understand that I'm shooting for what I want rather than what the camera wants to give me (Auto mode). This camera allows me to do that or semi manual or auto. I love this camera. It's a clear winner. The only thing missing is a hot shoe for external flash. Other than that; I say, you can't go wrong with this one.",0

"This is a really well made wallet case. It has a strong magnetic hold, has several credit card slots. A big plus is a separated area under the credit cards where you can slide in dollar bills. This wallet case has lots of room for all your credit and gift cards. The case did come very well package in a small gift box or card board  box to keep it in. It was also in a in a little bag to keep it from scratches, the sellers did think of everything you may need with this case.
I did get the brown cell phone case and the color is beautiful and very rich in color. The magnetic closure it very strong and stays put. This case is made of high quality material and is well stitched together. Think this is one of the best cases I have gotten so far. Another great feature of the cell phone case is that the area around your camera lens is cut out more that some cases, which allows you to be able to focus on more of the area you are trying to capture in your photo.
Your phone is very well protected with this case. Wonderful idea! This is the perfect cell phone case for someone who doesn't like carrying a purse or bag and you still have a place to carry all your important items as cash and or credit cards. This case is very well made and it is a very nice looking and convenient cell phone wallet case.

"I got this for a friend who is getting married soon!

Good news is, she loves it. It's the kind of veil she was looking for to match her dress. Bad news is that it's ivory and her dress is white. :(

Overall, the veil is really good quality. It's got tons of sequins that shine under the light.

It's fairly long and has a little comb to go into your hair and stay securely.

The stitching looks very well done.

I would definitely recommend this veil if you or a friend are needing one for that special day!

"Read the reviews before purchasing these shoes and everyone stated they run big. I ordered a 1/2 size smaller than I wear. Needless to say the seem to run true to size to me. Therefore they are to small. They seem to be narrow too.  Very cute shoe. Lightweight and very breathable.

"Seems to be well made and very multi-functional. The plastic sheath is loose-fitting (the scissors do not lock into it), but this facilitates its one-handed sheathing/unsheathing, considering it has a magnet on its back which allows easy affixment to metal surfaces, such as one's refrigerator or stove hood. The magnet is strong enough to hold it up, if anyone worries otherwise.

Also notable, is the rubber grips of the handle, and the very easy separation of the two blades. When the handles are opened to ~90 degrees, two two halves separate into to knives that are much easier to wash than most scissors that get liquid/dirt stuck at the base / in the hinge. My only worry is that this ease of separation will lead to a looser hinge over time, but they seem very sturdy!

"I really like this case because it adds protection while not adding very much bulk.  It does stiffen up the buttons a little, but not enough to make them unusable.  Some reviews left me with the impression this was a hard plastic material, but that is not actually the case, at least not with the blue.  I find it makes the phone a lot less slippery and less prone to dropping.

I also installed a Supershieldz Tempered Glass Screen Protector and the case does not interfere with it at all.  I really like the blue case on a white phone, the colors contrast quite nicely.

Edit:  I've been using this case for almost 3 months and I'm still very pleased with it.  My phone has accidentally fallen short distances onto a hard tile floor twice and concrete once without suffering any damage.",0

"These are must-have cases for anyone who pays several hundred dollars for a phone. I've dropped my phone down two flights of concrete steps and had not a ding on it thanks to the defender case.

My only complaint is the outer rubber shell has a tendency to unravel around the hole on the back, especially if you tend to carry your phone in your pocket like I do. And if you get a light colored shell it will get very grungy after a couple of months, so I'd stick with a darker colored shell.",0
"This is a super compact meat grinder that also has a tomato juicer and three different vegetable slicing blades so it is a multi-purpose unit that can replace several kitchen gadgets which is always a good thing especially in my limited space of a kitchen.

I like that it is easy to set up and use. It cleans up super fast and all pieces (except for base) can be placed in the dishwasher. One thing that is nice with this unit is that is also includes the three different most commonly needed vegetable slicers too. This unit can replace several kitchen items which will save money and space.

It surprised me how quit it was when running. It is a powerful meat processor! We have enjoyed using it for several weeks.

"I am completely impressed with the outstanding quality and craftsmanship of this watch box. I have enough watches to fill up 2 of these and I will be ordering another. It has 6 compartments in the top and a bottom drawer for rings, necklaces, cuff links etc. It keeps them neatly separated so none of them get damaged. This is an excellent case for your larger watches. Plenty of space and the soft cushion pillows are just about the right size for most watches. The box is beautiful it's black leather with glass on the top. The brushed nickel handle contrasts well with the beautiful black carbon fiber patterned leatherette covering. The inside is a black velour type of material. Each watch spot has a holder for the watch, you can place your watch around the holder and it doesn't let your watch bands get flattened. The box itself is large but a perfect fit on a nightstand or dresser, or maybe a vanity drawer even. The glass top allows you to see exactly where and what watches are stored inside. It is sturdy and placed well. The closure is durable and held the box shut nicely. Overall a really nice watch case that can actually hold other things too. You could easily store necklaces in here and they would not tangle, or bracelets. A great, modern, watch case that will add to any dresser or nightstand! Looks absolutely perfect on my dresser and the colors fit the overall theme of my wardrobe and furniture.

"This lightweight hoodie is great for cool summer evenings.  I have been looking for a light hoodie since I first ""borrowed"" a t-shirt weight hoodie from my husband one evening. I found a decent one from Target about a month ago, but its very light and somewhat translucent at times.  The weight of this hoodie, is much closer to what I was looking for. The sleeves are exactly the right length for me, they are long enough that I can pull them down over my hands if I want to, but they don't interfere with my various activities. The fabric feels slightly crunchy, but I think after some wearing and washing that will make it even more comfy.  Ideally, I would love a t-shirt material for a light zip up summer hoodie, however, this hoodie definitely meets my needs.  I am a bit, um, fixated, on the color blue and the royal blue is absolutely stunning! Its the perfect shade of blue for me, well saturated and matches the vibrant royal sapphire color I love so much. The hoodie seems quite well made  like it will hold up to lots of wear and use.  My only critique would be that initially the fabric isn't quite as soft as I would like.

I'm really glad I got mine with the peace of mind that it was under $20!",0
"This is a great little gadget. The mini slicer cut easily, efficiently and quickly. All the quality I expect from OXO products, which I love. While I don't think it's a kitchen ""must have"" because its pretty specific in its purpose, but it's certainly a handy tool.

I think it's worth noting that this slicer is definitely mini, as in its specifically made for smaller vegetables. I used it on a mid-sized cucumber and that's probably as big as you could go, as the blade is only a few inches wide. It wouldn't work for anything larger such as potatoes or eggplant (though they do have a large slicer for those).  It's great for the little guys and even has the guard for slicing something really small like mushrooms or Brussels sprouts and keeping your fingertips safe.

"I was looking forward to getting a food scale for portion control and now I finally have one. I was very excited when I received this in the mail, it's so sleek and cute. It's a nice stainless steel look, it matches everything in my kitchen. It's small and doesn't take much counter space. I was very intimidated after looking at the instructions, not knowing if I would be able to operate the scale correctly, but it's so simple. I understood everything right away, there was no need to feel afraid. It was delivered very securely so there was no issues with it not functioning after adding the batteries. It automatically turns off after a couple of seconds, or you can just turn it off yourself. The numbers are easy to see, they are well light and big. It will not cause any problems for elderly people or people with bad vision.

The very first thing I tried, was measuring some yogurt. I wanted half the amount of a serving, it was extremely easy to do. It was easy to place a small bowl, then zero out the scale to only measure the yogurt. It was quite fun actually, I normally log my food on an app, and this way I can accurately know how much I ate. Normally, I'm left unsure about the portions I'm logging, but now I know for sure. I'm very happy with this product, I will continue using it on a daily basis.

I often depend on others leaving honest reviews when I need to order a new item.

"I really like this bark collar but I have issues with electric shock therapy only. It great because it has sound that happens three times before the shock comes. The shock therapy is adjustable, from very low to quite high, depending on your dog's needs. The collar has to be very tight however to work, much tighter than I have keep collars on any of my dogs and this alone makes me uncomfortable, but is necessary for a perfect fit and to have the device not go off by itself. There is no manual that comes with it but is available online and can be downloaded online. I think If I had thought it about it a little more I would have preferred to get a vibrational collar instead of the shocking collar. My dog let me put it on her and she got a mild shock once, she will no longer allow the collar to be placed on her as all our dogs remove their clothes at night just as we do.
I believe this collar will work with many different kinds of dogs, but after the refusing of putting the collar back on, my dog proved to me that she can learn bad habits from this collar as well. Although it did help her stop barking for a day, it proved to me that some dogs are way smarter than they should be. Use with care, there are other ways to train a dog not to bark with far more warning signals before the shock. Although I do realize some dogs need this type of correction and believe in this product if you have one of those dogs.

"I have two roommates that often work late shifts and don't get home until after dark. Both of them have told me that they have trouble seeing the keyhole to unlock the door in the dark. This light is the perfect solution. I mounted the light on the wall a few feet away from the door so now they can easily see at night.

The way the light works is pretty cool. There's a solar panel on top that charges the built-in battery during the day, then once it gets dark enough at night, the sensor switches on the light at the low setting. It has a motion-sensor that switches the light to the bright setting when someone approaches. The light itself is fairly bright even on the low setting, and even brighter still when it switches to high.

I'm really big on green power and being eco-friendly, so I really like the fact that this light runs purely on solar energy and doesn't need any outside wiring. That also makes it very easy to install. It comes with a mounting bracket that attaches to the wall with two screws, and the light clips onto the bracket. The design is also aesthetically pleasing and well-suited to residential areas. I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest an unbiased review.

"I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. In no way did this discount alter my opinions on the product or affect my decision to purchase it. I am 5'8'', athletic build with a long torso and long legs so when it comes to buying a jumpsuit or any one piece outfit I am suuuuuper hesitant as it never looks good on me but I am planning a road trip and wanted to pack clothes that were comfortable for the ride and any side trips I decide to take. This jumpsuit is soft and durable. The sewing job does not look cheap so I do feel safe to chase my 1 year old on vacation and not worry about tears or holes. It is lightweight so it won't be too hot for these humid Michigan summers. The ultimate test was trying it on and it fit perfect. I did get a medium which is my usual size and it fit as expected. I like that the top area is not too tight so I can play around and wear a color bandeau or bra and spice up the outfit a little bit. There are pockets as well so you can stash things. Although it is cinched in at the waist I do not think in my opinion that it accentuates it in any way. In fact I think I look a bit boxy in it but I am OK with that as it is just so comfortable. Another issue I have being so tall is when I try on one piece outfits they tend to ride up into the bum area and I do not have that issue with this jumpsuit even after washing it and laying it out to dry, it did not shrink at all. This was a nice buy and I cannot wait to see how it handles my vacations this summer.",1

I am not one for makeup or looking at my ugliness at such close range but for what I lack in beauty, my wife more than makes up for it and she has her face in the mirror every morning and evening since we received this a few days ago. The rotation on it works from a ball and socket in the back and moves in any direction you need it to be in so you can look at your face or whatever for any flaws or putting on makeup close to the eyes without any problem. I looked into it close one and my eyeball was huge yet perfectly clear. I can see why my wife loves it so much because she can get her makeup on perfect every time now without either missing a spot or it being to much or whatever mishaps occur with putting that stuff on. That light ring around the perimeter is fabulous for her too. Being rechargeable means she can really use it anywhere and have good lighting. She used to light the five lights above the big 0x magnification mirror on the wall and lean forward in close so this really helps her in more ways than just being a movable mirror. She always wanted one and this was a welcome addition to what she calls her beauty secrets. Neither of us could find any flaws in the design or construction. It is just what she wanted.

"This is a very high quality mattress top protector with 100% cotton terry top and 100% polyurethane protective lining to prevent spills going all the way thru your mattress from anything that happens on the top of the mattress covers. The feel of the cotton terry is soft and does not bother me when sleeping at all. I rest assured that even with breakfast in bed, I do not have to worry much about spills damaging the mattress. This piece comes very well folded and packed and is ready to use upon arrival. I washed this after a couple of week's use and does very well in the machine in normal cycles.

"These M&Z Men's No Show Socks are breathable and don't slide down! I actually got these socks for my fiance but once I received them I had to try them on for myself; these are now my socks! I normally wear 9-10 (women) in shoes and I love the way these socks fit my feet. I actually really like no show socks with or without shoes on but sometimes they can be a pain as they seem to roll down over my heel; these socks on the other hand actually have 3 lines of silicone on the inside of the socks to keep them from sliding down (I don't even notice the silicone is there). These socks aren't thick but they aren't super thin either so even in the summer time you can wear them without getting your feet too hot. I love that you get 6 pairs! I didn't see anything in the listing but I did receive a yellow drawstring bag with my socks and I thought that was really neat especially since it's summer so you can use it for many different things! I would definitely recommend these M&Z Men's No Show Socks!

"This is an impressive fixture / trim.  Feels substantial, looks good, easy to install.  Puts light where you need it, and has a nice focused beam.  It is also dimmable.

Build Quality:
The build quality is as any I have seen, and I've used a few.  The metal has a nice smooth feel to it, and it feels substantial, not flimsy.  Has the look and feel of a high quality product.

Ease of Installation:
Has all of the installer friendly features found in more expensive units.  A snap to put in, and they stay put.  They also have a plug in connection to the screw in base portion, so you can screw in the base and then plug in the fixture, which snaps in.  This makes installation a breeze.

Light Quality:
As good as any I've seen.  You could not tell that it wasn't a much higher wattage halogen, except there is no heat coming off it.  Really astonishingly bright and pleasant light.  Better than halogen, in my view.  The parabolic reflector provides a tightly focused uniform beam of light, so its perfect for wall washer applications, or to accent artwork or decorations on a wall or shelf.  It is dimmable, which I insist on for any LED, even if I don't intend to dim it, because it means the LED driver is of a better quality.  The driver is the most critical part of the fixture, and is typically what fails first.

Value:  The price of this unit is in line with others of this type.  But the quality is definitely on higher end.  So while it is not cheap, it is a good value for a higher end adjustable trim.

Overall:  Five Stars.  Recommended.  I can't speak to its longevity, but so far I am very happy with it.

Disclosure:  I have received this sample in exchange for an honest review.  But I review it for value as if I'd paid the full price.",1
"Bought these as a gift for a friend. She said they were her size, but still fit a little small. She also said that when she put them on, anywhere that was a little stretched lost its bold black color and looked more gray. She loves the pattern though and will definitely wear them.",0
"I know I need to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables to get into a more healthy diet. It just takes so long to prep everything manually that I often leave produce to wither away in the refrigerator. With my Chefs Way Original Mandoline V-Slicer I am now able to quickly slice up all my fresh veggies and fruit as soon as I get home from the grocery store so that they are ready to toss into salads or grab for a snack. With 5 cutting options to slice and julienne, this mandoline can handle whatever you throw at it. I tried it with a variety of fruits / veggies and found that performed flawlessly every time. The stainless steel v-blade is extremely sharp.

The mandoline comes complete with three different slicing inserts and two different julienne inserts to make fine or coarse french fry like strips. It also includes a holder for the inserts which looks like a knife block made of plastic to match the mandoline.

If you care about how you're cooking looks, a mandoline is almost a required accessory to your kitchen. Very few people have the knife skill to create the same uniform slicing or julienne results that a mandoline will yield. Those who do have these skills likely don't want to spend the time to get the same results as a few seconds using a Chef's Way mandoline.

-Designed for Daily Use, Strong & Durable
-Quality High Grade Stainless Steel
-Super Sharp Blades, Strong Food-Safe ABS Plastic
-Slip-Resistant Rubber Feet to Keep it in Place While in Use

"I got this mug for myself because I am a stay at home mom, and regular coffee mugs just weren't cutting it anymore. Those of you with children know exactly what I mean... you set your coffee mug down for one reason or another (there's millions of them when you have children), and by the time you get back to it/remember where exactly you set it down, your hot coffee has now become an ice coffee minus the ice. The first thing I noticed about this travel mug is how very sturdy and well made it was. As soon as I washed it, I decided to use it, and see if it could withstand my chaotic household. I filled it up with coffee and went about my day. And of course, I forgot about it in my never-ending sea of laundry, tantrums, toddler emergencies, etc....That is until I heard a bang, and realized that one of my tiny humans had found it. I immediately rushed over to the scene, fearing I was in for a huge mess. But when I picked the travel mug up I was thrilled to see that not a drop had spilled out, and upon further examination, the coffee was still nice and hot!  Another perk of this mug is that it is dishwasher safe! While I did receive this product at a discounted price, in exchange for an honest review, that in no way alters my opinion of the coffee mug. I write all of my reviews based on the product itself and not the price.",1

"First of all, this is not a paid review - I did not receive this product for free or was paid any money to provide this review. I purchased this product to house my wrist watches. Prior to purchasing this display box I kept my watches in their original boxes. For years, I would open and close the boxes of the watches I would consider wearing to view each one. I finally decided to eliminate the hassle and buy a watch display box. After studying the different products on Amazon, I decided on this product. What a great decision! Not only is this Ohuhu watch display box an excellent value but is is also of excellent quality! My expectations weren't very high at this price point and my motivation was rather utilitarian. However, the quality has exceeded my expectations! The leather is nicely grained and the stitching is tight and uniform. The interior is divided into six sections and well finished in as soft, plush material. The watch pillows are soft with rigid end-caps, all covered in a plush material. My watched buckle or clasp firmly around the pillow for a firm hold and the end-caps keep the watch from sliding off of the pillow (a problem with the factory soft pillows on some of my watches). I like the clasp because key isn't
required to latch or unlatch the box. It has two buttons that are squeezed to release the latch and the finish is highly polished. The overall quality far exceeds the price that I paid for this display box. I am very pleased with this purchase and will buy from this provider again if I need another watch box.",1
Awesome period.,0
"This review is for the Cayman Fitness Speed Jump Rope.

I ordered this to add to a workout regimen that I have started and also my kids as well.  The appeal was that it was adjustable.
My first thought once unpacked, was that the handles (while comfortable) were a bit too short.  Also, my package did not include any of the tools to adjust the rope.  I can probably still adjust it but will have to rig it up myself.  Not too much of a problem I'm sure.  The rope itself is thin (a plus for speed ropes).  The rope movement within the handles seems pretty good and fluid.  I won't know for sure though, until I cut the rope to size.
I'm going to hold off cutting the rope until I let it fully straighten out.  (hanging for about a week or so).

Overall, this is a pretty good rope and should do the trick for my purpose.  I recommend this, but if you have rather large hands, you might want to find a different rope.

"Whether you are looking for something that will work for hydration on a long hike or going for a horseback ride, it's always nice to have the most convenient way to carry your liquids.  This Hydration Bladder System 100oz/3litres is larger than those I have used in the past, so you are able to take more water with you.  I like the fact that the opening is large enough that you could put a few ice cubes into your hydration bladder to keep it chilled longer.  The Microban feature is also nice so you won't have to worry about this hydration bladder building up bacteria, and it is very easy to clean.  This is also very easy to fill, and the dust cover on the mouthpiece is a nice touch.  I have had a couple issues with leaking a couple times, but it's not been too bad, and this depends on the way I have the hydration bladder positioned.  Overall, it's a good product.

"Name of Product: Doorbell, FiBiSonic Portable Wireless Door Bell Chime and Push Button, White

Basic Info: I chose this product due to the fact that I do not have a current doorbell at my home. I have a full security system but no doorbell. Go figure! When I received the chance to review this product I just at it and I am glad that I did. I did choose the white one as it would be more aesthetically pleasing with my house colors, however, all the colors are very neutral and look very nice. Check out was very fast and I received the product fairly quickly; prime is love. There are a lot of things to love about this product. On a side note, wow has technology really changed everything, it is a wireless door bell and not one that takes a rocket scientist to put together either. I shall explain my 5 stars below:

Pros: Very nice packaging! It was packed carefully, with quality material and it was not going to be damaged even if someone tried. Once opened, you notice it comes with EVERYTHING minus the screwdriver, which I have plenty of tools so, YES, EVERYTHING!  I carefully inspected everything and everything was pristine. Not what you would think from a lower priced electronic. Do not let the price fool you, I would and could have easily paid over $100 for this item. I put it together with ease, with one exception which would listed on the cons portion, and poof! I have a doorbell now. The doorbell comes with several options on sounds, although most not my type. I am traditional so I used the doorbell sound and I am happy with it. I have tested it out since I received it and the batteries are great, the range is great and there have been no issues. This company is wonderful and I would love to use more of their products in the future. Super simple, minimalistic and cute to boot! You have 3 options of what to use: audio, visual or both. Of course I use both because I need to hear it and the visual cue is good as well, especially for when I am using headphone or for those with difficulty hearing.

Cons: The only con I do have is that the transmitter top portion where you have to open to place the battery in is quite tough and hard to open. Now, this was an issue with me due to my long nails and could pose a potential issue with a individual with longer nails like me or wider/larger fingers. Do not fret. You can simply use something little to pry it open gently and you are good as gold. After that everything is smooth sailing and you will find it will take you no time to put everything together and place wherever you want on your home.

Recommendations: I would definitely have a screwdriver or drill handy if you are placing in spot where you need to drill a hole in concrete to hang/etc. Also, those with long nails, just be gentle. Everything else is A + and your neighbors will think you spend a ton on a fancy doorbell that actually works wonders.

Photos: I have attached photos of everything from packaging to what is comes with to opening it to instructions and more. I added a video for you to hear the sounds. I believe I have # 2.

"I've purchased 13 of these flag poles over the past 2 years and they are the best ones I've used.  One pole has been displayed outside my house for 2 years now and I've never had an issue with the flag getting tangled like all the previous flag poles I've used for the past 30+ years.  It is more expensive then cheaper styles but if you want a pole that will keep your flag from getting wrapped up, then this is the pole to use.  I got so tired of flags constantly wrapping around the pole and this has solved the problem, even in high wind thunderstorms with wind gusts greater then 40mph.",0
"I used to take my dog with me everywhere I went. The two of us were like two peas in a pod. I had an old junky vehicle so it didn't matter if her feet or claws messed up the seats because they were already old and torn anyway . But then I bought my very first brand new car. Not just any new car , but a 2016 with all the bells and whistles . One of those whistles was high-quality leather seats. When I bought the car I didn't even think of the dog riding in it.  I was only thinking about the car itself. When I got home the dog wanted to go for a ride and, needless to say, I couldn't let my 100 pound doberman stand on these brand-new leather seats. My poor honey was disappointed. I was disappointed. I had to find a solution . That's when I found this seat cover . This thing is really, genuinely, fabulous .

 It was very easy to hook up in my car. At first I was worried because it came with no instructions . But when I unfolded it and looked at it I saw that no instructions were necessary. It was very self-explanatory how this would need to go. It has four separate adjustable belts. Each belt loops around the head rest. Two to the front headrest, two to the rear ones. Each belt is completely adjustable depending on the dimensions of the inside of your vehicle . As it turns out, I did not have to adjust them at all . They fit in my car perfectly without any adjustments. There is even some extra material purposefully sewn into the sides to protect the edges of your seats , not just the top where your butt sits.  I'm especially grateful for this because dogs sometimes could scratch the sides when they're trying to jump up into your vehicle. Not only dogs but small children as well .

 There is a small Velcro slit on the each side at the bottom that allows you to open it up and hook your seatbelts if you chose to do so. That's why I think that this thing could be good for families with small children as well. Not just families with dogs.

The part that I am most happy about is the fact that this cover is generously thick in the seat area. It's not just a protectant for the purpose of keeping hair off your seats . Not at all. It seems that the main purpose in designing the quality of this car seat cover was to actually protect high-quality seating from damage such as punctures or scratches . Keeping the hair off your seats is just a bonus .

As I said previously my doberman is about 100 pounds . She's a big girl. Since she refuses to sit down in the backseat she prefers to ride standing . This means that sometimes her canine nails are pressing into the seat itself . With this brand-new leather that I have, I was very worried that she would accidentally stab a hole through it.  After setting up this car seat cover, I have full confidence that even if she were to aggressively jump around back there, there is no way that she could damage my new leather seats . This seat cover really is a great item. For that reason I am happily giving this five entire stars

 It came with its own carrying bag too. That way when you are done with it you simply fold it up, place it in the bag, and shove the bag in the trunk. It's very easy to own . It also came with a device which attaches your dog's collar to the seatbelt hook. That keeps your dog from flying out the windshield in the event of a car accident . Both the bag and the seatbelt attachment came free with the seat cover. We all love free things don't we? I sure do.

"She says
This is such a pretty cutlery set for camping. Each piece is extremely lightweight and though I tried to force bend as a test, each piece held strong. The knife has a good serrated edge for cutting meat with and the pattern on the handles is just lovely. These would go great in lunch bags. I do not know if these are dishwasher safe or not, as we hand wash.  This set is basically standard sized except for the knife, which is smaller than the average knife, but not too small. I have a feeling these won't make it to our camping bags, but into our daughters school lunch bag instead, knowing her. My husband will get into more details as hes the camping king of the house.

He says
My wife nailed it and guessed it. As I bought these for our daughter's lunch bag. As I was sick n tired of losing our good stainless steel silverware set at school, track practice, field hockey, friends, etc. So now she has her own set for school lunches and what not. All neatly kept in a zippered neoprene bag in her favorite color. Otherwise, this would make for a good camping set for sure. Far better than what you find at the big box camping stores and far better than 99% of sporks (unless you go titanium).

There are several ways to make loose leaf tea, and when I saw this cup, I thought it would be one of the most convenient ways to drink it.  You can make the tea and steep it right in the cup.  It seems like such a great idea.  This cup works, and does what it says it will do, but there are some design flaws that are hard to get past.

1.  The glass is very fragile-feeling.  I didn't break it, but it is a very thin glass, and it seems like if you are not extremely careful with it, it would crack or break.  I would have preferred a much sturdier feel to the glass.
2.  The metal lid is a huge heat conductor, and after your tea steeps, this is too hot to touch, making it very inconvenient to remove.
3.  The inner filter is not easy to get out of the cup.  The rubber at the top causes it to stick to the cup.  A handle of some sort would have been a helpful addition to the filter.
4.  The filter allows some of the tea leaves to get through, which gives the feeling of a ""pulp"" in the tea.  (see photo)
5.  The design of the handle is not ideal.  The cup itself is very hot to the touch, so holding it by the handle is the only viable option. When you attempt to hold it by the handle, your fingers slip down the handle and cause the hot cup to touch your skin.  Some sort of grip would be a welcome addition to the handle portion of the cup.
6.  There is a logo under the handle.  This is odd design to me.  If you plan to put a logo on the cup, this isn't the most convenient place to put it.  It seems like a better idea would be to leave the logo off altogether, or put it in a place where it can be seen.

However, it does filter most of the tea, and the design makes the filter much easier to empty and clean than the mesh-type filters that are common for loose-leaf tea drinkers.  I like that it is glass rather than plastic.  Hot water and plastic are not friends.  The metal lid, although hot itself, does a good job of keeping the heat in the cup, so you don't have to worry about your tea getting cold while it is steeping.  I like that the metal lid can also double as a tray for the filter portion, to keep it from leaking onto the counter.  It is very simple to use, which is good.  The overall look of the cup is nice, and is a neat conversation piece.

You would definitely need to use this cup with a saucer or coaster, because the cup is very hot and it could easily cause a ring on your furniture.  The lip of the cup is curved out, which makes drinking an odd experience.  When you expect there to be tea in your mouth... there is no tea in your mouth.  You have to tilt the cup a bit further than you would with a normal cup to get the tea out.  This is something that is easy enough to get used to, but it was odd at first, so worth mentioning here.

Overall, while there are a few design flaws that could easily be fixed, it is a good idea, and it does what it says it will do.  I received this product at a discounted price to test and give my honest and unbiased review.  With a few design fixes, this would be a great cup at a reasonable price.",1
"Pros:
+This baby bodysuit is made of very soft cotton.

"These MusicJogger headphones are so cool! I listen to music and sermons from both my Samsung Galaxy S6 and my Microsoft Tablet.

I have not used the cell phone jointly with the MusicJogger headphones too much while doing outdoor activities, but suspect it would be slightly less effective compared to indoor use. Initial connection to the headphones was simple according to the directions that were included. Charging is via a supplied USB cable to your computer or laptop. The Music Jogger is advertised to last ""up to 20 hours of music playback time."" I despise my wired earbuds now after using this product. An all around good sound system product. I have been surprised and impressed. This product was purchased at a discount in exchange for this honest review.",1
"With my previous wireless system, several times per week part or all of my house stopped getting Wifi signal and I thought it had something to do with my ISP, until someone in another city told me they had the same issue and solved it by switching to eero. I did not want to throw out my previous system (which I'm selling now) but after getting fed up with the problem I decided to buy 3 eero's and have been using it for more than a month and the problem of loosing signal in all or part of the house has disappeared.",0
"These are a good pair of fake Crocs. If you like Crocs but don't want to spend the money, these are fine. They are nothing special. They did run big, by about a whole size. I basically wear them in the lake at our cottage or while doing yard work. I do not wear for long periods of time. I do like that they can get wet and dry easier than tennis shoes.

"This lunchbox is adorable!!! I ordered it for my niece for taking her lunch to school. After it arrived though, I saw how cute it was, and may just keep it for myself. It's the perfect size. It's not too big and bulky, but will still hold a lot. It has two compartments. The main compartment, and also one on the outside. It has a nice insulated layer on the inside, and will keep your food cold and fresh all day. I really like the design of this bag as well. It's beautiful with flowers and polkadots. The colors are gorgeous as well. I believe the material is a type of nylon, I'm not sure though. It's firm, yet soft. The more I look at it, and feel it, the more I like it. The overall quality is amazing. I would absolutely recommend this lunch box to others.

I was provided a free sample for test and review purposes.",1
The boob area was a bit big for me but it will work! It was great quality! Would order again .,0
"I really wanted to like these. The sound and fit is great. When I'm on the phone, people can hear me nice and clearly too. However, as soon as I put the phone in my pocket, the reception is awful. Sometimes, even just a couple feet away from the phone, the reception cuts in and out. I have to hold the phone up near my head/ head level in order to get a clear signal talking on the phone, listening to music, or watching a video. So I dealt with the inconvenience since the sound and fit were great. I used them regularly while I ran 2 -3 miles a day and I could set them on the treadmill and still receive great reception. However, today just after a month of use, while in my ears, they malfunctioned. They turned on and off by themselves continuously about 20 times. When I took them out of my ears, I noticed they were a little wet from my sweat. So although they are advertised as sweat proof, apparently they are not even that.  It's such a shame, because they are great when they are actually working.

UPDATE: They only worked one more time after malfunctioning. Now they don't work at all and won't turn on. After nearly 5 weeks, useless.",0
Love the goggles. They don't leak! Not so much the cap. The cap is very tight. Although it probably would not leak either if I could get it on.,0
"I love having candles around the house but having candles around small children and pets can be dangerous. Since this candle is flameless it's not only safe but will last a lot longer than a real candle.

 This candle is about nine inches tall and made from wax. You need two AA batteries for the candle but the remote already has batteries included. The candle has a very faint vanilla scent to it but I really can't smell it unless I am very close to it. This looks very good with the lights out, it mimics a real candle with the flickering flame and glowing light you can even see through the wax. Up close the candle is pretty nice, the only thing I don't like it the plastic ""wick"". It looks really fake when up close and when looking down at it you can see a thin metal bar that the wick is connected to.

 You can set the timer to the candle with the remote varying from 2 hours to 8 hours. This remote also lets you change the candle from just ""light"" to ""candle"" mode which is more of a realistic flicker. If you need to the remote also has buttons to let you brighten or dim the candle.

 I love having this during power outages because I can have the remote sitting on my nightstand and the candle on the dresser. I don't have to stumble out of the bed in the dark to find anything because I have light with a touch of a button.

 I received this flameless candle for free for reviewing purposes. My review is based on my own personal use and opinions.",1

"Wasn't the best product I've ever tried. Recieved this to replace my wife's screen which had cracked. Tools are given to take the phone apart however directions have to be looked up on YouTube and are not the best whatsoever. As I said you can get your phone apart and start taking the components off to begin the change but untold of what you'll need is a knife to ""whittle"" off the old screen and then the directions on YouTube use a vacuum sealer to put the new screen on. I eventually aborted the mission and paid someone else to put a screen on. Not happy at all with this product.

"These shoes are fantastic. I bought them for hiking and trail running, I have been wearing minimalist shoes for years, and I have a pair of Merrel Trail Gloves for running. I discovered however that when I am hiking with a heavy backpack, I needed some more cushion and slightly better grip. I took me a while to find these shoes, but they have performed beautifully. I hike in mountainous terrain, which can be rocky and slippery. These shoe have helped me navigate technical trails with a fully loaded pack.
As for running, I like them for trail running and mountain-biking, but they are NOT for road running. These shoe are specially designed for trails.
They are very comfortable to wear, the toe-box is wide allowing your toes to splay out. The laces lock your feet down without constricting blood flow. Tread grips all but wet slippery rock without a problem.
THERE IS LITTLE TO NO ARCH SUPPORT! These shoes are designed for people who have trained their feet to hold an arch without support. Minimalist and barefoot runners will not have a problem adjusting to these shoes as long as they use caution and ease into a normal routine. Beginners who are not used to these types of shoe should start very slowly and step up gradually, since they will be using previously underdeveloped muscle groups. Do your research to avoid injury!",0
"I bought this item for my Nikon D 600 digital camera. The D600 is compatible with this item because it also has infrared.  The item came with two replacement batteries and also a new battery was in the apparatus.

Actually, this item should not even be rated.",0
"Ordered this item because my nephew is a mixologist and loves to have a new tool. I like that its not wooden. It seems to be more sanitary to me being stainless steel. Its super easy to clean and dishwasher safe. The rubber end kind looks like a meat beater. Gives it a good handle on smashing and moshing up things. I have goggled different recipes to use this item on, I wish it came with a small booklet, that would be cool and give us a nice extra with the purchase. The price is nice, compares to places like ross or marshals. The stainless steel and the block top matches the kitchen so its a cute prop to have out on the bar too. overall great find, great price and great to give you a little extra touch during parties or if you one to like fruity or mixed drinks.

"This is a great iron.  I am not a fan of ironing so I purchase quality irons that make the process as easy as possible.  This iron makes the process very easy.  It has a good amount of weight which makes it a very sturdy iron.  The ceramic plate is great.  It easily glides over the clothing with no problems.  I have used all heat settings and they are true to form.  The nylon setting is very light and did not burn or stain any of my clothing.  The linen setting worked well with my ""go-to"" white linen summer jacket, no stains, no burn marks.  The steam surge gives off a nice burst of steam, ideal for linen and cotton.  The water well is very large.  I do not use the provided cup, I keep a bottle of water next to my iron.  The iron heated up rather quickly which is great when you are rushing in the morning. It comes with an insulated bag to store the iron.  This is a nice idea for those with children.  I do not use it as I keep the iron in a secure place.  I would recommend this iron to anyone wanting a easier, smoother iron process.  I received this iron at a discount for my honest review.  This is my honest opinion of this iron.",1
"This is a great lifting belt to help stabilize the back and give back support while working out at the gym. I mainly use this when I do workout such as deadlifts, and back row. I also know many people like using it when they do squats as well. This is a good belt, I feel the support when I wear it, and I feel that it makes my workout better.  it has a padded lumbar support, it is easy to wear and take off.  it is pretty comfortable to wear as well. I have had multiple injuries working out before and it would really suck to hurt your back working out and having to stay out of the gym for months. Therefore, any support to help keep the back stable is greatly welcomed. I think along with making sure you use proper form when exercising, this fitness belt can be very useful to anyone who works out regularly.

"This duvet set is extremely soft.  I ordered the king size in burgundy red.  The color is very nice.  It's a very deep rich red color.  The problem I have with it is that the duvet cover is much too large for our king comforter.  It says on the package that it will fit king and California king.  It hangs off our comforter about a foot at the end of the bed.  You don't really notice unless you touch the end of the blanket down at the end of the bed.  I really like the material. It is a good quality and if it fit the comforter it would be perfect.  The pillow shams do fit our king pillows perfectly.  Before you purchase this item I would recommend measuring how big your comforter is and make sure it will fit properly.

"The knife itself can be easily fixed when it starts to fall apart, but it is annoying to have to sharpen the blade often. The blade doesn't really hold its edge for very long and the thumb mechanism to fold the knife does get wedged between the blade and body of the knife. These are easy to fix problems, but because of the easily dulled blade and the repeated little ""bugs"", I wouldn't tell someone to buy it. I recommend a solid Buck knife or an Mtech instead.",0

"I""m using this as it was a complimentary item for my honest and unbiased review. I was disappointed however, that I couldn't use all the portals (the holes for the scarves). See my photos. What's hanging in the middle row would not show if you were looking for it without checking underneath each one. It also makes the arrangement bulky. If someone out there has a better was of arranging them, I am open to suggestions.

I would not recommend this for heavier or woolen type scarves, as there just isn't enough room. I use non-slip hangers for that and I can arrange 3-4 heavier scarfs to each hanger.",1
"no problems, sharp cutter.",0
"Disclosure: I was offered this item and accepted it, promising a fair and honest review in return.

The only thing you get in this package is the bracelet, in a clear cellophane wrapper.  There is a sticker that says Multifunction Outdoors Survival Paracord Bracelet w/ Flint Fire Starter Scraper Whistle Kits Black [sic].  There are no instructions or any other documentation that tells you what you're getting with this product.  And as far as I can tell, all you get here is the paracord and a steel-and-flint fire starting combination.

Yes, the whistle works.  It is shrill and piercing, and is audible at a good distance in the woods.

I could not get the flint fire starter to produce a single spark.  Ive been a scout adult leader for almost twelve years now, so I know all about flint-and-steel firestarting, but I could not get this rig to product a single spark.

The tail-end of the 3.5 to 4m of paracord is in a visible spot, so would be easy to begin to unravel.  It is held in place by a tiny bit of hot-knife fusing at the edge.

Price: Approximately $10 for this product seems a bit much, as all it really consists of is paracord, a plastic closure (with the integrated whistle), and the unfortunate flint-and-steel components.  I would guess this should come in at more like the $8 range.

Bottom line: This is a very basic paracord bracelet; I have seen better.  One of its chief selling points is the flint-and-steel firestarting system, which failed to operate for this experienced user.",1
"I'm very happy with this keyboard case.  The set up was quick and easy.  The iPad Air 2 clips into the case with little effort, but it feels secure and doesn't seem like it will fall out.  It is a perfect fit, so the cutouts for the camera and buttons are perfectly aligned.  Pairing the iPad to the keyboard was easy.  The keyboard was charged when I got it, so it worked right away.  The keyboard has a micro USB port to recharge it.  The keyboard is responsive.  There is no delay when you type.  There are also shortcuts using the Fn button which allows you to pause/play video, control brightness, and volume.  The keyboard turns on when you open the case and connect the iPad to a magnet.  The magnet turns on the keyboard and holds the iPad in place, so it doesn't fall.  There are two magnets to use, so you have two viewing angles.  The keyboard can also be folded around the back if you just want to use it as a tablet.  It becomes quite flat when you do that.  The case around the iPad is not detachable from the keyboard.  That would have been nice, but it's not necessary.  There is another magnet that holds the case closed when you close it.  I like that too.  The keyboard case is thin, so it adds very little bulk.  The look and feel are high quality.  I would give this 4.5 stars if I could, but I can't.

Pros:
- Quick/easy setup
- Responsive
- Sleek
- Magnets for viewing and holding case closed
- Feels high end

Cons:
- Not detachable, but not a big deal

So yes deffinate reccomendation",0
"I looked at the list of infuser bottles here in Amazon and this bottle seems to be on the cheaper side. You get what you pay for so what you get is a functional and basic infuser bottle. Quality did not amaze me to be honest since the plastic was OK and cheap on the side BUT definitely solid enough that you would not really have to worry that much about it. Second gripe is that the infuser is supposed to screwed in so it would its place inside the bottle but the one that it is supposed to connect to seems to be more of a latch. In the end, we managed to screw it in place but it is somewhat uneven because the design was somewhat lackluster. Lastly, the package was OK but there were typos which you can expect from a Chinese brand. It does not spoil the whole thing but still a criticism to point out.

With the criticisms out of the way, it works; you slice and dice the fruits into the infuser (it takes up a third to a half of the inside of the bottle), you lock that infuser in place with the lock in seal cap, then finally close the whole thing with the top cap. Shake it but not stirred if you want and then leave it if you want to let the whole thing totally mixed in. Nothing complicating and this one does not really make it an ordeal for you.

All in all, I would give this 4 stars just because it is cheaper than the others and is totally functional but would not give it 5 stars since it is not high quality in my opinion.

"These earbuds came with a cloth pouch and replaceable earpieces of varying sizes. With the right size, it will not fall out even if you shake your head around or run. I can comfortably wear these for hours at a time.
They have a nice rubber cord that does not tangle as easily as some other earphones. The length of these is a pretty good length in that I can walk around listening to music with a phone in my pocket.

Sound is clear and has good amount of bass.

The mic button can be used to play/pause music as well as activate Google Now on Android. The mic functions and is clear for phone calls.

In my opinion, I prefer these to the ""drops 360Luxe,"" which seems to be the more 'premium' edition of these earphones.

Overall, I do not have any complaints about this product in terms of audio and comfort.

"This cables is amazingly tough & sturdy. And I don't just mean that it's better than wimpy little light-duty pieces of plastic. I also own the 1 & 3 ft versions of this cable, and they're so well made that I can straighten the 1' cable out, hold the very end, and the entire cable will stay completely horizontal, without bending or drooping in any way. I've never seen a cable like it. After using the shorter cables, I couldn't pass up the chance to try out this longer one.
It does, however, bend when you want it to, and is flexible enough to not be annoying. It doesn't bend nearly as easily as the cheapo cables, though, and when it's bent, it kind of likes to keep that position. It's not too different from a pipe cleaner, actually - bend it (or straighten it) into position, and it will, for the most part, keep that position until you shake it around or something like that. They will bend a complete 180 degrees, though - they're not so strong as to be inflexible. Obviously, these are made of very high quality materials, and you won't be wearing them out anytime soon. These aren't the cables to get if you're looking for something ultra lightweight and ridiculously flexible, but if you're looking for sturdy & long-lasting, these should be at the top of your list.

They also do a great job of charging. I measured the rate at which it charged, and it maxed out my phone's charging speed at 1.95A, just like the other top-of-the-line cables I've tried. (The phone is theoretically rated for 2A, but apparently the reality is a max of 1.95). They may well be capable of more than that, but that's the fastest USB-C equipment I have to test with.

Like I said before, I've never seen another cable quite this sturdy & high quality. The fact that it holds its shape against gravity is amazing to me.

Similar to the Amazon Vine program, I received a sample of this item in exchange for my unbiased professional reviews.

"I purchased the 100' hose almost a year ago for my daughter's house.  It worked fantastic all last summer and fall.  We used it and stored it as directed.

Quality Source Products guarantees this product to be leak free for 12 months from date of purchase and they have already processed a replacement - free of charge.

"This is a very nice yoga mat and it definitely meets my needs.

The strap is super long, which makes it perfect for a variety of stretches. The loops are pretty big as well, so it does work both with or without shoes. I usually do yoga barefoot or with yoga socks, but I know some people who actually like to wear shoes, so I thought that this was worth mentioning. Anyway, the foot piece is padded, which helps remove any stress on the sole of the foot. The strap is also quite strong, so you can really tug on it if you need to do so. It seems like it will last for quite awhile.

There isn't much else to say, but I do appreciate the colors. I bought the purple since it matches my yoga mat perfectly. The simple things in life make me happy.

I would definitely recommend this yoga strap to others!

"I am not sure what to think about the negative reviews for this.  I had low expectations based on the bad reviews but was happily surprised.
First, let me explain my usage & reason for buying this.  I am overweight (240 lbs) for my size (5'9"") but I am active & practice Kendo (japanese martial arts) on a regular basis.  I seem to never break a good sweat when I run a mile or 2 on my elliptical.  That is where this comes in.  I have only used it 3 times so far (for a mile each time) & WOW does it make you sweat!  It smells a little funky right out of the package... almost like a new blow-up pool raft....its plastic...  I put it on carefully... do not put it on over shoes... If so, I could see it might tear.  Also, remove any jewelry or zippers on clothing that might get snagged.  As for cleaning, when I am done, I simply reverse it inside-out when removing it... air dry it... or fill a bath tub with some mild dish soap & gently wash it & hang it to air dry.  I can see how it would be dangerous to use regularly or for extended time periods.... maybe if you have a multi-million dollar UFC fight coming up. idk.  Either way, do NOT let the negative reviews discourage you. This has been a great product that works exactly as intended if you use it properly.  If you are taller and/or bigger than me, it may not fit. If you are smaller, it would still work.

"I ordered this for my daughter to wear for dress up as what you want to be when you grow up day.  She wants to be ""fancy"" when she grows up, ""like the Queen in England.""  This feather mesh net hat stayed securely clipped into her very fine hair as she bounced around with her kindergarten classmates.  The clip easily slid into her hair without pulling it, and was not tangles when she took the hat off later that afternoon.  The hat is very ""fancy"" and will go great when we have high tea ( my Husband and his family are English born).  The hat is a great size, looking great on her smaller head or on my slightly larger head.  The mesh net and feathers for decoration make it lightweight and not heavy on your head or pulling at your hair.  I am slightly concerned that out of the packaging the mesh netting seemed to be cracking and starting to break on the backside, but it is not visible from the front. It may just be how the hat design is made with the in and out bits and curved contours.  The cracking did not get any worse after my daughter was her rambunctious self while wearing it.

"This is probably the best replacement apple watch strap I've ever had the pleasure to own/review. I have several authentic, several faux bands. In the silicone category, this is as close as it gets without spending $50. I have had several other bands that have a really crappy looking fastener button, but this is not one of them. It looks identical to the real deal. The fit and finish is the same, from buckling the strap into the watch face, right down to the satisfying light snap you get when buckling it onto your wrist. It appears that it will last a long, long time.

"I really LOVE this unique case by Vofolen! I was a little hesitant about the bold animal print, but I actually really like this attention getting case. The actual case designed is super unique in the there is a back section that slides open to hold credit cards and/or your drivers license. What's nice about this and different from another ""credit card"" case I have is that there is a separate backing in between the phone and case. So if I were to take my phone out, the credit cards are still hidden and protected. It's got great aesthetic appeal that keeps your eye moving. I think both some men and women would enjoy using this case. I've gotten so many compliments on it from both genders! The case not only looks great, but keeps out dirt and is scratch resistant, while still keeping a stylish design.
It's the perfect fit for my iPhone 6s and has precision cutouts for the side buttons and charging port. It fits nicely in my hand and has a unique wave-like design. It's very sleek and not as bulky as some other ""credit card"" cases I have. It was pretty easy to get on, but takes a little extra wiggling to get it off, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It still protects my phone, including the screen because the actual case has a thin lip that is raised just slightly above the screen so that it will take the impact of a fall, not your screen.
Overall, I would recommend this case if you're looking for a great price point for a great, everyday, durable case. Is it the quality of an Otterbox? No, but I think just looking at the pictures, you'd be able to see that for yourself. I really like this case! Thumbs up here!

"I received my Galaxy Note 5 Case, Spigen [Liquid Crystal] Ultra Thin Premium Semi-transparent Lightweight / Exact Fit / NO Bulkiness Soft Case for Galaxy Note 5 (2015) - Liquid Crystal (SGP11708) a few weeks ago. First off, I have to say how much I love Spigen products! They use high end materials that provide great protection and look stunning. Everything is meticulously designed. This case spares nothing. It is made of thin and lightweight TPU that is flexible and durable. TPU is extremely durable but has some give as well. The cutouts are all precise and all buttons are protected. I have had multiple people at work and when I am out and about, people ask me what kind of case it is. If you are looking for a case that is slim but offers excellent protection, but yet provides a modern look and feel then look know further peeps. You will love this case. Spigen offers a wide variety of cases for Samsung and competitors. I will not use any other brand whatsoever.

"I just got these clippers yesterday, after doing a bunch of research on different sites that recommend dog clippers. The price is right, and it comes with all the extra attachments you may ever want, in the case.

I charged them up overnight, and they lasted plenty long enough for me to do an all over cut, and didn't slow down for at least 3 hours of intermittent use.  (I worked on her outside on and off for a few hours, without recharging in between.)

They worked very well on my 20 lb. Pomeranian.  Even though the packaging doesn't recommend an all over cut of dense fur...I did an all over cut on her thick fur to make her more comfortable in the hot Indiana summer.

She looks very cute (although I will get better over time.)  They weren't really noisy, but still had a bit of a hum and vibration.  They are better than the ones for people. In fact, afterward, I gave my husband a hair cut with them, and even though he didn't like the idea that they were dog clippers, he let me use them....they work really, really well on people!!",0

This is a great camera for my apartment.

Setup was very easy, requiring only a brief direct LAN hookup to my DSL router to establish the connection to the camera. Then you simply download the app on your smartphone, create an account, scan the QR code at the base of the camera, and voila, you're connected! You can now remove the Ethernet cable and place the camera anywhere you like, as long as it's in wireless range of your router.

Most of the setup was straightforward, though the online documentation could provide better descriptions of the features and menu options. For instance, if you just want the camera to record only when it detects motion you have to disable the ""schedule recording"" option altogether.

Also, the camera requires an SD card (not included) to save the videos it records. It mentions using an SD card in the documentation, and there is a menu option for it as well, but for the first two days I was under the impression that it was referring to the SD drive on my laptop and that the videos would be saved to the SD card I inserted into the laptop. As it turns out, the camera itself has a Micro SD slot to store its own videos, and that's what the instructions are referencing. NOTE: Be sure to get a ""micro"" SD card (smart phone size), not the standard size SD card that you might use on your laptop. You can pick these up at Best Buy (about $15 for a 32GB Samsung card).

You can control the camera via your smartphone or your desktop/laptop. One great feature is the ability to control the camera's direction remotely. You can set the camera to a live shot, and pan it up, down, and side to side for a nearly 360 degree viewing radius.

"I was very excited to receive my 321 Strong shaker, as I love getting and trying new ones all the time...I currently own the SmartShake (in small and regular sizes) and the CycloneCup as well. I really liked the idea behind the mixer inside the container of the 321 cup, but I can't imagine it is going to last very long. It seems very flimsy as does the plastic used to make the Shaker itself, as well as the lid that screws on top. There are two parts that screw off the bottom, one is smaller for supplements and even includes a small divided supplement tray that can be taken out if you wanted to use it for pre-workout or another type of powder. The bottom one is for your protein powder. They all screw on and off nicely without issue but I do think the plastic used was very flimsy. It's nothing that I could imagine wouldn't leak inside your gym bag had it not been placed upright correctly. I haven't had any issue with leaks so far but I do use my finger to hold over the top because I don't feel that the lid snaps on very well to prevent this from happening. Unfortunately, this shaker bottle didn't impress me the way I thought it would. The picture also makes the color seem like it's a little bit frosted when, in reality, it is quite transparent. Please see my attached pictures, as I took the Shaker apart and put it back together so that you'd be able to see the wire whisk that is being used for this product. In addition, I have also used the blender ball type shakers for my protein shakes and they are quite loud. They are not the types of shakers that you would be using in a quiet area. The design of this Shaker is also quite loud and I would say that it is comparable to a blender ball type shaker. Overall, I would not have paid full price for the Shaker but I was lucky enough to have received it at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I appreciate the chance to be able to review it, as I am someone who frequents the gym quite often and uses shakers on the go a lot as well.

*Update*
After using this shaker for a longer period of time, I have added one star because it has been holding up more than I had originally thought it would. The top has not leaked on me and I find that it is nice for my iced coffee as well.",1
Great product but little damage on the cover case. its ok !,0
"This holster is everything they say it is in their videos. It's comfortable and after 1 month of use, has shown to be very durable. It seemed tight initially to draw my gun, but after a little use, it is perfect. Tight enough to be secure and won't fall out and easy enough to draw. The ability to make several adjustments with the additional spacers is an added bonus.",0
I love this bag! Seriously solid and super good looking. I love the space and serves my purposes. I keep my work files in there and they are easy to access.,0
I recently purchased two of these. One for myself and one for my husband. I believe this is one of the last models if not the last that has the cd drive built in with all the ports. We aren't ready to give up these extras so this was perfect. We have upgraded the RAM and intend to do some other modifications in the near future. For now these are perfect and run just like they should.,0
"When i was given the NEXT LEVEL toothbrush pack in return for an honest review, I jumped at the chance. At my dog's last visit to the veterinarian it was recommended that I start brushing his teeth. I love this value pack because it meets all of your pet's needs. The pack comes with a two ended toothbrush and 2 toothbrushes that  one puts on finger. The toothbrush has a long rubber handle that comfortably can be hold without any slipping from one's hand. The bristles are not too harsh but firm. I loved one of the toothbrushes that one puts on the finger because the bristles are made of rubber. This rubber toothbrush is perfect for scrubbing the pet's tongue to remove build-up. The finger toothbrushes are also great for travel.  If you have a small , hyper  pet like i do he is 3.8 lbs you may need help when brushing the pets teeth. Again product is great!",1
"Gorgeous and totally 100% practical! I bake a lot, probably why I have a few extra lbs on me,  but I adore aprons! I have a whole bunch, different styles, designs, materials, I use them for all different types of occasions, for baking parties, the list goes on. As such, I'm totally critical of them and especially their stitching because I need hem to last! I wash them often and I take care of them! The stitching on this is superb, heavy duty, and a lot of detail went into it. It's canvas and pretty much the most heavy duty apron I've ever owned LIKE EVER! The pattern on the print is perfect, the cream colored canvas fits beautifully against the striped canvas and the straps are long enough to comfortably tie around me and I'm a plus size girl!

All around beautiful apron that can take on some heavy baking and or anything you put it up to!

"I bought this watch band for my husband who is a wedding photographer and he needs a silicone band because it is the most comfortable on his wrist in the Florida heat. He has an Apple silicone watch band that he loves and wanted to try an off brand because they are significantly cheaper! He is very pleased with this band! It looks and fits almost exactly like the Apple brand (I have attached pictures comparing the two...the green one is the Apple brand). The only difference is that this LNKOO band doesn't fit as snuggly as the Apple brand, but it is nothing that you would notice while wearing. We highly recommend this watch band and plan on getting it in more colors! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own!",1
"This is a really sharp peach-colored pet carrier that Bruiser Woods would have loved.  Of course Bruiser was Elle Woodss (Reese Witherspoon) dog in Legally Blond.  My dog Liam is a chihuahua as well, but he simply has no intention of traveling in it.  The only things I can get him into is the crate to go to the vets and his stroller.  This is, however a perfect pocketbook-like carrier for small dogs who are ten pounds and under.  It would be a tight squeeze for any dog or cat above that weight..

The quality of this Frontpet is very high from the hardware to the fabric.  Ive had one other one from this company, a rolling carrier, and so I expected that quality.  The inside has a plush, removable fleece covered bottom support pad that can be removed.  It did curl from being packaged, but I rolled it the opposite way and it settled down.  It is stiff and does give the carrier its form and the support it needs.  The outside is a heavy-duty nylon that Ive seen on backpacks, but with that peach color won't be mistaken for one.  There is a side flap that can be rolled up and secured with Velcro.  The zippers are synthetic with metal pulls.  I had no problem zipping them up and they go quite smoothly

It does fold flat once I remove that bottom support.  The straps are a faux leather and the accompanying hardware like the O-rings and buckles are a sharp looking metal.  The mesh doors and top make the entire pet carrier quite breathable.  Ive seen several people who use this type of carrier and love them, but not my Liam.  The entire carrier is well-sewn and nicely designws, worthy of the likes of Bruiser woods.  This is not meant to be an airline carrier, but it could be used to carry through an airport.  Very nice carrier that Id recommend to anyone with a small dog.

"Fits good around waist, said loose fit but wow, really baggy around the legs, which is fine with me, just don't wear long boxers!",0
"This is not meant for wearing in the water!  It is too short and oversized.  Fits well if just wanting to not be exposed to the sun while outside, terrible if you want to wear in the water.  Shirt is also way too short.  XL fit good but was like wearing a L length shirt.",0
"Up until receiving these towels we have been using dishtowels that we bought when we moved into our house about eight years ago. I had been looking for new towels and I liked the color and the design of these so I decided to give them a try.
When I first open the towels I was a little put back because they are not plush like terry cloth is. These towels do you need to be washed per their washing instructions before you use them. If you use them before washing, they do not absorb any water at all. After I washed them and tried them again I noticed a dramatic difference in the their performance while drying dishes.
 These towels are a generous size, wider than most of my other dish towels. They consist of 66% polyester 18% bamboo viscose and 16% polyamide.  They are soft and almost silky to the touch. The color is a nice soft green it matches quite well with green or earthtone decor.  Initially I was not impressed with these towels but now that I've washed them and been using them for a few days I like them quite a bit.

"Our front yard needed some anti-bug love, so when I saw that this Bug Zapper was also a cute light, I was really excited to try it out. You can use in two ways, either hanging or staked in the ground, I like it hanging near out gnomes and pepper plants out front. The area is pretty large for the bugs to get trapped and they do, I have had to clean out the zapper twice already!! Which is great, that means no critters in my garden boxes! The fact that it lights up my yard at night is just an added extra bonus! In the spirit of full disclosure, I was given the above mentioned product free to facilitate this review.",1

"Great wraps,  easy to put on & easy to use. I have been working out trying to get in shape for my wedding and been lifting and these have been great for my knees. The support these give to my knees is phenomenal. These straps have allowed me to lift heavier and train harder more often.
They are cheaper than some others I have seen but they absolutely do the job right and I'm happy with them. I would recommend them to anyone going heavy on their squats or in the gym. I use these straps all the time and would definitely recommend.

But then I started using them and that's where they really wowed me! I sliced an entire bag of potatoes quickly and VERY thin with ease! This is something I've always struggled with (I'll admit, I'm not really the best in the kitchen) but was able to do with these. I have also used them on tomatoes, meat, and even a cake. Definitely worth getting a set if you have never had a ceramic knife before! I received a discount to review this product.",1
"Love it, got it when on sale and could not be happier.",0
"I received these as a free review sample. Instead of beating around the bush I'll get to the reason why I gave it five stars: it will cut through bamboo, and not just shoots, but six-to-eight footers that are nearly an inch in diameter. That alone makes me love this because large areas of my property has become home to invasive bamboo that a neighbor planted and has taken over my yard as well as others in the neighborhood.

These shears will cut through new bamboo up to eight feet tall with little effort. The operative word is 'new' because dead stands that are brown require a saw. These will also cut through brush and shrubs as fast and much easier than the other shears and trimmers I own, including long handle pruning shears.

A final reason why I rated these so highly is the construction is first rate. I did notice a slight wobble where the pinned handles met, but the blade still seated perfectly into the channel in the opposite handle, and after using these for a full day the shears were still rock solid.  The handles are also nicely designed and easy to grip and operate for long periods - especially when cutting bamboo.

Overall, these are well made and do a better job than other shears that I own or have used. Are they the best? Perhaps, but I cannot say for sure. I will say that they are perfect for my needs, and if I were to lose then I would not hesitate to replace them.",1
"Why I got the product: My brother recently had a heart attack and he's looking for things he can do that will build back up his strength without zapping him completely so I thought that a progressively increasing resistance hand grip strengthener might be helpful.

How to use the product: As you twist the knob the resistance increases and it gets harder to squeeze.

My experience with the product: I found even the easiest setting to be challenging, and of course my brother loves it.

What I know about the company: This is my first time buying from this company and I haven't heard anything about them (good or bad).

Packaging: It came in a box and everything was sealed for my protection

Color of product/design: The color isn't phenomenal, but the design is great.

Why I gave 5 stars: Ive done it too. You look at Amazon and said 4 stars? Why not 5 stars? Was something wrong with the product? Why did they give it 4 stars? Well, if the product has nothing wrong with it Im going to give it 5 stars. If it has something quirky about it, Im going to give it 4 stars. If I had to return it because of an error in shipping or I really wasn't happy with the product, but its an overall good product, it gets 3 stars. I rarely give 1 or 2 stars, but those are for the real stinkers. Like receiving a bag of chocolates that are melted together. Thats a 1. So 5 stars doesnt necessarily mean I love it which is what Amazon says it means. It just means its exactly what it says it is. Theres just no way to say I love it to some necessary items. I may mark 5 stars on my monthly subscription to toothpaste because it cleans my teeth, but that doesnt mean I actually love toothpaste. It didn't make my day betterIt just was what it said it was. Anyway, I felt the need to clarify why I give out mostly 5 stars. I hope this was helpful.

"Good product, it goes on easily and has the right amount of stiffness in the mechanism -- not too loose and not too tight. I have bought a few different kinds of these phone rings... they don't last forever but I love the functionality.

"I like the compression on these a lot, but it does tend to roll down at the top, and that is a problem when you're wearing them for a long time. I continuously have to pull them up. So I'm not sure if maybe the size chart was wrong in sizing them, I got a medium as instructed by the size chart, but they kept rolling down on the top. I have a small waist at 28 inches, and my stomach isn't that big either, so I'm thinking a medium may have been too big for me and I needed a small. But I would buy them again if the brand could do something about the rolling down. I am hoping they will make these in a whole piece suit, so that they don't roll down anymore. That would be ideal for me. Make a ONE PIECE please, because the compression is the best I've had thus far in shapewear. The material is also very durable and they are easy to put on. I would have given them five stars if they didn't roll down on the top so much.",0

"The banner is very cute arrives ready to hang.  Each letter is strung together buy satin finish white ribbon, and each letter is printed and a foil gold color.

The banner letters are a reasonable size, measuring just over 3 inches high for each letter. The letters are printed on a pink glossy cardstock, and each letter Banner peace is approximately six inches tall.

This Banner Health shorts for me and one area and that was the color combination. I was expecting the pink to read more like a baby pink and the gold to be more vibrant.  The banner that I received was colored with a pink that had more gray undertone bands with a gold that appeared more copper.  Overall it was just a darker version of what you would expect a baby girl pink to be. It was more apparent once it was set in the baby shower setting again other items like tablecloths and napkins in both pink and white colors.

It is a really cute Banner and I would buy it again but I would not match it with other baby pink items but rather incorporated into a multi color scheme (dark pink, coral, orange, yellow, etc...).

"That's good , but I expected the balls were biger than these",0
"I've had the Tough Armor and Neo Hybrid cases. Both are fantastic, but I ended up keeping the Tough Armor because it's a little heftier for my big hands and I like the flush buttons and smooth back. I also like that the back piece is separate. The Neo Hybrid's hard piece is just around the sides. I've knocked a star because the edges of the Tough Armor case are oddly sharp, which I've seen other people comment on. After a few days I stopped noticing it as much. I would give 4.5 stars if I could.

I have a PhantomSkinz protector on the screen. I previously used the case-friendly version, and now I have the regular version. The case-friendly version stops quite a bit short of the phone's edges. I like the full coverage of the regular protector, but the case does slowly push on the Phantomskinz in the corners. It's a little annoying, but I use my fingernail to smooth them back out, and it's not a big deal.

I know a lot of reviews of phone accessories seem artificial. I did NOT receive this or the Neo Hybrid for free or for a discount. I originally had the Neo Hybrid and case-friendly Phantomskinz on my phone, which I dropped in my car. It fell screen-first onto the sharp edge of the metal rails under my seat (I'm tall so my seat is all the way back). The PhantomSkinz was punctured, but luckily it didn't penetrate to the screen. The Neo Hybrid case was sliced a bit on the side, so I decided to try another case and get the full-coverage PhantomSkinz.",1

"I really liked this shower head.  A few critiques:

1. It came with no directions. This wasn't a major issue for be because I've replaced a few shower heads in the past, but I spent more time figuring out the unit than I did actually installing it,  so directions would have been helpful and eliminated this, rather unnecessary step.

2. The unit leaked. I think I need plumber's tape to close off the neck of the unit,  but with no directions,  I'll have to troubleshoot this on my own.

3. I love the streams this shower head creates.  It's a gentle,  yet powerful stream on either setting.

"I bought these specifically for yard work. We had these pesky weeds that have thorns on them. The gloves did not protect my hands. Was a little better if I put both on the same hand.

"This set is really cool. Masks, hats, ties, glasses and emojis. It is a DIY set, which i didn't realize when purchasing. Basically, you have the props, little glue circles and bamboo sticks. I would've been disappointed with this tedious diy project, but I was lucky because my daughter volunteered to put them together. The directions are simple and easy to follow, but the little glue circles don't do a good job holding it together. We had to use a piece of tape over the stick to make it hold. After we were all done, they looked awesome! My daughter's favorite props are the emojis. We are using them for her 12th birthday and she is thrilled to have fun selfies with her friends. Also, I'm looking forward to using them for our New Year's party. There are so many different ones that you can find use for them at any occasion!

"Let me first start off by saying that this is probably One of the best workout rings you'll find out there. I've had a few of them myself some of them lasting very short some of them I still have but they're a little more worn down. I've had a few of them that were pretty thick silicone which is good but the downside is that it also made holding the bar a little bit awkward. When you first receive this item it comes in a standard jewelry box wrapped in plastic which is a nice touch. After you unwrap the packaging and you'll notice that the ring is inside Styrofoam holder there are no instructions it's pretty standard. The sizing of the ring was surprisingly good I wear a size 8 and I've noticed that some fit kind of small something kind of large this one actually fit perfectly. The ring it is not terribly tight but it's not loose but I do know that when I start working out and start doing activities your fingers in and start to swell a little bit so this will be a perfect fit. One thing like about this ring is that is not a solid black ring it's got a gray stripe going along the middle which is a nice little touch to set it apart from all the other standard silicone rings. Overall this ring is a great option over a standard metal ring to wear when working out. I definitely buy this for again because of the fitting and the design. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this ring again since it's just the right fit, where you barely notice that it's there but not thin enough for it to not last a while. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased evaluation for this item. These are my opinions and thought and have not been swayed in any way.",1
"I ordered this product in a bright pink color. The color is exactly as shown in the picture. I wanted something nice and bright because I sometimes have a tendency to set my iPad down and then can't find it later. The bright pink case really makes it stand out and is helpful in this regard! I like the 2 slots to rest my iPad in--I can use whichever position happens to be most comfortable for where I am sitting and this case smoothly rotates so you can switch the screen from a horizontal to vertical position with ease. I'm also fond of the soft interior of the case. I received this product at a discounted price in return for an honest review. Based on my experience with this case, there isn't anything I would change, so I am confident in giving it a 5-star review.",1
"The earphones look great in red and black!

They could use a bit more bass.

But they do sound great ! :) Really happy with them :)",0
"Let us get the issue out of the way; the Amazon price is at least close to fair enough. I would take a second look at this product at a $15-18 value for sound quality. Although sound is decent, other factors can affect your decision to consider this product like design and color. Maybe a few more dollars would not probably be a big issue in your case with these factors added in. I have noticed that most of the issues that somehow was negative sounds like the product is defective. I cannot vouch for such claim since my unit is working fine. This review is purely an individual experience in using the product. All I can provide is try to be as objective and fair on my assessment of this product:
PROS: I'm debating whether I would give a 3 or 4 stars regarding the overall quality and performance of this product. I concluded to give it a 4 stars due to the following: sound quality = 3; design and color = 4; durability = 3.5; value = 3.5.
CONS: No volume adjustment; flimsy wiring/cable (but within the limits of most standard earphone quality.
OVERALL: As 4 stars would indicate, I like this earphones. I'm not jumping up and down with excitement though.

"My pup could use a new collar, so I had no problem with using, and reviewing, this dog collar.

As pictured, it is very similar, if not identical, to the collar that he already has.  I had blue and ordered the red one from Majestic Pet.  There is nothing special about this dog collar, when compared to the one that my pup already had from The Dollar Tree.  With that said, I don't think that it is worth $10.  It has last him for many years, and hasn't too much worn out besides a little rust on the metal portion of the collar.  I expect this collar from Majestic Pet to hold up the same.

Overall, it is a decent collar, not worth a whole lot, given the one I bought from The Dollar Tree is identical.  Would I pay $10, or even $5 for this collar?  Not at all; however, that may be my frugal and financially smart side.  Barring the price, it so far is a decent collar so I guess that it is worth the $10, I just would not usually pay that much for a dog collar.

Of note, I was sent this dog collar for free in exchange for my honest opinion.",1
"One of the best things about living in Tennessee as we get to grill out all year long. One of our favorite food is chicken wings. With these brushes we can put out our barbecue sauce and are teriyaki sauce and everybody can brush on their own flavors. We also love these when we're grilling our hamburgers we like to brush our burgers with butter or teriyaki sauce so these come in real Handy for basting those also.

"I already own a pair of these so I knew when I got these that I was going to be just as happy with these fabulous breast cancer awareness ones!! I actually got these for my roommate (she love to cook) and she loves them so much!!  They fit her well (I chose size small) they are super cute and they work just as well as the other pair that I own!  They go up just to just after your wrists which is great when your using them over the grill because they are really protective! The little circle grips are great for making sure you have a handle on whatever your holding and the thick and professional quality of these gloves are a notch above the rest! They handle the heat well and are super simple to get on and off. The packaging they came in was high quality and really professional looking and honestly made me want to go cook something right away! HAHAHAHAH. My roommate threw away all of our old pot holders and mits  and now we just use these:) will be using these in my kitchen AND for my grill all summer! :). I think anyone who get these would be very happy.

"First off, I have another bastex case that I found I like a lot more than this one. The design on the right side of the one i received is different from the other model and from other reviews of this one. The cutout for the button is not slip on but a layover type. Because of this it makes the case harder to put on and also makes the button almost flush with the outer shell, making it harder to push that button. From the looks of it the manufactuerer may have made a mistake on certain cases and put the slip on button side of the case on the left instead of the right like most other models. I really wish I would have been lucky enough to get one that was manufactured correctly. Another thing I didn't like is the colors here are not that close to the actual color. I ordered the blue and it is more of a sky/light blue than the deep blue almost purple you see here.

The good things about the case are that the cutouts for the charging port, headphone jack, and speaker are all good and the back of the case gives a nice grip so the phone won't slip out of your hand. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",1
"Does not fit the full the entire screen due to the curved edges of the 6s, but since damage is far more likely to occur in the area where the screen protector does cover, this is not such an issue for me and I do understand why that design is needed. Also, by not bringing the edges to the edge of the glass, its actually LESS LIKELY that this product will lift up from the screen over time. I use the glass protector in addition to a case, and the combination of the two really does not allow that slight bit of uncovered glass to go unprotected.

This adhered perfectly to my iPhone. In addition to the packets included to wipe down the phone (the alcohol package is often dried out), I used my own isopropyl alcohol to completely remove any residual fingerprints, etc. from the screen. A cursory wipe down on a screen that had been used without a protector may leave enough oil on the screen to prevent proper adhesion. I get the sense from reviewers who have complained about adhesion that they likely either did not realize that the alcohol pad should have been moist (e.g. that it had dried out) and consequently did not fully remove residue from the screen before applying. Even if the screen LOOKS clean, a thin layer of oil may be practically invisible, so get your own isopropyl alcohol from the drug store, wipe, wipe again, and then wipe dry. Twist the phone under the light to look for any remaining residue, and also to find those pesky dust particles that you can pull off with the sticky tape included.

There IS a slight loss of sensitivity with the protector, but not something that will impact the use of your phone. In fact, if youve always used a screen protector, you won't notice anything different, since this does not impact sensitivity any more or less than other screen protectors that Ive used. But you're not going to get the perfectly sensitive response youll get when touching the glass directly. Again, just the nature of the screen protector itself, not this brand.

"These headphones are perfect for my preschooler! We do homeschooling so I was looking for a set of headphones that would fit my small son so he's able to do his lessons without distracting his younger brother.
I love that these have such a huge sizing capability, they actual fit my one year old and me too!
There is a lot to love about these:
- They come is some pretty cool bright colors.
- They are padded on the top and ears, so they are very comfortable.
- Ther do not have any buttons or switches that make my sone want to mess with them.
- There is a built in microphone.
- The price is great
- The quality is very good
- My toddler loves to wear them

There is actually nothing about these headphones that I do not like. I would definitely recommend them.

"This S7 phone case looked really strange when I first received it, looked sort of out of place. But once you put your phone inside it makes it so much better. The detailed art of the phone really start to shine once your phone is inside. I guess its due to the back of your phone allowing the art to display a bit better and make them pop out more. Overall a very great artistic case. Definitely try this case out if you like your case to stand out from the crowd.

"There's a reason why it's a hotel branded product. The water flow is heavily restricted, and as a result, the water pressure leaves much to be desired. The dial to switch between settings requires a lot more force than should be needed, and it feels cheap once you're actually holding it. I would rather use any number of white plastic handheld showers rather than a cheap plastic that attempts to disguise itself (I've had a number of chrome-painted plastic handhelds that are great). It's nice that it comes with its own seal tape, however. If you have the money, do yourself a favor and get a better showerhead. It will be an investment toward your health and mind, like a good mattress or chair. I received this showerhead at a promotional discount for product testing purposes.",1

"The product states one size fits all. Because it is one size, I am going to say that it will fit snugly and that it should be used more as an undershirt rather than a standalone cami.

"These are unusual. Samyo offers 24 flameless tea candles, that produce a nice, bright blue light. Everything is included, including the batteries. Just pull out the tab, turn ON the switch, and you've got a flickering blue flame of colored light. They make great table decorations, or Christmas decorations for places where running an electric line is impractical. I use them in my Moroccan lamp, instead of an actual candle with a flame. Some people like to burn candles just for mood, which is fine. However, some people should not burn candles, since that can be a fire hazard. I have a problem, because my cat loves to investigate lite candles. Then he runs around with singed whiskers as proof of his curiosity. I can guarantee people will notice these, since colored LED tea lights are so uncommon.

UPDATE -- I turned this light on five days ago. Its still glowing, and I never turned it off.

"I bought this for two purposes:  1) nice humidifier for living room or bedroom that can be scented with essential oil; and 2) for therapeutic purposes for diffusing essential oil.  The tank was larger than I expected so it holds a decent amount of water and runs a long time.  It's quiet when running and puts out a lot of cool mist down to a small amount, depending on setting I choose.  It raised a small area humidity 10% after using for a few hours, which will be great in the winter when we need that.  It's too much water to adequately use for therapeutic purpose, so I limited the tank fill to 1 cup and put the drops of essential oil so it diffused it stronger.  It comes apart nicely for cleaning between uses.  As long as it continues to work as it does now, I will really enjoy having this.  LED lighting is soft, not overly bright and annoying.  Good purchase

"This is not one of those small containers that will fit in a beverage holder in an automobile.  It holds a full quart (32 oz. or 1 L) and is a little over 9 in. tall, with a 3 1/2 in. diameter.  It will hold plenty of coffee or tea for sipping all day or several servings of soup or stew for lunch.

The mouth is a full 2 in. wide, so even large ice cubes slip right in.  The lid is permanently attached, has a silicone gasket so it doesnt leak at all, and has grippy edges so it is easy to twist on and off.

The body is made of stainless steel inside and out with a fine, brushed finish except at the lip and threading, where it is polished.

It is a double-walled vacuum container, so it keeps food hot or cold for well over eight hours.  Do be careful as metal conducts heat well, so the lip of the container can get very hot.  It should be hand washed.

LifeSky provided a sample vacuum container for evaluation and review.",1
"The size small I ordered fit my top part great, but bottoms were a little tight. I gave this 4 stars for the top being so dang cute and fitting. I am 32A cup measurement and it fit perfectly. The fringe on it was well cut and all the same length. It moves nicely on my body while wearing it. I love how I can switch it up and use the straps too. The cups inside are removable if you desire to take them out. The clasp in the back was very easy to put together and stayed on securly.

Unfortunately, the bottoms didn't fit me good. I have 38in hip and they were tight. The cut is the same in front as it is back. I like how much it covered my butt. Not too much but just enough. If you have a smaller hip size/butt then this will work for you. I'd say at least a 34 just as the sizing description says below. It is stretchy so it will be comfy on. The bottoms are really cute and flowery. I am 5'9 and weigh 133lbs if this helps get a bigger picture.

I had to order order a few times until I received to correct order and size. The first order I received the wrong design and they were way too big.

My daughter likes them.,0
"I don't keep my tablet in a case full-time---I only need one for when I'm traveling, since I don't want it to get all banged up and scratched inside my carry-on.  This is a pretty good solution for that, and it deserves a full 5 stars.  Here's why:

1.  It's thoughtfully designed with the user in mind.  There are little extras that you don't find on other tablet cases:
----The slip pocket on the back comes in handy,
----The kickstand is rigid and sturdy---no wobble
----The wallet feature is a nice touch.  It won't replace your real wallet, but it's good for holding ticket stubs, baggage tags, or other small paper items when traveling,
----The wrist strap, which initially seemed useless to me, since I can't think of a time I've ever wanted to carry my tablet on my wrist, actually has a nice grommeted hole on the spine of the case.  You can detach the strap easily---and replace it with all those tiny phone charms that you haven't been able to use since cell phones stopped having holes in them......

Also, I just want to point out that while this *is* in fact for the iPad Mini, and has all the exact cutouts for iPad Mini buttons and ports, there is nothing stopping you from using it for a 7 inch Android tablet, as long as you don't need immediate access to the buttons, etc.  I have an inexpensive Android tablet that I use for things like camping--because it's cheap enough that it wouldn't be the end of the world if something happened to it.  But there are surprisingly few good Android tablet cases, and I haven't found one with this many extra features.  Sure, the size doesn't match up perfectly, but the way the case is designed, it's sort of forgiving, because the lip overlaps enough to keep the Android in the case.  Also, you can't tell from the product image, but the inner long side of the tablet pocket has an envelope flap that tucks inside, which keep your tablet from sliding out.  And the case is rigid enough that you could toss it in with your camping supplies and not worry.

A couple of other observations:
----It's definitely a vinyl product, and it looks and feels that way---but it doesn't bother me at all.  I don't need something like this to be made out of animal skin.
----The stitching is perfectly even.  It's much better than you would expect for something like this.
----There's no magnetic closure or clasp---it just shuts loosely like a book.  But again, that doesn't bother me; it's just something to be aware of.

This is a really good case for this price point, and the added wallet and slip pocket are icing on the cake.  This gets 5 stars from me

"I've been looking into various ways to convert my older game consoles to HDMI, as that's where things are going with TVs.  Most of the TVs I'm looking to buy have at most a single analog video input, so being able to consolidate consoles using HDMI is where I want to go.

I have a Japanese PlayStation 2 slim (SCPH-70000), which I use to play my imported PS1 and PS2 games.  (I have a launch model USA PS3 for USA region PS1/2/3 games as well as Japanese PS3.)  I still use it on rare occasions, and between that and my Wii (which I still use quite often), I'd struggle with a single analog input on a TV.

Now, I've tried a couple Wii to HDMI adapters, and they had a number of design issues (unnecessary upscaling that made the video look pixelated and unpleasant, audio amplification that caused it to clip and sound awful).  This exhibits none of those.  If the PS2 is outputting 480i, it sends 480i HDMI to my TV.  Likewise for 480p.  This is how it should be -- cheap upscaling doesn't buy you anything.  It means the HDMI link is sending more data than existed in the original video stream, which means the HDMI link is less reliable at longer distances.  480i/p can go a huge distance on an HDMI cable because it's sending only 270 megabits per channel, versus nearly 1.5 gigabits/channel with 1080p.  6 times the data doesn't buy you 6x the video quality, and is likely to cause more video-related issues.  So I'm very happy with the choice to just send what's being received here.

The analog sampling looks excellent to my eyes.  The video looks crisper and clearer than my component cable (I suspect my TV is doing extra processing with the component input and not to the HDMI, or maybe vice-versa).  In any case, it's a very pleasing result from this adapter.  Audio also seemed to come out of my TV at a similar volume to that of my component cable (when tested by switching inputs and cables back and forth repeatedly).  Colors also matched quite closely.

I could find nothing wrong with this adapter during my testing, which is more than I could say for the Wii adapters I've tried.  I'm going to be on the lookout for a non-upscaling Wii adapter and hope it's made by the same folks who made this one.  Then I just need to find a solution for my Dreamcast and I'm all set!  If I do come across anything of note on this, I'll be sure to come back and update my review.

A couple last things to note:
- I already had a component (red/green/blue RCA plugs) cable connected to my PS2 before I got this.  You still need to set this to Component (""Y Cb/Pb Cr/Pr"" or something like that) in the settings to get anything out of this.
- Some HDMI TVs don't like receiving 480i.  It's rare, but it happens.  Because this outputs 480i, there's a small chance you might be out of luck on your TV.  If you've enabled Component mode on the PS2 and you still get no picture, it might be good to try it on another TV to see if it's your TV being picky with 480i.  If so, you might need to find one of these that does upscale if you need an HDMI connection on your PS2.  (If you've got a spare component input on your TV, I'd go for a component cable over a cheap upscaling HDMI converter, though.)

"I bought this case for my Note 5, and I'm not impressed. You definitely get what you pay for. The pictures of the case make it appear to be sturdy and rigid to offer adequate protection, but in fact, the material is flimsy. The case is soft and rubbery, especially around the screen, which offers very little protection in the event of an accidental drop. It doesn't hug the corners, and fits a bit loosely. I thought this case would be made of some sort of firm material, especially around the edges, but it's not. If you are looking for a quality case, this isn't it. This is more of the kind you find at the Five Below stores for $5, or even at the Dollar Tree.

"This mask, snorkel, fin set has proven to be an excellent set based on my casual diving/snorkeling thus far.

Mask is easily adjustable and clarity is top notch.  As others have noted, many masks ship with a silicone coating on the inside that needs to be washed away before use to prevent blurriness/fogginess.  There are several methods (ex. toothpaste) for this so take to Google.

Fins are easily adjustable and comfortable.  The materials used to make these appear to be highly durable based on the wear and tear they have taken thus far.

Snorkel is made of quality material and did it's job adequately.

Lastly, my set (S/M size 5-8) came with a great one shoulder pack (see pictures).  This is makes for a great carrying case and significantly exceeded my expectations of the mesh bag advertised.

"It is so hard to find modest swimsuits these days, especially one piece suits. They all seem to have low cuts and high cuts in all the wrong places. It is especially frustrating when you are looking for suits for you teenage daughters. I am sure I am not the only one that cringes when you see young girls wearing nothing less than lingerie. This swimsuit is awesome. It gives us the coverage we were desiring. Even though it is a basic classic cut the print of the swimsuit gives it a fun, vibrant style. My daughter loved it! She could enjoy water sports without feeling like she needed to pull and tug at a suit to keep everything covered and in place. This suit is well made and is holding up well. It is a great little find.

"Bedtime Sleeper Bed Risers are surprisingly strong and remain in place! I was expected the bed to slide easily along my hard floors with the added bed risers. Thankfully, they do not and haven't scratched my floors either. The risers are able to take the weight of my queen sized box springs and mattress, as well as, my husband and I without concaving. We use the smallest riser only, since both put together made our bed too high for us. The risers help in two ways 1) We have more storage space under the bed and 2) It is easier to get out of bed if you have back issues! Instead of rolling to a sit up position and standing I can drop my legs over the side of the bed to stand straight up. Plus, our dog can not jump high enough to get on the bed. That was just a bonus for us. I highly recommend the risers they are high quality and very useful!!

"I ordered this for an upcoming vacation.  I wanted something aside from my usual swim dress to wear that would add a little flair.

My main reason for purchasing this was the fact that it could be worn a magnitude of different ways.  I wanted something that I could possible also wear not just as a swim cover up, but maybe as a scarf.

This fit the bill.  I liked the many color options although this did make it hard for me to narrow down. I went with something I figured would compliment my swimsuit, which was more of the hot pink option(swimsuit is black).

First I must say I really loved how this came packaged.  It was adorable!  When I took it out of the packaging I was impressed with the quality.  It felt so nice and it was nicely made.

Im still figuring out ways to wear this aside from the ways it recommended, but for me thats half the fun of it!  I also really think it looks nice as a scarf.

I am really happy with this purchase and I cant wait to try it out on vacation this summer.

"First, I will start by saying that this is a gorgeous French Press. The stainless steel makes it look very refined and classy. However, as I have already learned, it is prone to dings and scratches, so I would advise being careful to not set it down or bump it into anything too hard. (I'm sure that this is somewhat obvious. This is a particular weakness of mine.)

Functionally, it works just as it should. I love that it is double walled so that it insulates the coffee to keep it hot for a long time - one of the major reasons that I purchased this particular french press. My other french press is glass, which is not a good insulator.

As a bonus, this also comes with two extra replacement mesh filters.  The price is right on point, this is about the same amount that I paid for my glass french press, except I did not get any replacement filters with that one. In summary, this is a great french press and I would definitely recommend it. I am happy with my purchase.

"I bought these iron covers because I was sick of hearing my irons clink and clank around while driving a golf cart at different courses. Not only was the sound of them annoying, but I felt like it was damaging to my irons. So I bought these covers. I like that they have the number associated with the iron on the outside of the cover for easy selection. The covers themselves are thick and have a good amount of cushion to them. Yet they are not so bulky that they crowd the space in my golf bag. This cushion offers pretty good protection of the clubs when they bounce around and hit one another. They are also light weight. The stitching on them seems to be pretty good quality. I haven't had any issues with them falling apart yet. The covers also fit over each one of the irons with ease. This is a good and bad thing. There is a little piece of Velcro about a half inch to an inch in size that holds the cover over the iron. Compared to other covers, they are pretty nice. The one thing I wished these covers did compared to others is a tighter fit. I have a feeling that the Velcro that currently holds them on will eventually wear out and may cause the covers to fall off much easier. This will probably happen as I'm out golfing and I may loose them. The number of covers is perfect for most golfers. It covers your irons all the way from lob wedge to a number 3 iron. Overall though, they are nice covers. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good set of iron covers.

"I hate to base my whole review on price alone, as prices do fluctuate. But the current price of $18.74 for this one smallish red towel is really outrageous. The other colors are listed at 10 bucks... maybe that is the normal price. This actually is a nice enough hand or dish towel, but personally I would not pay over 5 or 6 bucks for it unless it was the last towel on Earth.",0

"This Face N Face Women's Mesh Slim Sleeveless Short Mini Flare Dress is adorable. I'm 5""3, 105 pounds, and have a petite frame. I got the size small. It fits from the waist down however the chest area is slightly little loose. It is a twist to the classic black dress. It is made out of polyester and lace that is thin. It has built-in lining and I didn't find it to be see through. Only the clear mesh fabric on the neckline/shoulder and the bottom of the dress are see through.

It falls right on the top of the knee. The fabric does get wrinkle easily. . It is comfortable to wear and doesn't constrict my movement. The dress is perfect for many occasions. You can wear it to party, dinner, night out, or birthday. In the winter, you can pair it with leggings or tights.

"This is the third android TV box that I own and it works wonderful.
This box has the newest 905 chip which is the most effective at streaming 4K content and it also has the newest 5.1 lollipop android operating system.
This box has been working perfect for me without freezing. (My second box I own is identical to this one but it freezes constantly resulting in me having to unplug it to reset it)
Having the new 5.1 operating system is nice because it plays certain things that my older box with 4.4 Kit Kat won't such as beach body on-demand that my wife has a subscription to. I'm not sure why this is but neither of them support flash player but the new box plays it fine and my old one doesn't.
This has 1 gigabyte RAM and 8gb flash rom. Although I have not needed  more memory yet it would've been nice if there were a little more but for the price I can't complain about that.
This box comes with Kodi 15.2 already installed and some of the other apps that I wanted were also easy to install through the Google play store. I also installed other AP K's easily from an SD card.
The remote that this box comes with this is kind of useless and I would recommend getting an air mouse remote or one with a touchpad. I prefer the AirMouse which makes it kind of like a Wii controller.
This box has a SD memory card slot, an HDMI port, 4 USB ports, Ethernet port, av port, and an SPDIF port.
I Would definitely recommend this android box and I'm probably going to buy another one in the future.

"I absolutely love this Large Military Outdoor Nylon, water resistant cross body bag. I tried my 15 inch HP pavilion Laptop in the back pocket, It fits but won't zip closed. So it's possible to carry it but the laptop would become wet it if rained or you got caught in a sprinkler. However it does fit a full size up to 12.1 inch tablet or a 13.6 inch laptop and another tablet as well as your phone, a few notebooks and a couple of books. It has massive pockets as well as great zippers and a hook to put your keys or water bottle on the front. The massive water bottle pocket holds up to a 32 oz stainless steel bottle with no issues. It has compression straps on the sides to evenly distribute the weight and keep the pack less messy. I fit in a 10.1 Samsung Galaxy Note tablet in the back zippered pocket, a note book, pens and other small notebooks as well as two books that are at least 2 inches thick. Then in the middle pockets I put my Amazon Fire 7 inch, as well as my phone and an electronic cigarette battery. IN the first pocket I fit another 8 inch Tablet as well as fiddly bits, an inhaler for Asthma. In the small phone pocket on the front that can be used for phone, cigarettes or e-cigarette batteries. On the strap is another pocket that is perfect for an iPhone 6 in an otter box wallet case. It fits, it's not one of those cheezy cross body bags that has pockets sized for mouse.

These are great big huge pockets great for shoes, gym clothes, socks, a jacket and some other gear including showering items. It could be used for a day pack fit in your lunch, jacket, gloves, waterbottles, and other hiking equipment with room to spare.

It would also be good for camping, carrying a sleeping bag, waterbottles, mess pack, camping food, a small stove, as well as toilet paper, washcloths, a change of clothes, shoes etc...

I highly recommend this pack as it is enormous and would be useful as a bug out bag for one person, or a bag for use while camping, hiking, fishing, or other outdoor activity. It can easily carry a camera and other equipment for watching sporting events or taking on the mountain. It would be awesome for skiing as it is water resistant and can hold a lot of stuff.

"My husband works night so he has to take lunch/dinner with him. We liked these for many reasons.
**One that they actually seal between the compartments so juices didn't mix.
**the sleeve helps keep the food hot or cold for long time
**easy microwave
**easy clean up
**freezes nicely
**dishwasher safe  I wash on top rack but my son put this on the bottom rack and there was no warping or other adverse effect.
I did break one being too rough. I am hard on things and quite impatient. You do need to take you time to get these sealed because the individual compartments being leak proof just requires more attention to matching things up. I've purchased a lot of containers over the years, but my husband says he wants more of these. They are easy to open because of the tabs and they don't pop when you open them so they don't get liquid all over/ They are durable but don't force it. If they won't close then you don't have them matched up correctly.

"This basket took my bread to a new level and I'd recommend it.

I am an amateur bread maker, having recently received a sourdough starter from King Arthur as a gift. I have been letting my dough rise in a boule form on a flat surface, and wanted to try something new. I saw a video where an artisinal bread baker was using a proofing basket to make beautiful loaves and wanted to give it a shot.

I have used this proofing basket a few times now and I've had exactly the results I had hoped for. The spiral cane shape leaves a fantastic pattern on the loaf, and it provides great structure for the dough to rise. The wicker also draws moisture away from the dough, helping to create an awesome crust. I've given a few of these loaves away, and they get oohs and ahs.

Fantastic purchase. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I will update on how this proof basket holds up to future uses.",1

"This LED Sports Armband by UCIT is super cool! If you like to run or bike at night this will definetly help you to be more visable and also feel more safe. The band has a row of LED lights on the outside. It comes with a USB cord so that you can charge it. The band goes on easy and is long enough for a variety of arm sizes. You can adjust it to be tight enough on you without any issues. The power button is the black circle with the line through the bottom. It is actually under the fabric of the band. If you click it on once it will turn on and the lights are consistent. If you press the power button twice the lights will go into a fast blink. Three times is a slow blink and four times will turn it back off. Easy Peasy. You can wear it around your arm or ankle or even just attach it to your bike or clothes. I know I will be using this for my night running from now on!

"This was sent to me for free in exchange for my review.

This will prove to be VERY handy this coming winter!

I can't tell you how often we have to ""top off"" the air in our tires because cold weather hits and the tires deflate a little. This happens several times, here in Chicago, because we never actually enter winter--we have a cold snap, then it warms up, then another cold snap.

Unfortunately, a lot of gas stations have decided that it's easier to simply not have an air pump rather than have to constantly fix it or replace the hose. And the ones that do have pumps charge--and not a quarter for all four tires, but 50 cents for each, about, so it's a few bucks in change to get air. That's fine, except sometimes you don't have enough spare change rolling around on the floor mats.

This little RoadPro pump is small enough to fit in the trunk, light enough for anyone to handle, and it actually works. It could save you in an emergency, if you have a flat and just need to get to a service station. Or, like us, when your tires are low, just pump them up to the correct inflation while your car is parked right in front of your house.

The extra features, like the safety light and tire gauge, make this an even better deal.

This is a great product that will save you aggravation, time, and money.",1
"Shirt arrived quickly however not what I had ordered for size. I ordered a XL and received a M. The shirt is very cute and is made of a stretchy material. There is a zipper on the back to aid in putting it on as it appears to be a tighter, snug fit. The arms appear long which is very nice as often shirt arms are not long enough. I don't know how it feels on as there is no way I can fit into it. I have not laundered it to be able to report on that as I am hoping I can find someone small enough to wear it.

"I'm reviewing this for my Dad. He works for the US Forest Service and purchased these for the US Forest Service for the airplanes. He said these are all they use at his Hangar because they work the best. He uses these when he goes up with the planes or goes to another location to certify aircraft. I've been around avionics and airplanes all my life, even washed them and did inventory for aircraft parts for a living for years, and I've seen some terrible (and used some) headphones. These are really nice. I'd recommend these to anyone who likes airplanes, is around airplanes or airplanes themselves, provided they can use a credit card.",0

"The purse is lovely, materials are top notch and workmanship is detailed. However, the one think that bothers me in a purse is when one end of the zipper is a flap.

And for the price I paid I think a zipper on a purse should be fully tacked down professionally. Still deciding of I send back.",0
"I'm at a loss as to how they get ultraviolet light from an LED and I'm still not sure how it's done. But the claim here on the product page is UV @ 400nm. It's not like they're trying to pull the wool over your  eyes. It's 400nm. A nm is short for nanometer. A little research in the wavelength of UV light will tell you that 400nm is right at the cusp of blue/violet and UV-a light, UV-a being the longest wavelength of the three types of UV, namely, AV-a, UV-b, and UV-c. My point here is that I don't think you're actually getting UV light capable of initiating fluorescence, the physical phenomenon whereby an atom or molecule absorbs energy and transitions to and from an excited state, in the process giving off photons of longer wavelength. In other words, you hit the substance with invisible UV light, the substance absorbs it, electrons momentarily get juiced and quickly un-juiced, at which time they give off some energy in the form of longer wavelength visible light, in this case blue or violet.

So I tested this in the bathrooms and kitchen. I tested it on my teeth, I tested it on sinks, toilets, and tubs. I tested it on my saliva. I can't say it isn't causing fluorescence, and I can't say it is. It does indeed make easier to see certain stains, soils and contaminants, because their colors will be enhanced reflectively by the blue light. It does not make it easier to see saliva or other body fluids. OxyClean shows up great, because it's made of tiny crystals. Blue-colored laundry detergent shows up great. I found laundry detergent spills near the washer I didn't notice before.

One thing it's great for is finding mold and mildew. Shine it on walls or bedspreads you haven't freshly cleaned, or any other place you suspect may contain mold or mildew. I say ""haven't freshly cleaned"" because I think it's virtually impossible to tell if your registering mold, mildew, or cleaning agent residue. I just took it into my basement and I'm pretty sure the painted sheetrock is showing some mildew. You can actually see it with the naked eye if you look real close under sunlight. It's much more evident under the 400nm light of this lamp.

I think it's a pretty useful light, but probably not good enough for CSI.

"Right now, Gracie is really into bracelets and this one just happens to be her favorite.  I won't mention why, but it has the word ""love"" in it.

It is pink, her favorite color.  It has the word love, the infinity sign and 2 hearts.  Right now, it just fits with how she feels.  The bracelet itself it cute in between each charm, the cords are braided.  It is a really cute bracelet.  It clasps all together in ""one"", instead of each cord or layer separately.  So, it gives the look of a layered bracelet with just one clasp.  That really helps, although I do still help her clasp her bracelets.  It's just the cutest bracelet she has right now.

"WishWorld Outdoor Solar Fairy String Lights, Waterproof Globe String Lights, 20ft 30 LEDs (Warm White)

These lovely globe lights will delight and decorate beautifully any home for the holidays. They also can be used for simple decorating in a backyard for any special event. They give a soft warm light to accent a fence, railing or trellis in your yard. It's easy to roll out and hang them where you'd like. Then connect the solar panel to the plastic stake and push it into the ground to power the internal batteries by the sun. There are two buttons on the back of the panel to turn them on and off and select the flashing or not flashing patterns. There is a light sensor so when it gets dark the lights turn on and do their thing. In the morning they will turn off and the batteries will charge back up. These lights are off the grid so they cost nothing to run, this is a great thing. As they are LED they will also last a long time as long as the little  kids and pets don't get tho them. I'm sure these lights will delight and impress, they truly look lovely in person. I hope my photos do them justice. Enjoy them at you function or holiday time.

I am very impressed with this small digital screen scale.  I am a bariactric patient so needless to say I weigh out the majority of my food.  I have a large food scale in my kitchen but this small one does the job just as good, doesn't take up much room plus easy to fit in your suitcase or purse if traveling.

What I like most about this scale is the sleek compact look, it comes with 2 covers which is another plus.  I mostly use it for ounces do to the fact with poultry or seafood I can weigh out 4 ozs plus I can weigh almonds and  crasins accurately for my snack or meals and know that I am not using over the amount I can have.

At first I was skeptical when I pulled out the scale from the packaging but I fell in love with it.  It may be small but it is so accurate and does the job.  I can bring it to work with me and bring on vacation with me instead of just using it at my home.  No matter where I go I will always have this little sleek scale to help me with my weight loss journey to weigh my food.

"I bought three (Jan 2015, Feb 2015 and Jan 2016).  First two to replace older (6+ yrs and triple the price) models different brand.  Installation was easy and fast compared to the older models mainly because of the T-adapter.  The T- Adapter is light plastic but still stands for more than a year and half.  So, I can not deduct for it.  I will update you later.  The other advantage over my older models is the flex steel hose rather than the clear plastic pipe (had two leaks over the past 4 yrs).

I did spend my own money on this item and my review on this item is my own, it is the same review I would have given if I had paid full price.",1
"A marvelous replacement for my aged galaxy charger, works extremely well. It's a little bulky but does a fantastic job",0
"At the time of this review these bottles were 16$ for a set of 6 bottles.  In my opinion this is a great price considering that you could pay that for  a plastic bottle.  These bottles are so nice.  I love them and love the idea they are glass.  Very environmentally friendly.  Also for those who use essential oils these bottles are great for that considering they are glass with a metal cap.
Glass is not frosted in any way shape or form.  Nice and clear and the lid fits nicely and seals the bottle perfectly.  I had no leakage from the cap at all.  The metal lid as a wrist strap on the cap and it fits my wrist nicely and should fit larger wrists also.
Overall I am very satisfied with this set of bottles,  I have nothing negative to say about them and I am sure as long as they are not dropped they should last a very long time.
I received these bottles for free for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest unbiased opinion and have come to it by using the bottles myself.",1

"They are a great idea and look good when they work.  Upon arrival only 3 worked but changed the batteries and that fixed that issue.  I use the red one on my dogs collar for walking after sundown, but it usually shuts itself off after a couple minutes. I noticed that when he runs or moves around quickly it will shut itself off somehow.  I took it apart and bent some of the connectors inside the light which seemed to help but it still shuts off on its own.  But the red light is the only one I've had him wear, maybe the other colors will hold up to the constant action of being on a dog collar.",0
"Very cute. Slightly tighter than expected, but I'm in the process of losing weight, so that's fine with me.",0
I ordered this product though Amazon. I received the product on time. The package was delivered to me sealed and in perfect condition. The product it's self was not damaged in anyway throughout delivery. I received the product exactly as described on line. I love this product. It stores it's self. Blade stayed sharp. No problem with this product other than my friend liked it so much I don't have it anymore.,1
"Whenever you are looking for a bright bulb this one is it. I have the bulb in one of my lamps I use for the backyard. On occasions I use the lamp if I have to work on my truck at night. The standard bulbs usually don't last that long. It seems like I have to replace regular bulbs constantly. I have been using this bulb for about a week now and it has been working great. It definitely has helped me out a lot. It is much brighter than a standard 100 Watt bulb. It also doesn't get as hot as standard bulbs. A side from it being bright, LED bulbs usually last longer than standard bulbs and less electricity consumption. I am planning on getting some more of these LED bulbs for a couple more lamps that I have.

"I got this to take the edge off my puppy's nails after they were clipped at the vet. It works on a puppy's nails, but I'm not sure there's enough power to do an adult dog's nails. I liked that the grinder is metal and not the paper kind thus it's easy to clean. At this point I would recommend it for puppy nails and is a great training tool if you want to continue to grind your dog's nails as they get older.

This screen protector for my iPad Pro 9.7 is by far the best I have used and trust me I have tried many!  The application was easy and no problems with those worrisome air bubble's. The screen protect is thin enough to use with a case which I use even though the protector is scratch proof and shatter proof it's my personal preference. Plus there is no glare with this screen protector. I  received this product discounted for my review and unbiased opinion.,1
"I received this today and love it. I ordered it for my husband as part of his Father's Day basket, but he was there when I opened it. He loves it is an understatement. He immediately removed his peeling case and popped this one. It looks exactly like it does in the picture. It was easy to put on his phone. He was unsure about storing his cards in it, but we tossed it around, shook it and dropped it to see if it popped open. Luckinly for me it didn't. It actually works. So I would definitely recommend this to friends. It would be a great stocking stuffer. I received this at  a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.",1
"This truly does block out all light! Perfect for day time sleepers, dark room or whatever you want it for. It feels amazing and it is super high quality and very well made. I love the grommets rather than the sleeves that a lot of curtains use. It just makes it feel more updated and fresh.  I might have to buy another one for my other window. I highly recommend!

"About the product:
This is a very nice double hammock! Its pale green color blends in with the scenery and the stitching is well made. This hammock comes with tree straps in their own separate bag, which is handy for storage! The hammock stuff bag/pocket also cinches down with an extra strap buckle and its a nice added feature. This hammock was nice and wide and would work nicely for two people! I am very pleased with it and am happy to help this company out by spreading the word about their hammocks. They are made really well! Having hammock straps included should be a must have for every hammock seller. Regular ropes just don't work as well! These ones rock!

"This Womens Strapless Floral Lace Peplum Top arrived and was exactly as pictured. I ordered the top in black in a large a size bigger than I normally wear. The fabric is very nice and with 90% nylon and 10% spandex there is some stretch to it, there is also a shirred elastic panel in the back. The top fits snug across the front and it does not slip or move around. I like the built in bra cups and I feel supported even without a bra. The top is short which looks fine on me and I will definitely be getting another top in a different color as this design is so cute for the summer.

"The supplier kindly sent me a review sample for evaluation, the opinions expressed here are entirely my own

This review is for the clear case for an iPhone 6S. It arrived in a firm box and inside was the front and back clear cover with all the ports and holes neatly cut out. It fitted on my daughters phone perfectly and included was a thin protective class front cover that was in a separate wrapping and stickers to guide you to put it on properly were also provided. They were clear and easy to understand how to use them with arrows guiding you how to fit them. Also included were 2 wipes one dry and one wet to help clean the screen.

This fitted perfectly and looks really nice, my daughter wanted the clear one as she has just replaced her old phone and has a rose gold cover and wants it to be clear to see so this cover is ideal for her. It is slightly flexible so that made it easy to fit it on as well.

Although this review is for the pink cover, there are other choices available for different designs and sizes in this listing",1
"I received this product for free/at a discounted price in accordance to my agreement to provide an unbiased, honest review in return. My first thoughts out of the box is great value. I got a huge ziploc bag filled with all the accessories includes in this product. I loved everything in the kit, even though i didn't get a chance to test it all out yet, but my favorite product in this kit so far is the selfie stick, because you don't have to use it strictly for the gopro, i used it on my galaxy s6, and it gave me some awesome tripod-like action to make the video look smoother. My only downfall with this product is the mounts, from just setting one up, the adhesive and plastic being separated gave the mounts a cheaper feeling, but obviously you cant be complaining about 1/40 things being cheap-ish quality when you only paid ~15$. But hey, you get what you pay for. In summary, im extremely happy with everything in this kit, theres no need to buy the actual gopro brand for all of this stuff, as its just overpriced plastic and velcro anyways.... Finally, if you enjoyed reading my review, please make sure to vote it as helpful, it helps me alot as an amazon reviewer and it only takes a couple seconds. Thanks so much!",1

I received this product at a discount for my honest review.  Dress was very comfortable and as expected.  Kept its form over a long period of time.

I would purchase again and recommend.,1
"Well, it took us awhile to leave a review because our pool was not ready for the summer.  Sooo, here it is, pool is ready, but still a little bit too cold.  The Sink-Float works great.  It stays on the bottom of the pool.  When the chlorine tab is gone, it will float to the top to let you know it is time for a refill.  How cool!  Saves a lot on chlorine since the other floats let a lot of the chlorine evaporate.  I read the other reviews before I purchased and all reviews help me make my choice.  This is my honest review and for that I received a discount to try this out.  They want a honest review, good or bad and I have left bad reviews before.  No amount of discount will I choose to be dishonest.  I think you will be pleased if you choose to purchase this great product.",1
"This Laptop Sleeve Bag is a perfect fit for my macbook pro 13 inch and there is enough room for my to also slide my portable drive in the bag as well. The bag does not fit the laptop charger due to the large square that causes it to bulge out too much. My laptop also has a hard case over it and I have no issues to but the laptop inside the sleeve or to remove it. Overall, the material used is of very good quality and it also comes in handy to put under the laptop when using it and preventing my legs from getting hot from the laptop. The Zipper has two zips, and they slide very smoothly. The design of the bag has it so that the zip does not rub against the laptop when it is inside of the bag. There is a pleather type of material along the edge of the sleeve (portion without the zip) that aids in better grip when holding the bag.

I have been using this bag for quick trips to campus or the library.  I haven't put it under extreme or rugged conditions so the wear and tear over the past month that I have had it. It is ideal for traveling on flights so that you can keep it close and have access to it, but also protect it from scratches. Reminder- This case is not waterproof, the neoprene material will soak up liquids and it will go to the inside of the case. This sleeve bag likely will not protect your laptop from any damage from drops or from water damage, as thick and durable as it may feel, I don't think that it will absorb any shock or protect it, so hold on to it and don't rest it anywhere that it may fall.

For the affordable price, the fact that this bag is made of quality material and that it is made to be durable,  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop sleeve.

"This swimsuit is cute, but it was a bit on the large size for my daughter, who can still sort of fit in her 3T clothes, but generally fits in 4T. The bottoms are just adorable and well enough designed. Maybe just a little too low rise for a child, but still cute. The top is not well designed. The idea is cute but the slope is way too severe and the low side is just too low. She had a lot of nipple slip anytime she pulled on the swimsuit. This will be one we wear if we are playing in the sprinkler at home, but not something I will send her out into the world in. Too bad, because it's really close to being great.

Absolutely love this cupcake tier. It is very sturdy and you don't have to worry about it going with the theme because it is clear. I feel like I could use it at a wedding as well as at a one year old's birthday party. I attached a picture of when i used it at my son's monster themed first birthday. You can see in the picture that i put cupcakes all around the bottom pieces and then used the very top one for the smash cake with no problem. The inside tube is clear so you could decorate the inside with beads or candy or just leave it clear like I did.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  Also perfect if you want something simple so that the details on the cupcakes and such show better.,1
"I purchased this #1 ZIKA Repellent Bracelet and refills because the mosquitos have been terrible this year while working in the garden. I was looking for an alternative to spraying smelly bug spray all over myself (and my children) every day.

The #1 ZIKA Repellent Bracelet includes two bracelets as well as 10 refill cartridges. The ingredients are not listed anywhere on the package, but from what I can tell, it smells similar to other mosquito repellent products that use a combination of natural insect repellents such as citronella/geranium/lavendar/peppermint. The inserts slip into a mesh pocket onto the bracelet and the bracelet closes with velcro. The bracelet is easily adjustable to fit both adults and children. It is also waterproof.

Each insert lasts up to 15 days, which means once you open it, you will have 15 days to use it up before you would need to replace the refill.

Overall, I did notice that the mosquitos seemed to leave me alone more than they have on days when I was not using any kind of repellent. I was pleasantly surprised. I have let my children use the bracelet when they are playing outside as well to keep the mosquitos away. This definitely beats spraying my kiddos with that awful smelling bug spray. I will definitely continue to use these.

I did take off one star for the price of this product. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. The opinions and review expressed above are 100% my own and not influenced in any way by Amazon or the seller. I definitely like this product and would recommend it to others, however I would like to see it sell for a bit cheaper. Overall, it is a great product and I will continue to use it.",1
"I received this Shower Head at a discounted price in exchange for a honest review.

The item was well packaged and arrived with no problems. When I took it out of the box I was surprised and pleased to find a small roll of sealant tape need to install the shower head. The 6 inch shower head is good size, much larger that the one I replaced.

Installation was so easy I would say anyone with plumbing skills from beginner up would be able to hang it. No tools needed unless your old shower head is stuck. After you put it all together by hand turn it on and look for leaks. If you find any just tighten up the joints that need it.

I love the large lever to dial through the 5 settings. On other shower heads I have always found them to be cumbersome and too tight. I found the best setting for us to be Combination. I like best where there is nice rain of water from all of the jets. The amount of water on this setting is substantial, it doesn't take very long to rinse off.

The handle has a soft grip on it that makes it easy to hang onto with wet hands. I love the stainless steel 5 foot hose that stretches out to 7 feet. The hose itself has a good quality feel to it. For us the hand held is handy to wash the dog. One option I would have liked to see on the shower head settings is off, comes in handy when washing the dog.

I gave this item 5 stars because it is awesome shower head. I love the rain down feeling from the 6 inch head. I love the quality feel and thoughtfulness give to its features.",1
"I got this bag as an option for my 15"" MacBook Pro.  It is the perfect size to hold just the computer, cord, and a writing tablet.  Anything else, it would have gotten too bulky.  I have a huge computer backpack that I take on trips.  I needed something smaller to use when running to a friend's house or a coffee shop.  It's sleek and small.  The material is durable.  I like that you have the choice to use a handle or attach the shoulder strap.  It's not very stylish, but it is very functional.

Before you read my review I would like to say that I received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review. Understand that the discount that I received does not influence my opinion on the product. I want to begin by saying that this is an amazing water bottle. I have owned insolated bottles from hydro flask and Swig Savvy and this Xtreme canteen performs just as well as the other two. In the mornings I fill up my bottle with water and some ice and by the end of the day my water is still ice cold. The bottle feels well-made and the paint looks really nice. I went with the tiffani blue color with the stainless steel lid and I love it! Overall I am really happy with my purchase. I would be happy with this bottle even if I had not received it at a discounted price.,1

"My son only has one phone case and that is because he cannot find one that is not girlie. Well this mom was able to find him one and so I ordered it for him to surprise him. I received his case in the mail the day it was due to arrive and without any damage. I took the case out of its thick plastic type bag and looked it over. It is a not so thick clear case with blue on the outside perimeter. I was satisfied with how it looked and felt. When he went to sleep I put it one his phone and this was a quick and easy process. The case felt and looked great! When he got up the next day he was very surprised and grateful! He has had this case for several weeks and has had absolutely no issues! He loves the LED feature and the look all together! The case looks as good as it did from day one.

"I received this Galaxy S7 Case, Bastex Heavy Duty Hybrid Rubber Silicone Cover with Protective Kickstand Holster Belt Clip Case for my brand new Samsung Galaxy S7. The color is lovely being that its one of my favorites  Teal.

Putting this phone case on my new Samsung Galaxy S7 was super easy! You might have to take apart the phone case into the two parts (one part being the inner rubber silicone and one part being the hard outer shell) to get it to properly fit over your phone. The phone case has a very nice grip to it - the back of the phone case has a cool textural design that prevents any sort of slipping or dropping that might occur when you are handling or using your phone. The phone case in general is awesome, sturdy, and I am finally not worried about hurting or breaking my phone!

My all-time favorite feature to this phone case is the kick-stand, by far. It works awesome and it's a pretty nice addition if you watch movies  but for me it is for watching my security camera. This has surely made my life so much easier rather than trying to find something to prop it up on so that I can view my cameras.

I have not used the holster yet but it seems to be that it would be sturdy when attached to you.

I would highly recommend this phone case to anyone looking for a good quality case. Not only is it cute but it is so convenient. 5 stars from me for sure!

"This is definitely a large litter box as others have mentioned (but not too large in my opinion). My cat is small and I still like how large it is. On the downside, It does require more litter than a normal box.

I haven't tried it yet with the door fully closed. She never had a littler box with a top so I am trying to ease her into it. I still can notice a ""litter smell"" occasionally, but again.... I keep the door open. Overall, i would recommend.",0
"I really do love this!!! First of all, I love that it comes with the straps and we didn't need to purchase them in addition to the hammock.  They were fairly easy to set up.

We recently replaced all our standard light fixtures with LED equivalents.  I really wanted something like that in the living room behind the TV. We have a large mantelpiece that stretches across most of one wall of the room. Our 50 inch TV stands on top of that. I thought it would be cool to set up a strip to light the far wall and possibly backlight the TV too. That would make the normally gloomy wall a feature so here we have the IRealist 16.4 foot strip light.

The LED Strip lighting.

The LED striplights come with basic packaging, mounted on printed cardboard sandwiched between clear sheets of vacuum formed plastic. It is frustration free; the two sheets easily separate without me using sharp tools.

Inside, you have a reel of LED strip lighting, an AC power adaptor and LED transformer with a receiver that picks up signals from the accompanying remote. The AC adaptor has a separate power cable with a two-prong plug.

The LED strip is very thin and white. I was pleased with the white color; most I have seen are black and don't go well with many home interiors which tend to be lighter colored with white trim. The strip is made of thin plastic; its almost paper thin. Its strong and flexible and doesnt rip. It has male connectors at both ends which is good because you don't have to worry as much about where you start unreeling. If the connector was at the end of the reel you would have to unreel the entire strip and work backwards which would be awkward. Because there is a connector at each side its easy to work with.

The strip is backed with what looks like 3M adhesive tape. So its ready to go. Its simple to hook everything up. The LEDs do have a polarity. So if they don't work when you first plug them in just rotate one of the connectors 180 degrees and it should work. LEDs don't normally suffer from being hooked up the wrong way for short periods. They just won't light up.

You can chop up the strip into smaller pieces; there are broken lines dividing sets of copper contact points. No spare connectors come with the set. So you will have to either purchase some separately or solder your own wires to the connectors. I decided I could get by with a single long strip if I route the strip behind the TV a certain way. It was pretty easy though I will probably go for a more professional tidy solution later using multiple pieces with extra connectors.

In Use.

The LED lights are simple to use. When they are plugged in the right way they just work. You get a large remote with a lot of buttons including on/off, brightness, an array of rainbow colored buttons to pick from plus fade and flash patterns and speed adjustment. You can also set your own presets for these too. Some extra buttons are there for your custom settings.

The range of the remote is good. You do have to make sure the antenna on the power adapter that the strip plugs in to is visible to pick up the remote signal. I was getting good response from 20 feet away which was the farthest I could go and still see the lights.

The lighting is very pleasing and can be set from a pleasant ambient lowlight to a pretty bright glaring strip. The LEDs do get quite hot at full brightness. I tested the strip to make sure it worked while still wound on the reel and the plastic real got very hot near the center. At the lower brightness settings they only get warm.

Conclusion

I really like this set. Its great for indoors. The components on the strip are fairly bare to the elements so its probably not suited for outdoor use. Outdoor strips have a thick clear rubbery coating. Since I am using these indoors its not a problem. I was impressed with the range of colors and especially the pure brilliant white. I haven't seen as bright and clean a white as these LEDs produce before. Typically white is either a warm or cool bluish cast light. These are very pure and have very good color rendering.

The strip illuminates the wall in my living room beautifully, making a feature of an otherwise dark and gloomy area. The lighting can be dimmed to comfortable levels while watching TV while still providing the benefits of a bias light. Less glare from the screen and better defined contrast and definition in the dark.

I have included a short video showing the lights working in my living room so you can get an impression of how bright they are and possibly how they might work for you.

"I had a larger adjustable showerhead that needed to be replaced due to mineral build on the inside, so I was excited to get this shower head.  I like extra pressure, so I was a bit skeptical with all the water conservation stuff now days.  I immediately removed the restrictor and installed.  Wow, the pressure was over the top.  It was like having the massager on all time.  I thought I would try it with the restrictor reinstalled and the pressure is still really nice.  It was really easy to install and will be easy to maintain.  Overall it's a nice looking and I highly recommend this shower head.

"This Sling Pack is absolutely PERFECT for me.

I am really not a back-pack type of guy. Wearing a back pack when I go shopping or out for the day just has never appealed to me as most of you reading this might also feel the same way. Yet I do not carry a murse or a mans-purse, or anything similar. If I must carry various items with me, I usually stuff as many items into my pockets as I can and then I hand-carry the rest. Well this gets quite cumbersome and with my newest cell phone reaching an all time high in size as one of the largest modern cell phones made and is considered a Phablet  part PHone and part tABLET (Galaxy Note 4) it is getting harder and harder to stuff my necessities into my pants pockets with my wallet and having to carry my sunglasses, reading glasses, shopping list, water bottle, car/house keys, an occasional  point-and-shoot camera, chap stick, snacks, aspirin, and the list goes on. If it is a cold winter day, I can usually get away with stuffing all of this stuff into a large jacket's pockets. But living here in Sunny Southern California near the beach, it rarely gets cold enough to wear a jacket.

With that said, I am in search for the best, yet most convenient bag to carry my daily gadgets and necessities in without it being a purse and without having to wear a large back pack.

Well I am happy to say, this Sling Pack really does meet my needs and it is certainly a compromise of the bags listed above.

It is compact and NOT nearly as large as a back pack. It is lightweight and does NOT have a large structure to it. It does NOT have 2 or 3 large cumbersome padded straps to get in my way. IT IS SIMPLY PERFECT !

Approximate Measurements of the storage compartment area are (not considering the strap or loop):
Height  11   inches tall
Width  8   inches wide (not considering the side pocket)
Thickness  4   inches from front to back.

The above measurements are approximations only and can vary from one sling pack to another.

The Front:
The front of this Sling Pack is adorned with 3 Front-Facing Storage areas/pockets.
2 of these smaller front-facing storage pockets are secured with top facing zippers and the inside of these small zippered pockets are plain-and-simple. The zippers are accented with metal zipper-pulls finished with an antiqued appearance. No dividers or linings are present in the small pockets. PERFECT !
An additional pocket is laid upon the upper pocket that I described above. It does not have a zipper and is simply an easy-access slot for quickly retrieving an item (but it is not secured with a flap or zipper  so only put something in this area that is not valuable such as a bag of trail mix or a pencil or ect. - I would not put my car keys or cell phone or wallet in the unsecured storage pocket as these items could easily fall out. It is perfect for anything else.

The Side:
To the left of the sling pack you will find a small SIDE-POCKET. This side pocket has a well-made flap that extends half-way down the length of the side-pocket. This flap is secured with a magnetic clasp. The edges of the flap and the upper edge of the pocket's opening is finished in a contrasting PU leather. A very nice touch.
The MAIN Storage Compartment:
The main storage compartment is secured with a top facing zipper and is adorned with a matching metal zipper-pull just identical to the other 2 zipper-pulls.

Inside of the Main Storage Compartment you can fill with your necessities from top to bottom and from side to side. It is a large area.

The main storage compartment is beautifully lined with a soft fabric of the same color as the outer canvas. It is much softer than canvas so I would feel comfortable storing delicate items in it such as a tablet with its sensitive screen or a small camera that also has a sensitive screen.

Within the back panel of the main storage compartment, you will find adequate and protective padding incorporated within and sandwiched between the soft internal lining fabric and the external canvas.

Also incorporated into the back panel of the interior of the main storage compartment is another zippered pouch which extends only half way down the inside of the main compartment (it is a shallow pouch so that you don't have to dig to the bottom of this sling pack to find something small). This shallow zippered pouch is completely secured as it is within the inside of the main storage compartment. This is where I would put my most valuable items such as my car/house keys or cell phone if I am not retrieving it often.

The front panel WITHIN the interior of  main storage area is equipped with 2 additional storage pockets. These 2 pockets are not equipped with zippers or flaps. They are simply slip-in type of pockets for items such as pens, notes, receipts, ect. but they are secured within the interior of the main storage area with the external zipper at the top of the sling pack.

The Strap:
The strap is awesome !
Constructed of very heavy-duty webbing at a whopping 1   inches wide at the un-padded area.
The strap is padded and is 2   inches wide at the padded area of the strap..
It is wide. It is heavy duty.
It is Adjustable.

It has an extremely  large and robust plastic male-female type of buckle connector.
It has an industrial strength metal adjustment slider for adjusting the straps length.

The Top:
You will find a handy finger-loop to hang your Sling Pack with or to carry your sling pack with.

The color I received is a Dark Chocolate Brown Canvas with contrast PU Leather edges and stripes throughout.

The front is decorated with trendy colorful patches but are far from being considered juvenile in style. A nice trendy touch for the young, old, male or female.

All in all, this BEAUTIFUL Cotton Canvas Vintage Sling Pack certainly is a product that I would be very proud to recommend to a friend or a potential buyer, to keep for myself, or to give as a WONDERFUL Holiday gift.

"I ordered the shirt larger than my normal size because I like for my t-shirts to fit loose. Of course, once the shirt is washed it shrinks so I lost some of the looseness. I still like the shirt but just wish it didn't shrink so much. The shirt was very comfortable.",0

"The Google cardboard by d-scope was easy enough to put together without reading the instructions. I had looked at the instructions prior to putting it together and it was just confusing me so I put them down and matched the numbers together and it was done. I downloaded the app, followed the instructions of using the correct qr code (have to do that for every VR app you downloadand) to calibrate your phones settings and  in no time was up and running. I do want to tell everyone that you can look at the apps but there is no button to click so for gaming it doesn't work. It definitely helps to have one of these to see what VR is all about.  I was able to look through this with no glasses on and I'm far sighted with +2 glasses for reading. I was surprised about that.  I actually had some motion sickness for about 1/2 hour after I was done each time.

There are plenty of ways you could use this - as a timer switch to make sure your iron is off.  In my case, we have a small fan which we use to dry out our shower stall after use.  We often leave the fan on far longer than we want, or turn it off early.  This allows us to set the fan to go off in an hour or two.

The one criticism is that the arrow is hard to see.  It's a raised arrow, but still white on white.  I'll be putting a piece of electrical tape on it to make it easier to see. UPDATE - I put some black electrical tape on the arrow, then a narrow, medium, and wide strip at the 1, 2, and 3 hour marks which are the ones I use the most.  Very handy.,

Other uses - as an auto-off for curling irons, soldering irons, space heaters or anything you don't want to be left on for too long - note the power limit of 1875 watts however.,

It is amazing, and extremely cool
The customization in color display and the different possibilities as random play are great.

The installation is very easy; I did not have any troubles at all.
All functions are controlled trough an application with a smart device (phone or tablet) via Bluetooth.
So to start the only thing you need to do is to tread in smart LED bulb, and make sure the power to the bulb is on.
Then you need to install the PLAYBULB X, app that you can find in the playstore.
Turn on the Bluetooth in your smart device open the PLAYBULB X app and pair the smart device to the light bulb.
Thought you can install the app in one than more device, only one device can access the light bulb at a time, in other words if you install the app and the bulb pair your phone and table, only one of the devices can have the Bluetooth on, otherwise the bulb may connect to either device, which may not be the one you wish to use.

Another idea is that you can use an old Smartphone that you have laying in a drawer and dedicated it for use with the LED bulb.
In my case the lamp were I installed the bulb, had already a wireless IR remote control plug, so after I set the LED light to a pattern, I decided to keep using the IR control.

I have to make a note about this, once you program the bulb with the app with a pattern such as Rainbow Fade, which is a constant color change diming and lighting up (you can adjust the speed of the change), you may turn on and off the light with the lamp switch, the settings will stay regardless if your phone/Bluetooth is on or off. Of course you can turn off the light with your phone, but I founded easier to keep things less complicated at home.

Now I have an accent light in the formal dining room, which was mainly dark when not in use.
I love the product, and I love the app. Thought I would have be happier  if the interface would had been via WI-FI instead of Bluetooth, which will had made it more easily accessible with all smart devices at the same time in my home, instead of Bluetooth one at a time.
Overall the product has quality; it works flawless, zero defects, dependable and uncomplicated app, easy pairing, nice range of tones and colors.
Just to make sure, I want to mention that this light bulb can also provide you with a clear steady white light as you need it, or fix any color that you wish.
I hope that you like the review, below are pictures of the light bulb, and a lot of pictures of the app so you will be able to understand it better. If you have any questions please let me know.

I received the light bulb form the vendor with a promo code, for me to test and evaluate, and to provide my honest opinion.",1

"I can't say enough great things about this dress.  The material is so much thicker than I expected and it drapes beautifully.  It's super flattering, too.  It is cut ""appropriately"" low, not too low and is very class.  I also have this dress in black.  I'm very impressed and will probably buy this in a 3rd collar.  I ordered one size up ""just in case"" and because of the nature of the material it drapes well.  If you are looking for a ""perfect"" or contoured/snug fit, it's true to size.

I did have to go against the instructions and use a steam iron to get the wrinkles out, but the ironed out great.",0
"Hello I would like to review this new item today it is the :
Meilan Smart Bike Tail LED Flashing Light X 6
This is sold by :
Meilan
I was looking online for a bike light for one of my five son's as he has a new bike . I saw this smart bike tail LED flashing light .
When it ca to us via Amazon Prime mailing system it was in a nice retail box .
He installed it on his bike within 5 minutes from the package . The directions made it so easy for him . We waited until almost dark to try the lights . We found it to be very bright and hard to miss . Which is great for a bike light . I would not recommend for you to glance too long at it .
I would like to take a moment and say thank you for reading my review and I do hope that it has been of some help.
I love to write online reviews in my spare time . I like you try to read the past reviews so as I will know extacly

"The pants look nice... they were too small for me. However, I can neither confirm nor deny that I may or may not have gained back a few of the pounds I lost that allowed me to fit into a 14 for a while.  ... So...

"I really like these blue tooth ear buts by Francois Et Mimi, I have several pairs of earbuds/headphones, some blue tooth and some corded, But I have found  these particular ones to be my favorite. First of all and most important they have very good sound, Second, They fit and stay in place better than any I have tried, Third they charge fast and hold a charge for several hours of constant listening, and last but definitely not least, I personally have found them to be more user friendly. Not only do they pair very easily, But all of the functions from volume to changing songs and even answering a call are flawlessly easy! They are without a doubt my go to buds, and even though I did receive this product for free, a review although I am sure appreciated was neither requested or required. It is however my opinion that they are a very well made product that I am sure you will enjoy as much as I have and will continue to in the future.

Straight out of the of the box they seemed to impress me and others must be impressed as well since I have been getting lots of compliments on these anytime they are in use.

Included with my speakers were a charging cord, an aux cable and a cord that is used to connect the two speakers. You have to have both speakers connected with the cord in order for both of them to work The front of one of the speakers features a power button and volume buttons which have additional features as well. You simply hold in the power button for a few seconds and the speaker turns on. I haven't had any issues at all with these speakers syncing to my phone. They sync fairly quickly and I don't have to go into my bluetooth settings on my phone each time I use them as they tend to sync on their own.

As soon as your speakers are synced with your bluetooth or connected with your device, you can begin playing music. The lights turn on automatically once the speakers are turned on and the water starts shooting up as soon as any sounds are played through your speakers. The water shoots up at different heights according to the beats of your music. These are so fun to watch and have been quite entertaining for my children. My husband even took these in the basement with him yesterday to listen to music during his workout.

The sound quality with these seems pretty OK. I do have other speakers with better sound quality but the special effects with these make them worth it and the music isn't compromised enough that it effects my opinion in any way. The volume can potentially become fairly loud if desired which is nice, because not all bluetooth speakers are created equally when it comes to volume options. The battery life has been as expected along with charging time thus far.

So far I am super pleased with these neat speakers and I would definitely recommend them. These would make a super neat gift. I haven't had any issues with these to date but I will absolutely be sure to update my review if I do.

"The womens surplice V neck short sleeve elastic waist dress has me torn. I bought it in gray and I LOVE it, but I need Spanx to be able to wear it out in public because of how anal retentive I am about showing my chub, and it hangs on my tush in a way that I don't care for unless Im wearing a shawl over it or a cover up. Aside from that, I love the dress. The material is awesomenot too thick, not too thinit feels soft and comfortable.  The cut is nice, its flattering on my body aside from the tush, and I like that its a plus sized dress with sleeves because for some reason many plus sized dresses are short sleeves or no sleeves and as a thicker girl, I don't want to show my upper arms.  I really like the dress, but right now I use it with a cover up or as a nightgown.

"I recently purchased this water quality test meter as the one that came with my zero water pitcher got lost in my most recent move and has yet to be recovered. This was a much cheaper alternative then buying one directly from the manufacturer of my water picture. We have had water where I live in kentucky and it does not taste very good drinking it directly from the tap so I use a water pitcher to filter the water I drink. This water quality test meter worked perfectly and I was impressed with how well it worked for the price. I'll admit I had low expectations when I purchased this because of the price, but it has blew my mind. It has been about 2 months since I moved so I have not got to test the water in my pitcher lately to see if it was time for a new filter. The day I received this I tested my water and indeed it was time for a new filter. I went and purchased a new filter and tested my water again and this gave a very accurate reading of 000 which is spot on for my water filter. It is very easy to use and I honestly did not even have to read the directions to use this water meter. It is also  a plus that it comes with a pouch for easy storage. I would definitely recommend this to anyone as this is a much cheaper alternative than purchasing a water meter test stick from the manufacturer of my water pitcher and was spot on with the reading and very accurate.

"I can't even begin to explain the depths of my disappointment with DeWalt over this product, specifically the batteries.  The trimmer itself seemed good for the few minutes I was able to use it.  I have several corded DeWalt tools and have always loved them.  This one product and the way DeWalt has handled my issues with it has ruined my trust for DeWalt products.

  I purchased this and received a free 3 amp battery to supplement the included 5 amp battery.  It should have been a good deal.  Instead it has turned into a massive pain.  When I received the trimmer, I was able to use it one time, going through both batteries.  I brought the batteries inside and threw the 5 amp battery on the included charger.  I left it there overnight but when I came back the next day, the battery was still dead.  I tossed the 3 amp battery on the charger and it also did not charge.  I called DeWalt support and after discussing the issue, they decided to ship me a new charger.  It made more sense that I'd received a dead charger than 2 dead batteries.  The support process was relatively easy overall.

  Fast forward roughly a week later and the new charger shows up.  I drop the 5 amp on, it won't charge.  I drop the 3 amp on, it also won't charge.  I call DeWalt support back and they apologize profusely.  They then say they are shipping new batteries and I should have them in the same time frame as the charger, so ~1 week.  10 days goes by and no batteries are delivered.  I call DeWalt support back and what am I told?  All the batteries are on back order until the middle of July at the earliest.  Couple that with a 7-10 day wait for shipping and I'll get to use the trimmer I bought in the end of May, sometime in August.  There was nothing at all the support staff could do except say ""They'll ship your batteries when they become available"".

  The last support guy I spoke with was able to give me a phone number for the executive service team.  I've called and left a message but have not received a call back.  At this point I doubt they'll call at all.  If every 20 volt battery they have is on back order for over a month, they aren't going to call me because there's nothing they can do about it.  They must have gotten a massive shipment of garbage batteries.  They aren't going to be replacing all the dead batteries already packaged in boxes with these trimmers or other tools either, so it's going to be a crap shoot for whether or not the battery in the next box is good or not.

  Regardless, I'm going back to Makita.  I have several of their products and have never been disappointed.  My almost 20 year old 12 volt cordless drill still works as well as the day I bought it.  I'm still using the original batteries to boot.",1
"My husband was asking for this for one of our vehicles. It stays in place without any issues, and holds a wide variety of phone sizes. He uses a giant phone, a galaxy note, and I use an iPhone 6. It works for either one, even with the cases on. For his note, it barely fits with it as wide as it goes, but it does fit with the case on. Neither of our phones have ever fallen or slipped out while in this. It's great because we can use it to GPS our way to a location, and the map is right there at eye level. We are very pleased with the product.

I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a way to hold your phone up by the dash.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of the product. It in no way affects my opinion and I would buy it again.",1
This material is extremely light weight & compact when empty.  It seems tough enough that it would handle overfilling & extreme pressure. ( not going to try it though).  The material needs to be scruptiously protected from sharp objects though.  I played with the sample of material included for that purpose.  My weatherman knife easily penetrated.  Other less sharp points needed more force.  If you want more puncture resistance then you need heavy rubber bladder styles wieghing &  costing much much more. I got exactly what I wanted.,1
"This armband is really large. Very durable but lightweight. The material feels great, comfortable and it straps on a large mans arm or a smaller kids arm. Fully adjustable. This armband is unstructured and the pouch is large. There is an elastic band, inside, with grips to hold my phone in place. There is room behind that for a slender wallet or money, In the very back is a small compartment for a key fob or a regular car key. There is also a velcro strap located on the exterior side of the armband to hold my sports headphones for easy access!

The clear, plastic face allows for touch screen access, which works with no problem. The armband came with an extender for larger arms. This accessory frees up my pockets and hands while I'm walking or working out at the gym.

My fiance really likes this one because it larger than all the other ones, and since he has larger arms, it is able to reach around better. It did come with an extender but he doesn't need it. But it's good to know that if he did or someone else did when they order it, they can use it. I have seen those bigger armed guys working out and I know they would need the extender.

I did receive this for free or a discounted price for my honest opinion.

"I am one of those people who loves to wear rings, and I also love to forget I am wearing them. That means I don't like bulky or uncomfortable rings, and I don't like to have to remember to take them off when I rinse something in the kitchen, give a bath to my kid or take a shower myself.

This ring is not only beautiful but it is also comfortable to wear, very shiny and smooth and will not tarnish or give you an allergic reaction. Win, win, win!

I wear a size 7 on my right hand's ring finger and this one fits super comfortably but without coming off, not tight at all. I really hope the stones stay in place long term, that is the only downside I could imagine happening with this ring, if anything. Unless that happens in the future then my review will stay 5 stars, I love it. As of now, they are placed very well on the ring and don't look like they will be a problem at all.

This ships from China so it takes a while to arrive, but I got it a few days before it was actually supposed to be here.

"These are really strong and durable bungee cords!  My husband uses bungee cords a lot, and is always needing more, so this set of 24 is perfect for us.  He was very impressed with the quality and said they feel stronger than others he has bought before from Walmart when he compared the two different kinds.  He hasn't had a chance to use them himself on something like strapping something to his 4-wheeler, since hes had to work out of town this week, but I did some of my own testing and found that they are really tough!  I have a beach/camping chair that someone lost the carrying bag to, so it doesnt stay folded up when I carry it. Well I solved that problem very easily with one blue strap around the legs of the chair.  Aslo I have an older styrofoam cooler that I love because it really keeps things cold, but the handle and latches broke.  Well, I fixed that easily by connecting a green strap and a blue strap and going around it.

I know the product description says the kit comes in assorted sizes with elastic straps rated up to 132 lb. tensile strength, and I assume thats the biggest ones.  I checked to see how some of the smaller ones do with some weights I had sitting close by.  The total of my ankle weights and hand weights was over 21 pounds, and the blue strap, which is the 4th size down from the largest, held it up without appearing to be strained a bit.  I really think it could easily handle 50+ pounds.  Then I put the weight on the smallest straps.  I had to connect two together to reach around the top of the stand I was using to hold it all up, but I think that doesnt really change the amount of strain that gets put on each one.  This time I could definitely see the straps were being stretched quite a bit and somewhat strained, but they held up the weight.

Okay you may laugh at the different ways I tested out these straps, but I do plan to keep this set in the house so I can use them too! :P  Maybe Im not hauling heavy equipment on a trailer or anything like that, but I am glad to know they can handle whatever I need them to help me with!  The carrying case is convenient, and with the lifetime guarantee, this set is a great value!

"I ordered the zipper front sleeveless elastic waist harem jumpsuit pant with pockets in red. It is so cute!! The material is mostly polyester with a little bit of spandex. It has a soft jersey jumpsuit look with an adjustable neckline and the pants are slouchy and tapered at the bottom. I ordered a medium and it fit me just right, I am pretty curvy. I have a small waist but curvy elsewhere. Its really soft and has a stretchy feel to it. Make sure to hand wash cold. I am always on the lookout for a great jumpsuit. I find them to be very comfortable to just throw on and go out. I have had some issues finding the perfect jumpsuit because its either perfect on my waste and nowhere else or its perfect everywhere else and not on my waist. This one fits just right! I love it, its very cute. It kind of gives me the gypsy feel because the bottom is flowy so its perfect for the summer. I just throw it on and go. It has pockets which is great to hold lipstick or whatever you need. They are deep pockets so you don't have to worry about things falling out. The red color is so nice! Its not a bright red, its more of a deep red almost burgundy I guess you could say and its the perfect shade. The zipper is gold which works really well with the red.

I love this holster. Retention is good on it. Didnt have to tighten it.,0
"Daily shoes did it again!! These are gorgeous!! I ordered them in red and I couldn't be more pleased with the color, it's the perfect shade of red. It was not too bright or too orange of a red it was just perfect! I'm in love with these heels.

Another plus about these heels are that they are perfect for the office or for going out, they are so versatile, they work with jeans or skirts or dresses, can you tell I love these?! Oh did I mention the buckle on the side just gives it a great chic look!

I wear a 71/2 -8 depending on the shoe so I went with a 8 and they fit perfect! Usually with pointed toe shoes you want to give yourself some toe room.

The heel is a great height and very respectable, it also will not hurt your feet if your dancing or even just at work all day. I'm very pleased by the quality of these heels also they feel like they will last a long time. Also to make them last longer the provided new high heel tips?

I recommend these heels to anyone and I like how they have so many colors to choose from.

"As I point out in many of my Reviews on Amcrest products, they go above and beyond to offer products that are quick easy to use for non-techy folks.  As with most software, this approach inevitably results in compatibility issues and problems sometimes.  Thankfully on all of the previous Amcrest products Ive used, the backbone of the software is relatively solid, and the options to fix whatever issue is occurring are readily accessible and functional for someone who knows what to look for.

Unfortunately this NVR performs neither task well:  The easy options often fail right out of the gate, and the techy options are either broken, full of security flaws, or outright missing.  Really frustrating.  It does have a lot of good things going for it, but unfortunately the software renders the entire experience a little headache-inducing across the board.  A review of their forums indicates Amcrest has been promising updated software since last summer.  Doesnt look like theyve gotten around to delivering yet.

I get the impression that this NVR was designed to perform as part of a package including a few specific models of Amcrest cameras.  My guess is that it would probably perform relatively well in this regard.  Amcrest seems to have slapped in some limited support for other cameras (and when I say limited I mean ""view only"" support for even my Amcrest cameras!) and then sold it as a standalone unit.

The first major issue is a bit hard to explain if you don't know networking, but it illustrates my point as to why this unit performs so miserably as a standalone unit.  Basically what Im going to explain is this:  If you're dead set on this NVR, I recommend you get the Non-POE version (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amcrest-NV4108/dp/B01A7MPMNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amcrest NV4108</a>&nbsp;) and get yourself a POE switch (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BV-TECH-8-Port-120W-10-100Mbps-Power-over-Ethernet-Switch/dp/B005GAATOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BV-TECH 8 Port 120W 10/100Mbps Power over Ethernet Switch</a>&nbsp;) to run your POE cameras.  Youll save yourself a number of setup pains right out of the gate.

So heres why:  This unit basically creates its own little VIP Lounge within your existing home network for the cameras connected to it.  Think of your router as a bouncer at a night club.  Whenever a new network device shows up to the club, the router gives it an IP Address so it can talk to all of the other devices in the club.  So you plug the NVR in and it gets an IP Address from your router.  Cool, now it can talk to everyone else in the club.  Now you plug in some cameras to the NVR.  Rather than have the NVR go to the router and say, Hey, can I have some IP numbers for these cameras so they talk to everyone?  The NVR says, Hey bouncer, these cameras are going to be back in the VIP lounge with me  if you want to talk to them youve got to go through me.

Assuming you have one of the select few Amcrest cameras that the NVR _FULLY_ supports, this isn't too big a deal.  Youll be able to make any changes you need to the camera straight through the NVR.  Unfortunately, literally any other camera (including some of my Amcrest cameras!) are not supported in this manner.  Yes, I can view the video feeds just fine, but now I can no longer talk to my camera because the NVR is hiding it in the VIP lounge!  I cant access it to change even the most basic settings.  Cant change the time on it, cant change the overlay display settings, cant change the channel name.  Cant access it all.  There are a few ways around this all of which are time consuming and unnecessarily annoying.

Now what the NVR _OUGHT_ to allow is for a techy type person to go into the settings and tell the NVR, Hey! Quit trying to be your own bouncer in my club.  Ive already got a router, just do whatever it tells you to do!  For some unknown reason, Amcrest does not allow this option.  Mind boggling.  What I ended up doing to get around this was use a POE switch to run and power all of my cameras so that I can still talk to them on my network, and then the NVR finds the cameras on the switch.  So basically the POE function and switch function on the NVR  go entirely to waste because of this limitation in network administration on the NVR.

So I finally got around this and got everything talking to everything else satisfactorily.  Here are the issues Ive run into so far that have left me huffing and puffing:

The good and the bad:
**POE support (which is unfortunately crippled by network administration flaws)
**Remote access options from desktop and mobile (when they work)
**PTZ and full camera control directly from the interface (for an extremely limited number of supported cameras)
**Fairly decent tech support (though the guy initially refused to help me because I told him I wasn't comfortable giving him remote access to my network)
**High resolution viewing and recording (Though the Amazon listing and Amcrests website listing offer wildly conflicting information as to what is actually supported.  Also, be sure you research and understand the quality degradation in recording that occurs as you add more, higher resolution cameras potentially including step downs in frame rate and resolution).

The ugly:

-SIX CHARACTER PASSWORD LIMIT.  Are you stinking kidding me?  And this is supposed to be a home security product?
-Serious support limitations and annoyances.  Pretty much the only browser I could get to work is Internet Explorer and even then its shoddy.
-Web plugins are extremely outdated and rely on archaic plugin support as their backbone.  Ive had to pretty much turn off every security measure within Internet Explorer just to get them to work. Again, this is supposed to be a home security product and Im supposed to feel comfortable leaving it open for remote internet access???
-Web plugins are unstable.  Often ask me to install them on every other access of the unit even though Ive already installed them 30 times that same day.
-Cant change options on cameras including the most basic operations.  Cant put time overlays, cant change channel names, etc.
-General interface is cluttered and non-intuitive (most notably in playback mode)
-Remote access is extremely unstable.  None of the easy set up options worked for me and the advanced options are hit or miss.  We had our power go out last night and the NVR had to reboot.  I can access it fine locally and remotely from the Web app right now, but still cant get it back on the mobile app for absolutely no apparent reason.
-No manual included.  PDF manual is available from Armrests website, but even it is a technical mess (howd you guys manage to pull THAT off???).  First, the manual is just a generic Amcrest NVR manual and not specific to this model. Second, the manual appears to be a poorly-executed scan of a paper document  you literally cant even use the search function to navigate the PDF.  What on Earth?!

I was really stoked to add an NVR to my camera network.  Unfortunately while this one (like all Amcrest products do) attempts to bridge the gap between easy setup for the average user and decent options for the advanced user, it doesnt perform either task particularly well.  The POE and network switch functions are pretty much rendered useless given the network administration shortcomings, and the access options are limited, unstable, and annoying.  Frankly its left me wondering if I wouldnt be better off running Blue Iris or Zone Minder on my home server and ditching the NVR idea entirely.

Im seriously hoping Amcrests software engineers will step up and offer some extensive updates to the NVR firmware and remote access suites.

So I bought this little speaker about a week ago. So far it has been working surprisingly well for my need. I use it in a home gym and it does the job for a 30$ speaker. It obviously does not sound as well as other portable speakers I own like the Bose Sound dock or Beats Pill. The latter it can compete with though. Surprisingly it does get rather loud. Now do not expect this to have ground shaking sound. It probably would not be the best speaker to take to the beach with 10 of your friends. but maybe 3-5? I highly recommend purchasing this product!,0
This is a really nice looking leather belt. It has a smooth embossed finish that not only looks great but allows you to slide it on and off easily. I ordered a size 40 and the width and length measurements matched exactly as they are stated. The belt is very comfortable and looks much more expensive than it is for sure. It also come in a really nice box which makes it perfect for giving as a gift. I received a discount in exchange for an honest review. I definitely recommend this belt.,1
"As always, Santa Barbara Surfing company does not disappoint! This is an amazing mat and although I don't use it for wetsuit purposes, I do use it for my kids and husband when we go to the beach.

Additionally, I know that my car won't get sand, water or whatever else they've dragged along with them! It is easy to store, but more importantly, extremely easy to clean so that is always a plus in my books!

"One Star:  Got this in January 2016 and loved it up until today.  All of a sudden while removing my phone, it's like the spring broke and the clamp no longer works. I have a Droid Turbo 2 and a 2014 Honda Accord.  Never had a problem with the charger fitting into the cigarette lighter at an angle.

I thought it was made better than this so I can't recommend.

Updated June 30, 2016 to 4 stars on the mount and 5 stars on the company:  I was contacted by Alpatronix offering to ""turn your experience into a positive one.""  I provided photos of the broken clamp and immediately received free of charge and free shipping a replacement clip.

I had not registered the first car mount but the company contacted me to make it right.  I'm thrilled to have this car mount back in my car and I do recommend this and the company behind it.  Thank you, Alpatronix.",1
It very comfortable and seems to be made from high quality material which doesn't make it look like a cheap crop at all. It is somewhat a little bit big for me I normally wear XS small in american size clothing the ends of the crop top seems to be baggy or it might be just because I'm 5'4 thats why its kinda big in the ends for me. The material is kinda thick which I guess is good so that my undergarment inside won't be visible to the others! The package actually came in earlier than expected!!!

"Accuweight's AW-KS005WS Digital Food Scale is head and shoulders above my plain old school mechanical scale and is a welcome addition to the kitchen.

The scale is aesthetically pleasing and really adds class to the kitchen. I love the sleek design of the scale and the glass top.

I also love that this is digital and not another mechanical scale. I no longer have to look at my old hard-to-read scale dead on in order to get an accurate weight. All I need to do with this scale is put the food on the scale and I get an instant easy-to-read reading. The scale has four weight displays to choose from: pounds/ounces, grams, fluid ounces, and milliliters. Toggling through the four display options is as simple as pressing a button.

The most important thing about this digital scale is that it is accurate. I tested this with various items and compared the readings against my old manual scale. The results were spot on. I would weigh the item several times in a row and I would get the same reading each time so the readings are also consistent which is also important. One thing I should mention is that you need to have the scale on a hard level surface in order to get accurate readings. Also note that the scale is not for items that weigh more than 11 pounds.

I've been using this scale on a daily basis for the last week and have been really happy with it. If you are in the market for a new kitchen scale, I highly recommend checking out this one.

The scale is powered by 2 AAA batteries (included).

"This is a great product and saves a ton of time when you need to do pocket joinery. The ""kit"" comes with a high quality drill bit and a nice and long square tip for your drill. There are many different versions of Kreg jigs; this one is suitable for cabinetry work or to join 2x2s (or other pieces that do not exceed these dimensions.) Don't forget to buy the appropriate Kreg screws; this product comes with a sample of different sizes but you'll certainly need more. Check Kreg's website to determine the correct screw size, or read the small leaflet that comes with the product. Kreg products are expensive, but the ooze quality, from the Jig itself to the drill bit, and even the box they come in.

From time to time, there's a ""promo bundle"" of this product and a Kreg C-clamp for a few more dollars. Buy that bundle if you can find it, but keep in mind that any decent C clamp will do. I'd definitely recommend some kind of ""square angle"" jig when torquing the screws on the pieces, or they'll move and you'll end up with a crooked joint.",1

"Ordered and received this case immediately before a nice vacation, so I've been using this for almost 2 weeks now, feel I can give an honest review. I take great care of my phones, but prefer a case to protect the screen and camera lens, as well as give me a little grip for handling, especially a large phone like the v10.  The texture is just right to handle, but still allows me to slip it in my pocket with little issue. Also, the dual layer is nice, especially since it's not that tacky / sticky rubber like cheaper cases, this is actually had a really good feel to it.
No issues with NFC payments or the fingerprint scanner, so all good things.
One last note. I actually like how it lets me see a sliver of the metal sides of the phone,  cosmetically it looks good to my eye.
At this point, I prefer this over the Spigen case sitting at home.

"I wore this tunic top yesterday and it was so comfortable.  It is loose fitting so none of those bumps and bulges are apparent.  It is long enough to cover my butt and also make the torso look longer.  I received it in the Brilliant blue.  I received a lot of compliments on the top itself as well as the color.  Someone even asked me if I lost weight!

This pullover top has a silky knit finish.  The company suggested hand washing but I did machine wash it and it came out beautifully.  The top also does not wrinkle easily.  Because of this feature, I think this would be a nice tunic to pack in your luggage for a trip.

I wore it as a casual top and wore it with a silky light blue scarf.  But it could be dressed up for a night out on the town with the proper accessories.

One thing that I really like is that it is made in the USA.  So much of our factory work has been moved out of the states it is nice to see a garment at a reasonable price that is made in the United States.

This would make a nice gift for a plus size woman.  It comes in colors other than the one I received.  There are neutrals as well as some pastels and brighter colors.

I saw these boots online and fell in love with all the color choices!  I picked the pink quilted color in a size 12 and they fit really good!  I loved that this company actually made bigger sizes!  i have such big feet it is often hard to find a shoe that I like in my size.  i also have a wide calf and since these boots laced up the whole way I could easily adjust them so they fit perfectly!  i had never seen a shoe before with a secret pocket for your ID and money so i was so excited to wear these out!  I am not used to boots so I was not able to wear them all day yet (they go up about mid calf so after about 5 hours I had to take them off) but other than me not being used to the feel they were really comfy!  The zip pocket on the side of the boot works great too!  i was able to fit my ID and debit card along with some money in it with no issues!  The zipper is nice and tight so you don't have to worry about it coming down and loosing all your stuff!  All things considered I am super happy with this boot!  If you are questioning fit I would stick to whatever size you normally buy.  They are pretty true to fit if not a bit bigger than normal!

"I selected these shoes to test as a daily shoe for ""park to beach"" activity. I live in Hawaii so often we just decide to stop what we are doing and go play or we head out to a secluded beach that usually has a rocky path. The regular reef shoe doesn't support my arches so I tried these out. They are soft and bendable.The top of the shoe is made from breathable nylon and neoprene. The bottom sole also has a nice tread on it fit for water/trail hiking/reef shoe.  They slip on and have 2 sizing closures; a velcro heel strap and quick pull elastics for the width. I had no trouble putting them on. Inside, the shoes are soft and do not hurt my feet. Unfortunately, they do not fit as I had hoped. They ran larger than true size. First, I placed my foot on the shoebed. Without tightening either the elastics or the velcro, the insole fit fine and the arch was at the right place but the tops and heel were way too big. Then I cinched in the velcro heel closure and the elastics. Once I did that, my great toe was wedged into the toe box, my least toe snagged on the nylon at the top and the arch was about 1/2 inch too far back. I wear a size 9 shoe, I ordered size 9 and These initially fit like a 10. The shoes do appear to be durable and look like they would have been perfect had I purchased a different size. I followed the size guide to the letter.  I can't test them any further as far as use on a trail or the like because they are too big so I will be sending them back. I do recommend the shoes. I loosened them a bit and padded around the house in them for about an hour and they were really comfortable. They just kept slipping off. I do recommend the shoes, just make sure that you go down a size because, even though I was able to modify the top of the shoe to fit, it forced my foot into an incorrect placement over the arch that was not a good thing for me.

"I recently purchased these curtains for my son's bedroom and was very impressed with the quality! The fabric is a soft, almost silky material, and the print is absolutely adorable. I love the fact that they have grommets, which makes it so much easier to open and close. I would like to note that although they are marketed as ""blackout"", I would consider them more as ""light blocking"" as there is a very small amount of light that can filter through the curtain. They aren't backed with that white thick blackout material, it is more of one heavy weight fabric with a silver color on the back.  Thats also what makes them softer and less stiff. I had to hem them which was easy, and they look great! I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1
"This is a great deal. Not only does Bibber send you TWO bottles that mimic sunscreen, the bottles are huge. They also include a soft plastic flask, essentially a bag with a spout, to carry any other beverages you can think of. The only problem I see is that may be hard to clean because you can't open up the bottle and scrub inside, only wash it out with soapy water. Either way, this is pretty cool. You can stick the silver sticker on the end of the bottle and make it look like it has never been opened -- clever feature. I really dig these.",0
"I ordered this cup because i wanted a Yeti but didn't want to pay the high price of a Yeti. Needless to say i am very impressed! The cup came beautifully packaged so would make a nice gift for someone. The cup is light yet sturdy, the lis fits tight just like my husbands yeti. I love the stainless still finish & the clear lid that you can drink out of or put a straw in it. It's very durable as it has already been dropped a few times...oops! It's easy to wash & clean but not dishwasher safe :-(. So how does it hold up for keeping your drink cool? GREAT! Now don't get me wrong its no yeti but when compared to my husbands yeti it held its own. after a full 20 hours by husbands yeti has more ice than sovrano cup but hey that was 20 hours & if it keeps ice for a full day this girl is happy :-). Now compared to my tervis tumbler...get this cup it is WAY BETTER! I have posted a picture showing how much ice it had left in it after 20 hours & i refilled it with tea 3 times so like i said i am pretty impressed! I would definitely buy another one.

"I'm really please with this flashlight. I am sending my kid to camp and need a flashlight for them to take with them, and this fits the bill. It'd pleasantly solid. It has a good amount of heft to it, but easy to hold and use. It feel solid!

It also produces a good bright light and perfect to make your way in the dark.

I'm also happy that they provided instructions (I've included a picture for reference). I purchased a similar product without instructions and while it seems like a little thing, it actually makes a difference and it helps!

Lastly, what makes this flashlight stand apart, is that it includes the 18650 rechargeable battery along with a charger! How great is that! It also works with AAA batteries, but the fact that the rechargeable battery comes with it, and you don't have to purchase it separately, makes all the difference in the world! A really nice addition and I'm glad the folks at outlite include it.

A couple of small negatives; 1) the box came slightly damaged. Not a deal breaker by any means, just a little bent. Might have happened during shipping, I don't know and 2) they include a small keychain type flashlight, which isn't working. Again, not a deal breaker, since I didn't buy the flashlight expecting (or even wanting) they keychain flashlight, but would have been nice if it worked properly. Note, the instructions included don't mention anything about the keychain light.

I have included a photo of what's included so you can see what's in the box. Overall, I'm really pleased with this, and would recommend. It's solid, produces a good light, and best of all...it includes the rechargeable battery and charger! What's not to like!

"Im of the mindset that you should always have a variety of adapters for just in case scenarios.  So even though I didn't really have a use for this right now, I had the opportunity to get one of these on the house for the purposes of review, I gladly took it.

The 11N 150Mbps adaptor is very no-frills.  The tiny plastic body is plain, glossy black with the model number etched in the side of it.  The black is actually translucent so the green and red status LEDs can show through.  The configuration utility software packaged with the adapter is also no-nonsense, though I would have preferred if it were easier to bypass that software and just use Windows network settings to select this as the default network adapter.  Using Windows 10 it doesnt seem to be plug and play.

Connection speed seems a little iffy when tested against my laptops Atheros AR9285 adaptor which is the same 802.11 spec as this adapter (b/g/n).  Both were tested on my home network using a Verizon-branded Actiontec MI424WR.  I tested both 3 times consecutively using Googles speed test.  The card on my laptop measured an average of 21.3 Mbps down and 11.5 up.  The Rosewill USB adapter measured 15.7 down and 10.2 up.  Thats a pretty significant difference.

In a tight spot this is a great quick and dirty wireless solution, especially if you're using it for low bandwidth applications.  Otherwise the performance of this adapter is a little inconsistent for my liking.

"This set contains 3 filled cubes and 3 envelopes - cubes for packing clothes and such, and envelopes for laundry bags. I have found these to be great for traveling - I am able to keep all my items stored much more neatly and more organized,and since everything compresses better I am able to carry more stuff in my duffle bag. The material is waterproof and dustproof, so no worries about rain getting your clothes wet when traveling. Theyre easy to wash as well. The material is lightweight, but once they are filled with clothes seem plenty sturdy. My only real criticism is the design of the bags - I would have preferred a more simple, toned down look instead of the flashy polka dots and bright lettering. Perhaps make some simple black and navy blue versions for men! Aside from that I am happy with this purchase.

My review score philosophy:
As a longtime Amazon customer, I depend on the honest reviews of other users. I do my best to provide insightful and unbiased reviews that may help others decide whether to purchase or pass on an item that they are interested in.

I purchase a ton of items through Amazon; some I receive for free, some I get at a discount, and others I pay full price for. I will always disclose if I receive an item for free or at a discounted rate. I write a lot of reviews, so here is a breakdown on how I arrive at a final star rating for a product:

5 stars  Incredible! This is an amazing product that performed above and beyond my expectations. Highly recommended!

4 stars  I like it, but there are a few flaws. However, the product functions as described for the most part, and is still highly recommended for those interested in it.

3 stars - Okay. Works pretty well, but I was a little disappointed in some aspects, or certain functions did not work properly/ as described.

2 stars  While there are worse products out there, there are also far better choices for your money.

1 star  I dislike the product. Severely flawed in design or functionality, and not recommended for purchase.",1

"I really like these headphones a lot.  When I received them in the mail, I really didn't know what to expect. But when I opened the outside package and seen the packaging for the headphones, I figured I was in for something special. The actual packaging for the headphones is very nice. Almost fancy. They come with a charging cord, and they also come with the cord to let you listen to music even if the battery is dead in the headphones. The first time I tried on the headphones, they fit comfortably on my ears. They don't cover the entire ear, like I thought they would for the noise cancelling option. But they're very comfortable. I bought mine about a week and a half ago, but I wanted to use them before I actually did a review for them. So today I mower my yard on a riding lawn mower and used the headphones while riding the mower and cutting the yard. I turned the headphones on and then tried starting my mower to see if I could hear the mower starting. I didn't hear it at all. After the mower was running and I took it out of the garage, I used the headphones to see if I could hear the mower mowing. Again, I could not hear the mower running or mowing. Then I tested the noise cancelling option. I've never had a pair of headphones that have noise cancelling option so I wasn't sure what to expect. I turned the noise cancelling option on, and then turned it off again, trying to figure out the difference. The only difference I could tell, was when you have the noise cancelling option on, the music gets a little louder. Like I said, I don't know if thats exactly what its supposed to do, but thats what it seemed to do for me. But either way, with or without the noise cancelling option on, I couldn't hear the mower that I was sitting on mowing the lawn. It took me about 2 hours to mow the entire yard, and the battery life showed no signs of getting low. Another thing is, I received a phone call while using these headphones and they worked great for calls. I could hear the person I was talking to better than I could if I was talking to them on the phone regularly. And they could hear me pretty good also. I really like these headphones. They look and sound great. I've never had a really expensive pair of headphones, but for the money, these headphones work and sound really good. I would definitely recommend these headphones to anyone who asked. I'm really happy with the product.  The only problem I had with them is initially syncing the phone and the headphones with Bluetooth.  I just didn't hold the button long enough to let it sync.  I had held the button only long enough to turn the headphones on, and you have to hold the button longer than that.
But I emailed the seller about it and they helped me a lot.  And let me tell you this about the seller.  The seller of these headphones are really great. Before I even received the headphones they sent me an email telling me exactly how to set up the Bluetooth on the headphones to sync with your phone. Well dummy me, didn't completely understand the email, and I couldn't get the phone and the Headphones to sync with Blue tooth. So I wrote the seller and told them what I was doing and if they could be of any help. They sent me an email back with in a couple hours and told me what I was doing wrong and how to get the headphones and phone to sync. To me thats really great sellers. To go out of their way to answer their emails like that. And I'm sure I'm not the only email they had to answer.

"I have been going through many of the double walled vacuum tumblers to see how they compare to the original trendsetter which is the Yeti tumbler.  The Irico tumbler is a good looking tumbler but looks aren't where the ""rubber meets the road"" so to speak.  I really like the indentions on the lower portion of the tumbler which help to increase the ability to hold on to the tumbler.  The size and shape are comparable to all other tumblers in this category.  The Irico is much lighter than the Yeti, RTic, Ozark Trail, Simple Modern, or any other of the myriad of tumblers available.  I believe that this lends to this tumbler just being average.  I have performed the tell all ice test on this tumbler for each of the past two days and it does not hold up against other tumblers.  I filled the tumbler with ice and water, set it on the counter overnight, and checked it out the following morning.  After a 12 hour sit time, there was very little ice left in the tumbler.  This is definitely not on par with all the competition that is out there.  My Ozark will hold ice and water without the ice melting for close to 30 hours.  My Simple Modern will hold ice and water without melting for almost 36 hours consistently.  I do realize that no one is going to have a tumbler of water sitting around that long without drinking it, but when you are in this category, the product better match up to the big boys.  The snap shut lid does not keep water from leaking out.  I can close the lid and still drink out of the tumbler.  I definitely do not like the lid.

"These shoes look really awesome and are made of great quality material. The color is as shown. However, the peep toe is rather large and I find my toes popping out more than I would like. Also, when they arrived my right shoe was bigger than the left.... It felt as if someone had tried it on and stretched it out. I have yet to wear them for a full day, but despite these flaws I still think these shoes are awesome. I can only hope they wear well.",0
Great! everything went well.,0
"The color is just as pictured. In my opinion, it is such a beautiful and shiny blue and so pleasant to wear and glance at. The metal is thick and strong and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. What a great ring to have for the price, definitely pleased. It also appears unisex, so anybody can have one.

"I ordered this case in the teal color in the pattern damask. This case came in a nice black box, which makes it look fancier than most of the other iPhone cases I have bought from amazon that just came in a clear bag. It also came with a film on the inside of the case that you will have to peel off, and usually they are really difficult to remove. But this film went over the camera hole, so you can just push your finger through the back of the phone where the camera hole is and it will push the film up so you can peel it off. $5.99 is an incredible price for an iPhone 6 case and I loved the design so I bought it. The base color of the case is sort of like a frosted glass but a smooth surface. So you can sort of see your iPhone's color through the case, but your apple logo will be covered by the design. I would probably describe the color as more of a sea green or mint rather than a teal, but the color is nice. It is overall a hard case, but the sides have a little flexibility which makes it easier for me to put my iPhone in and take it out. On all four corners of the back of the case there are super small elevated platforms that help keep the back of the case slightly elevated from a surface to help the back of your case from getting too dirty. The buttons are easy to push on the sides of the phone and I don't have any problems with my iPhone's ports on the bottom or microphone or speakers. The edges of the case also come up over my screen  a little bit. Overall I think this case is amazing and for the low price of $5.99 I think you are missing out if you don't get it.

"Great compact on the go power bank. With 4400mAh you can charge you phone more than 6 times and never run out on batterie when you more need it ! Really easy to use,just conect,press and wait to have that fast juice again. This works amazing for me with my Gopro and is very handy for the timelapses ! even if you got an rechargable Mod Box (vaporizar or electronic cigarette) you can charge it and don't need to arrive home and charge it to keep that anxietycalm ! It charge in less than 2hrs been fully discharged,so is a pretty conciderable fast charge compared to other less mAh power banks. If you are familiarized with the 18650 batteries you know that this batteries give you a looooong charge life and this ones that are inside the zilu smart power bank are Top grade class A 18650 batteries,they give Strong emphasis on safety through the ""UL 1624""certification,that is  the most rigorous safety test in the industry ! some charge times and ammount on latelly devices are : iPhones can be charged almost 7 times(test it with an iphone 6s plus), Samsung Galaxy S6 3 times, Galaxy Note 5 nearly 2 times and 1/2, iPad Pro almost 2 times and it produce very Low heat compared to even smallers power banks with less mAh.

"We have been looking for a phone holder for the car for quite some time. The previous holder that we had been using simply suction cupped to the windshield and the back of the phone stuck to a plastic plate on the holder. The unit was not great from the beginning- it blocked a portion of the driver's sight lines, the unit would often come off the windshield because the suction cup was no longer sticking or the phone itself would fall off the plastic plate (usually while driving which was super dangerous!) We knew we needed a holder that would avoid all of these pitfalls.
We took our time deciding between the units that attached to either the air vent or mounted to the CD player. We decided to go with this unit for a number of reasons. We thought it would be less obtrusive for the driver's sight lines and we also did not want it to potentially block the air vents in the car. We do not use the CD player all that much anymore and thought that we would be okay with this type of mount. We were correct! The unit was easy to assemble and easy to install. Just a click into the CD player slot was all it took. It fits very snugly into the CD player which was a relief. We were glad to know that the unit would be secure. We even bumped along some rough road for a while and the unit stayed snug in the CD player and the phone did not come loose at all.

The main problem that we have had with the unit is the knob on the back which tightens the swiveled mount. This knob doesn't always catch and tighten snug. When you crank to tighten down, the knob does not always catch the threads well and in turn the phone ball mount stays loose. If you are able to tighten down the swivel mount, you have a great unit. You just need to be cautious of this and take your time.

Overall we are quite pleased with this cell phone holder for the car. It has improved our sight lines and safety on the road and has kept our precious phones safe from dropping and from harm as well.

"My husband loves this. He puts it on his head or hat to look in any dark spot for something or when working on his projects etc. This way instead of having to hold a flashlight in one hand.

"Let me preface this review with I have not received any discounting or promotion on this product.  This is an honest consumer review.  I did a head-to-head comparison of two brand-new 10 ounce lowball stainless steel cups; one from YETI and the other from RTIC.  I took two, 2 1/2 inch ice balls that were frozen at the same time with the same water source.  Both cups were at room temperature and each ice ball was placed in each cup at the same time. I am very please to state that the RTIC and YETI  were comparable to the point that any differences in ice keeping ability is negligible. In fact the RTIC  kept the cube for approximately 45 minutes longer than the YETI. Both cups kept ice past 16 hours. Some product observations, the yeti is heavier but only slightly. I was impressed with the RTIC lid, it fit tighter out of the box than did the YETI lid.  I wasn't allowed to post my previous review in regards to pricing of the products. So I will not go into that at this point other than to say do your research. I was able to get the RTIC cup for half via the company site.  I also wanted to state that the RTIC  comes with a lid while the YETI does not.",1

I love this robe! It fits great. I'm a size 16/18 on the bottom. There is plenty of robe to go around and close. The pink is not see through.,0
I love this case. The case fits very well and is lightweight. It is very easy to install. It does not cover up any of the edge screen which i found to be a problem with some other cases really like that the colors are really vivid. I've even dropped my phone down some concrete steps and there was no damage to my phone or the case. Very durable. I would recommend this case to anyone. Disclosure I received this case free.,1

"This is an excellent soldering iron kit. I have many uses for my soldering kit, but the most recent was when my son accidentally dropped his favorite lantern, and knocked a wire out of its proper place. I picked this kit because it contained everything that I needed to get the job done. I was able to easily fix my sons lantern, and all was right in the world in his eyes, haha! The handle is comfortable to hold while working, and it does not get too hot. I like the on/off switch function that it comes with. The anti-static tweezers that it comes with are also very useful. They really came in handy when I was working on my project. The product comes with a user manual to guide you if you are not familiar with how to use a soldering iron. One of my favorite features is that it comes with a carrying case that you can store all of your supplies in when the product is not being used. I have a full garage, and it is nice when they have premade storage containers that nicely keep all of the items together in one spot. Overall I was very pleased with this product. It is a good quality soldering iron, and I would recommend it to others. You never know when you will be in need of one, so I think it is great to have one on hand!

"This is a really solid pan. The weight of the pan is heavy and the non-stick coating works excellently. I like the heavy riveted handle. Unlike some pans that have this look, the handle is solid throughout. The base of the pan has an extra layer of metal that keeps the pan nice and flat on the burners. I can't comment on its induction capability because my stove does not have induction burners.

One of the things I couldn't tell from the photos online is how the edges are. The pan has a non-stick coating that goes up and over the edge of the pan allowing easy release of food when tilting the pan to the side. This can cook eggs and pancakes without any kind of oil or spray.

I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review, but I would have been happy paying full price for this pan--it works easily as well as any of my other higher-end non-stick pans.",1

"This is a typical USB cable. I like the length of it for most applications. It fit well into my device, charged it normally, and seems to be made of high quality materials. I constantly plug and unplug my device so it will be interesting to see how this cable lasts over time. I find that I am unable to get this to show on my phone as quick charging, but believe that the cable works as well as the quick charge that came with my HTC 10 phone. It definitely charges at a faster rate of speed than does another cable that I had purchased that specifically stated that it supported fast charging. If you're looking for what appears to be a high quality cable and is long enough to reach most outlets, but not too long to get tangled up with other wires, I definitely recommend giving this Choetech product a look.

"Love it. Perfect. Does the trick! I was concerned that the belt would rise up my waist when I run (because I am a string bean skinny guy), but it does a really good job staying in place.

Better then expected!
At first I thought I may have to return these steps, my little yorkie wanted no part of them. I tried and tried and left the steps next to the couch, but with no avail. She was just afraid of them. They did seem a little narrow, even though she is only 2 pounds, I felt she may fall off them. But I decided I was going to give them a try and not give up so easy. I kept putting her on the third step to climb up to the couch, and then would put her on the third and so forth...you get the drift...same with going down...well one day she finally went up by herself...she just wanted to get on the couch and I wasn't picking her up...going down was another story...moving the steps between the bedroom to the living room, she finally started going down in the bedroom...now I'm going to get another set for the bedroom...wish they came in another color, or were just more fashionable..guess I could dress them up myself, I'm a crafter!!!lol",0
"These tools are amazing! I was a DeWalt man and never thought I would get anything else with tools. But when I saw that these were cheaper than the DeWalts, and after reading the reviews, I finally caved in and bought them. The worst that could happen is that I don't like them and send them back for a refund. Man was I wrong about Makita! The batteries last quite a long time and they don't die down when they're low on battery, they'll keep going until they're COMPLETELY dead! Fits nice in my hand, and has a collar around the tip that will glow in the dark! I definitely recommend these to anybody that doesn't want to pay more just for the brand.",0

"We were looking for a nice way to label a lot of our dry goods that we have (rice,snacks flour etc).  These labels are a nice size and adhere cleanly to the jars we have.  We don't have all glass jars which I was a little worried about, but all of them adhered well to the plastic containers as well as the glass ones.  The liquid chalk marker that came with it is nice as well, but the tip is way too broad for the size of these labels.  It did come off cleanly with just a little water.  We also did find it much easier to write on the label before placing it on the jar, which is counter to the instructions.

"It covers the entire screen, even the curved part.  It looks good on the phone, but this one like a lot of the other full screen covers has the appearance of a grid at times. It also only sticks around the edges. It is a good cover for the curved screens on the newer phones, but it comes down to preference. Most of the glass screen covers do not cover the entire screen, and a lot of the softer ones peel off around the edges. This is solid cover if you were looking for full screen protection. I did receive this one at a discount for an honest review.",1
"This is a high-quality product. The stainless steel is flawless and doesn't have any logos or writing on it, which I like. The heavy-duty plastic lid slides into place firmly with a rubber (I think silicone) gasket. There are no sliding or moving parts in the lid to make it difficult to clean.

The lip is a good size to drink from both with and without the lid. There is a tab at the back of the lid that provides an easy visual cue for which way to align it while drinking.

This keeps drinks hot or cold for a very long time. I keep it at my desk and refill it about twice a day. There isn't much of a difference between the temperature when I fill it to the temperature three hours later.

I tested this by filling it with a tray full of ice cubes (it's 20oz, so it took all of them!) and leaving it out overnight with the lid on in our 78-degree kitchen. See the photos below. Only about 2 oz of ice melted in 9 hours. I also filled it with boiling hot water to feel for warm spots, but only found one that was a little warmer than the rest.

I wish I could put this in the dishwasher, but the instructions say not to and I don't want to ruin it. I don't have very big hands, and it is a little bigger than I prefer. I've seen a bunch of handles for these on Amazon and I'm considering buying one.

I received this cup for free in exchange for my honest review. It's a good product, and I would recommend it to my friends and family, especially since it's quite a bit less expensive than the bigger-name products.

Love my new fitbit cover! Very stylish and comfortable! I like having the actual buckle so it can't catch and fall off so easily.

"These lights look great and are the perfect size for our small deck. My only real complaint is that they don't ""remember"" their previous setting. Every night when they come on, they seem to choose a random light pattern. I bought two strings and most nights only one of the strands actually turns on. Switching the lights off and then on always fixes the problem but I bought them thinking they would be a one time setup deal and it's turned out to be a manual process almost on a nightly basis.",0
"This speaker's sound is clear and crisp.  I am impressed by the audibility of this device!  The set up was incredibly simple on an iPhone 6.  All you need to do is enable bluetooth, select the speaker and done!  The volume level can be controlled either from your phone or the speaker itself.

"This stainless steel salt and pepper are exactly what I was looking for. They were packaged very well as not to be damaged during transit. The container itself which holds the salt or pepper is made of glass giving it a high quality look and feel. The stainless steel grinder also feels like its made from quality and not just cheap plastic. They came apart very easily to be cleaned and are also super easy to fill as compared to other pepper mills where it has a rod that runs all the way through its base making it difficult to pour the salt or pepper in. These however, the whole grinder unit itself comes off and you are left with just the base and a nice wide opening on top to pour the contents in. Once filled I was delighted to see that these actually grinded the pepper and sea salt with extreme ease. It didn't struggle at all where extra effort was needed to continue the grind. It also has a nice dial where you can adjust the size of granuals desired. Overall I am very impressed with these mills they are of higher quality and work better then a set that I had purchased for nearly twice the price at a high end kitchen store. I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a nice set.

"I ordered this case for my daughter because she swears she's a hippie and I thought the colors were groovy.
I was a little skeptical about what it can handle because my daughter drops her phone frequently and allows her two year old daughter to play with it. Well, I'm happy to announce that she loves it and put it in her phone the minute it came in. Do it passed that test, and it is very durable. She still drops it and lends it to her daughter and it has withstood those beatings so I am no longer skeptical. It's tough!

This is by no means ""bragging"" but informing the reader of why I'm reviewing a certain product. ABOUT ME: I am an elementary school counselor and am always looking things to use with my students, in lessons, or at school. As a counselor, I am very drawn to relaxation ideas, techniques, and gadgets. Music, stress relievers, massage .tools, you name it! I love them all! I am a 45 year old Mexican woman who has been happily married for 25 years. I'm about 5'4 and weigh more than I would like to. I've never liked exercising but my husband loves running and has even run a marathon. Recently, we realized that getting fit is no longer an option if we want to grow old together and be agile, so we decided to turn one of our bedrooms into a yoga/exercise room. We have an eight year old cockapoo who tends to gain weight rather easily. One of my greatest and newest passions is gardening! I'm having a hard time this year starting from seeds but last year they did beautifully! My husband is an avid gardener and landscaping artist, so I'm the newbie. We live in the desert, So water is scarce and going green necessary.

"This bathing suit is made to replicate the vintage style with a halter top tie around the neck. It contains a special material to hold in your tummy so it appears flatter. It also has a strap that hooks behind the shoulder blades that gives you more support for holding your front up. The bra cups each have a pad and allows you to push up and show some cleavage.
I got the mint color that looks mostly like a mint teal color. It is beautiful! The leg openings in the front come down more on the front legs and the back side covers you well. This is an one piece and is very flattering when on you. It does runs small so get the next size up.
The Adfolf one piece Monokini suit is 87% polyester and 13% spandex. It pulls on, ties at the neck, and hooks in the back. This halter top style permits you to adjust the length of the torsos to fit you best. The way the fabric folds across you permits stretch and holds you firmly in place. I especially like the halter style with the hooked section to give me more support. I also prefer the legs to come down and cover more rather than coming up high on your side. The back covers you well.
I washed it in the machine to get the chlorine out, but air dry it. It dries quickly leaving you less time to wait to get in back into your swimsuit. The ruching in the front helps to hide flaws as well.
I love the overall vintage look in the style that was chosen to create this suit. The color is uplifting and calming at the same time. I will enjoy this bathing suit for a long time. Please make note it does run small so order the next size up for a proper fit.
I received this vintage style bathing suit for free for my review, however, my opinion is my own and unbiased.",1

"I lived overseas for many years where dash cams have been a necessity.  Therefore, this is the fourth one I have had (I returned one as soon as I tried it as the video was horrible). I am a value shopper, so none of them were expensive high-end models.  I bought this one after returning to the US.  The three best features of this camera are the video, the user manual and the ease of use.  The video is very good quality both in daylight and at night.  Best of all, it is super wide angle.  I like that it records more peripheral activity that could be important when documenting an event (something I luckily have never had to do).  The user manual is well organized and clear.  Everything is spelled-out, no need to guess what (often) missing steps might be.  The controls are logical and easy to use.  The sound is OK.  What I don't like most is the big chrome ring around the lens and the chrome around the sides of the body.  It does look nice, but it makes the camera super visible from the outside.  I prefer to be more discrete and covered the chrome with black electrical tape.  You can still see the camera, but a bit less so.  The mount is pretty standard for these things-a suction cup that attaches to the windshield.  It fell off once in 106F heat, but otherwise holds well.  I wish these things came with a clip that would attach to the headliner; it would be smaller and the camera would be higher up.  Also, the battery life is very short, essentially useless. The fit and finish are all very good.  All things considered I like this dash cam and would buy it again.",0
"Got these cubes to pack for my sons trip to Disney. They turned out great, the sizes were perfect for us and kept his clothes nice and neat. I packed each cube with clothes for one specific day. It helped him stay organized and know what to wear for that specific day. I totally recommend these packing cubes.",0
"I purchased these for my little guy to take them to the beach next week.  They haven't been tested in the water yet or for a long period of time, but they were super easy to put on, made him smile, and he had no problem walking around the house with them on.

I got these because my little guy has fat feet and I dreaded the thought of squeezing his St. Bernard paws into regular water shoes.  I'm not a fan of the molded toe look but these have a velcro strap at the ankle that open up the access to a nice wide space to put chubby toddler feet in.

If I find that these have major down sides while in real use on the beach, I'll let you know.",0
"I'll start by saying that for the price, I was expecting nothing out of this but compared to the Samsung wireless charger, I actually like this better.  This charger is really slim and sleek. It just works too. I use it to charge my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.  This is not a fast charger but I use it overnight and my battery is charged in the morning.

Once you've put your phone in the correct spot (center on pad) the pad lights up blue and flashes about every 2 seconds.  If I wasn't a deep sleeper I would knock a star off as it lights up the room when it flashes.  I just tucked it under the bed in the interim.

It's nice being able to pick your phone up instead of unplugging it when you want to check something. Definitely impressed with this little guy and may buy another just keep on hand.

I did not receive this item discounted or free.",1
"This measuring spoon set is great.
I am surprised at how heavy they are, pleasantly surprised I should add.
After many many years searching through drawers in the kitchen for each measuring spoon we needed as we were baking and cooking, it is so nice having all of the measuring spoons together in one drawer, and in one spot in the drawer !!
I am very impressed with the heaviness of the stainless steel, it makes for a high quality product.
They are held together with an equally sturdy ring, no accidentally unhooking one of them that would end up getting lost somewhere in the drawer.
They arrived in a nice pouch.
I washed them right after receiving them so we could start using them right away !

Usually I'm pretty conservative when it comes to style and fads, but these are actually cute. They're not overly huge or obtrusive. I love the mirrored lenses. Anyone looking at you can't see through them and I like the colored tint. The frame is very thin and lightweight. I actually prefer that as I get migraines easily if thing are too heavy on my head. This is like wearing nothing. They do actually help block out the sun so they serve a purpose but since they're thin, I wouldn't recommend them for every day. The only reason for four stars instead of five is quality. I don't see them really lasting a long time because they're delicate. You have to be gentle with them. I can't just toss them into my purse. They bend easily and you would really need a sunglasses case to keep them safe. Overall, they are definitely nice and adorable, just at an okay quality.

"Im happy to replace my old blue plastic funnel with this HOXHA stainless steel funnel for several reasons.  First of all, I love its unique design with the option of using a screen.  This is the first Ive seen of a funnel with a screen and Ive already used it!  The screen is very easy to slide in and out of the funnel.  The funnel also has a update look and its stainless steel matches other appliances in my kitchen including the dishwasher that I put this funnel into for easy cleaning. The pictures and measurements that are included with the product description are accurate.  Im including a picture of the heart-shaped bottom of the funnel since it is different from the typical circle shape most funnels have.  Bottom line, Im very pleased with this funnel and the option of using its well-designed screen. This HOXHA stainless steel funnel was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I hope youve found this review helpful.",1

"This is exactly what I needed to repair the broken glass on my LG Optimus Pro.
  The reviewers who are complaining that the screen didn't last long or they had issues with it have apparently ordered the cheapest option from China, and you get what you pay for.

I made the repair on my own, no issues at all. I got everything I needed to swap out the glass/digitizer. It looks and works like a brand new phone now.
 The only complaint I could make is about the tools sent with it. The pry tools are poor quality, but they did the job.",0
"This hammock is light weight and very compact.  However, it is heavy enough that it is not something I would carry with me on all my hikes.
It is great though for camping, for even for using at the park!
It comes in its own storage bag with a draw string and plastic lock which is attached to the hammock.  You can use this storage bag when the hammock is set up to store your phone, water bottle, etc.  You get carabiners and the rope already attached, as well as extra rope for extending or tying around the trees.

The orange color is very bright and would signal if you were lost, so that is a great added bonus.

"This review is for Cotton Bath Towel Set Black - 8 Piece includes 2 Bath Towels, 2 Hand Towels, and 4 Washcloths by Utopia Towels

This product was delivered quickly and with good packaging.

This is a quality set of towels that you will not be embarrassed to leave for your guests.

The quality of the towels seems high, 100% cotton, decent thickness and no damage or loose threads.

The color is true to the picture and is solid throughout the towel.

They are not quite as thick as some of the other towels that we have so I am unsure how they will last after several washes but I will be sure to update this review if I experience any real issues.

I am happy with this set of towels and believe them to be good value at the retail price on amazon.

When one of his wheels broke the systems check worked to identify the problem and the customer service in getting him fixed was extraordinary.

If he was slightly shorter I think he would have less trouble getting stuck under cabinets etc.",0

I purchased this thinking I would use it with my charcoal grill but most of the time it falls off when you bump it.  In theory it sounds great keeping everything together.

"I ordered this cute, fluffy Natural Furry Raccoon Fur Pom Pom to use on my keychain because I always seem to be misplacing my keys.  It is a full 6"" in diameter and is extremely soft and fuzzy.  Although it is rather large in size, it can easily scrunch down and fit inside a closed fist (for comparison) if it is needed to fit inside a smaller space for storage.  It does not have any offensive odor and it does not shed.  Even when my cat tries to steal it away to play with it, I can always find it easily :)  The pom pom is attached to a sturdy key ring that has a removable clasp. The overall keyring clasp component is more decorative than sincerely heavy duty, but is suitable for normal wear.
I have been very satisfied with this purchase and will use it often.  When it arrived in the mailing envelope, I was not expecting too much, but when the package was opened and the pom pom was shook out a few times, it quickly obtained its round, fuzzy shape and has stayed that way ever since.

"I have three Dachshunds and am always looking for new toys to entertain them with. The size of the ball was a perfect size for their mouths. The color and texture of the ball was nice as well. I filled the ball with some of their food and threw it on the ground to see what they would do. One of my dogs, the one who LOVES toys, took it first and rolled it around a bit when he noticed there was food inside. He then took it to a corner in the house and proceeded to lick into the hole to try to get the food out. I took it away from him and gave it to another one of my dogs. He happily took it, chewed on it a bit, then also proceeded to lick into it to get the food out. My third dog is not much of a toy fan, I gave it to him and he seemed to enjoy chewing on it for a bit. At this point, I froze it, but the dogs didn't seem to care much. Unfortunately, my dogs did not play with it as it was intended to be. They just wanted to lick & chew into the holes. They did eventually bite off the flaps on the sides that hold the food inside. So, it didn't last more than a day in my house. But that is something typical in my house. The toy overall is strong, but if you have dogs that don't like the challenge of getting the food out, they could bite off the side flaps just as mine did. Unfortunately, another toy bit the dust in my household. I do like how the toy can be frozen, it can definitely come in handy on hot days. Even though the flaps are bitten off, one of my dogs still shows interest in playing with the toy, that I'm glad about.

"Like most people, I take my phone everywhere, including the pool and the beach.  I wanted a case that would protect my phone in any environment, and this case works well.  It fits my phone perfectly, and I still have access to all the functions.  It seems like the case will keep out sand, dust, and even water, though I must admit that I have not tried submerging my phone to test the case.  I don't intend to intentionally use the phone underwater; I just want it protected if it falls in the sand or water.  I am satisfied that this case will do the job.

"I received the Fasoar Unisex Knee High Stripe Football Sports Tube Socks 2 Pack with a pair of black and a pair of red in the pack. I ordered a large in size for my husband and he wears a 10 to 10.5 in shoes.

The Fasoar  socks fit great and hold. I ordered the for him because while he is at work his socks always ride down and he is constantly having to stop and pull them up.

Once he put the knee high socks on I knew immediately that they were going to be different than his other socks. These socks fit snug above the calf to keep them up and keep from falling down. So he don't have to worry about pulling  his socks all day!

Once he wore the black socks to work he came in and was just going on and on about how comfortable his socks are and how good they stayed up. They never worked there way down once during the whole work day. He works in concrete work so he is constantly moving and never slows down.

I tried them on and they felt great! More comfortable than wearing normal everyday socks. I wear an 8 to 8.5 size in shoes and the large fit me but loose they wasn't stretched all the way out in the foot area.

If my husband is comfortable at work and happy when he comes in then it definitely makes for a much better day for all of us!! Happy husband equals happy family!

However they are thin and I don't see the them lasting as much as my husband wears them, that is why I am giving four stars and not five. If they had been thicker it would have been five all the way because that is the only downside is the thinness. But they absolutely hold there shape and once washed they look like they did when you got them.

I recommend these socks to you even if you will be wearing them around the house they are just that comfortable. I received these socks at no charge/free to test them and try them out in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion/review of the Fasoar Unisex Knee High Stripe Football Sports Tube Socks 2 Pack with a pair of black and a pair of red in the pack.",1
"I just bought this vacuum but I will be returning it. The suction is good and if you only have hard wood floors, but if you have area rugs and/or carpet there is NO power assistance and it's hard work to push and pull the vacuum head to and fro.

They do not make her sweat at night and she washed them several times and they did not wrinkle at all. I slept on them also and i loved them.  This Empyrean bedding is made of 100% super soft brushed micro fiber fabric that is wonderful.  I will be ordering more for the rest of my beds in my house.  I have over several years have had trouble and spent lots of time and money trying to find good quality sheets and these seem to be the ones have been looking for.  Will recommend these to everyone.

This ring is both White Gold plated and Black Gold plated. The bottom half of the band is Silver toned and the top is Black toned. This makes for a very unique and different design. This would actually be great for people who have issues with Black plating peeling off too quickly. It usually starts to happen along the bottom of the band. That would not happen with this ring design. When you wear the ring you can't really even see the Silver because the Black plating part goes half way down the band to where your other fingers are. From the top it just looks like a Black plated ring.

The main crystal on this ring is a nice Black round cut Cubic Zirconia. It is about 8.5 mm in size which is great because it is not too small. I love how the sides of the band crisscross each other. On there the little crystals are clear. Even under the Black crystal there is a groove with some little clear crystals there also.

I got this ring in Size 7 and it fits like it should. It is beautiful and adds a nice touch of elegance. I think it is a very pretty and unique two toned ring.

"This is a very pretty curtain. Keep in mind that it's for *one* panel only. We have a wall that divides two large rooms of our house and it has a glass door. It's nice to have that visibility, but we also like to have a sheer curtain up. I accidentally ordered the wrong size so we're going to have to him this, but it's really nice and I can't wait to get it in the right spot in our house. The curtain is a nice sheer white with butterfly and swirl details. Some of the butterflies are embroidered with red and flecks of silver. The embroidery is quite plush and gives the curtains some depth. The metal grommets at the top are large and can accomodate a variety of rods. I think that I would actually like it a little more of some of the details were offset instead of in a line, but it does look exactly like the picture so I can't fault it for that! I received this panel at a discount in exchange for my completely honest review.",1

"Tl;dr: Awesome decent quality shirt, feels great and looks great. True to picture and true to size. Definitely worth the buy.

I bought this shirt because what guy doesn't need more classic button down shirts?

When I was given the opportunity to receive this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review, I had to add this gem to my collection.

I was skeptical about the fit of this shirt, since it is slim fit. I am a small guy at 5'3"" 145lbs, so finding button down shirts that fit are sometimes a challenge. I usually wear a medium but I can fit into a small. I decided to go with medium on this shirt and it fits perfectly.

When I opened the package, I could immediately tell it was a decent quality shirt. It looks even better than the stock photos on Amazon.

It fits true to size, if you are short like me it will be a little long untucked. I tuck it in and roll the sleeves. It looks classy and great!

I definitely recommend buying this shirt it really does fit true to size and looks even better than the photo.

Sorry for the crease in the pictures, I put it on right out of the package.",1
"The reason I ordered the shoes was I thought they were really cute. When I got the shoes yesterday, I was so happy to see that they are top quality shoes. They aren't cheaply looking at all. They are a leather upper with a rubber sole bottom. They even smell like leather. The bow on top is sewed on and not glued down. They would work with both a dressy and casual outfit. The shoes are really nice and they work with my wide feet. I would definitely recommend them to others. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.",1
"The things I like about this product are ONE that it is super sexy, and TWO that the material is super soft! You never know with lace what you're going to get, and for the price I wasn't sure what to expect, I am happy to say that it definitely met my expectations, I was also a little concerned about how it was going to fit me, I'm a size 0 and wear a 32D so I was hoping to not be too disappointed, while it was a little lose on the bottom it was huge or falling off of me. The top, I did have a little bit of trouble keeping my boobs in, but honestly once you are ready to get down to business I don't think that matters anymore. My husband loved it, and so did it!! Item is as described and looks exactly like the pictures.

Overall super pleased with this product, hope that in the future they will be able to sell them in other size options other than one size fits all, but like I said, it didn't look like I was swimming in it or anything. I used, threw it in the washer and didn't experience any problems. I have bought one like it from Victoria's Secret for 5 times more the price of this one and I can honestly say they're very comparable.

"Protecting your investment is really important. A screen protector is a must with devices with such large display screen as an ipad. I have a 3 year old and an case is not always enough when they are throwing on top of other item. Its not worth the risk of not having it.

-As far as the installation goes, my tip is to clean glass with some sort of glass cleaner and then wipe with cloth that is provided . Use reflation of light on the screen to make sure the screen has to fingerprints. Then use the home button to line up screen and then star to work your way by slowly that way u don't get bubbles.

"I'm normally a 2X, but taking the advice of the website, I ordered a 3X.  And although it fits, it's not as ""flowy"" as I would have liked.  I think I should have gone even larger!

"I got this hydration pack for frequent outings to a theme park. I love how light weight it is. The straps are padded and comfortable. The buckles are all large and durable. It's highly adjustable. Of course, it doesn't have a ton of space inside for extra items when you put the bladder in, but that's a given. It's just enough room to stick a few necessities inside. It does have multiple clips and a couple zipper compartments to store other belongings. I like the bungee on the front. Perfect for shoving a small jacket in.

I filled the bladder up and inspected it for leaks and found nothing. It seems quite solid! The water flowed easily when used. I like that you can thread the spout to the left or right shoulder.

Overall, I really like it. The construction is solid, the stitching is tight, and the bladder doesn't leak, so you can't ask for much more! It has worked perfectly for our first trip to the zoo this year. (Just enough room for a wallet, keys, and a change of diaper for my little ones)

Now the part you don't want to hear.  I DID receive this hydration pack for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"This is a cute top.  The zippers on the side really add a bit of interest and uniqueness to this shirt.  You can easily dress it up or down.  It fits as it should and the back is long enough to cover your butt.  The front doesn't quite come down as far as I would like but that's really the only negative.

"I have been trying out many different phone cases hoping to find one that is heavy duty enough for me and not manly looking. I am protective about my phone and don't want it to break if I drop it. This phone case is heavy duty and still feminine enough for a woman. I ordered the hot pink and black colored one.

I really like that this is rubbery around all the edges and corners in black. It also comes up the sides enough to protect the front and my screen when I set it down upside down. The screen doesn't touch the table at all. I also like the rubber buttons that cover the phone buttons and make them easy to reach because they poke out beyond the case itself. The bottom of the case covers all the plug in area with holes cut out for them to be plugged in.

The back is a cute hot pink that will help me to find it easily, whether it is in my purse or around the house. There is a hole cut out for the ""apple"" symbol to show through from the phone and is surrounded with a black edge making it look really nice. The pink back is more of a hard plastic piece and has a textured dot pattern in it. I do wish that is was a little bit more rubbery or rougher texture because it is a little bit smoother than I want.
All in all I give this a 5 star. I received this case at a discount for this honest review and all opinions are mine. If this was helpful, let me know below.",1

"This Daytech DT-C8818 Home Security camera just missed a star due to its software or app issue. Otherwise, this is one impressive yet very reasonably priced product in its category. Let me start with the issue first, the Cot Pro app. This app is actually decent and easy to manage. I had no problem connecting the camera and the WiFi. The issue is on some of its features like the Motion Detector and the Voice Alarm where it does not work. The incoherent instructions does not elaborate and assume that it is working, no troubleshooting page. I may have to do more research as I may have missed something (which I should not be since it is self-explanatory). Anyway, that is somewhat a major flaw. The other issues include video lag time and the two-way audio echo interference which is not my top priority.
I could have knocked out 1 more star but not considering the best part would simply deny this product a balanced review. Here are the highlights of this product. The security camera is of very good quality. Its responsiveness is excellent. The video appearance on my phone is HD clear and night vision great. The cable (power cord) and wall charger is of high quality and of which the connection is a micro USB. This means that you can just exchange the cable to a longer one without concerning yourself of what power cord to buy. The hardware (camera) including the accessories is a 5 stars for me. The apps Cot Pro is not bad except for the issue I have outlined earlier. It is a simple and user friendly app and I would give it at least 3-4 stars.

"Overall, this purse is nice. It came double packed in two sleeves to insure no damage would be done. There is a slight odd smell to the purse though. One that I could live without. And the charm that came with it is really cheesy. In fact, it's so flimsy that one piece had already broken off one I took it out of the package. I just threw the entire charm piece away. So for that and the odd odor, I took off a star. The purse itself is pretty, and there is adequate storage space inside for all of my things. I like that I can wear it around my shoulder comfortably.

"I bought this for a Kentucky Derby party, and have continued to wear it as a pool & sun hat afterwards. It is beautiful and sophisticated - I like the contrasting band of white to add some sophistication. It can be worn plain, as it is, or you can add a flower to it for a different look. This hat is not the highest quality ever, but it's the quality I would expect for a beach hat - sturdy enough and pretty enough to hold up to many uses, but not so fancy I have to worry about getting it wet or dirty. I feel like I could buy something similar at Target or Kohl's for twice the price. So for the price, it is an excellent value.

A few minor quibbles: there is a white elastic chin strap. Kind of weird, easy to cut off, and it doesn't bother me - just thought I would mention it since it doesn't show up in the product picture. There is also a black ribbon hanging down from the inside of the brim that seems to serve no purpose, so I also cut it off. And finally, it arrived folded up, and after several weeks of wearing it the brim still has some slight waves in it - not creases, it just doesn't lay perfectly flat. But none of these make me ultimately unhappy with my purchase. I would buy it again. I've now purchased 3 IL Caldo hats - this and the men's hat I bought are 5-star products; they knocked it out of the park with these, especially at these fabulous prices. There was one other ladies' hat that I bought that I did not like. But I think I can generally trust IL Caldo to have quality products.

"What a beautiful way to display drinks! I ordered this product to use as my beverage dispenser for my bunco group this month. Unfortunately, I severely broke my foot the day before bunco was supposed to happen and had to cancel my event. :( Luckily, I was so excited about this adorable display that I had already gotten it out, set it up, and tested it out. After reading several other reviews of customers who said they had a problem with the dispenser, I decided it would be best to set it up with just water in the jars and test it out for a few days before putting my originally planned beverage in them. (It has sugar in it and I didn't want a huge mess if something went wrong) The dispenser arrived all intact and in perfect condition. I quickly set it up on my kitchen counter and filled both sides with cold water. (I read in other reviews that this dispenser is NOT FOR WARM OR HOT BEVERAGES) We have tested out both sides and left it set up full of water for 3 days. It has been working perfectly and doesn't leak. My only reason for giving it a 4 instead of a 5 star review is I feel like the price is a bit high. This dispenser is kind of small and I was surprised to see it's size when I opened it. My fault for not checking the size before ordering. It is super cute and works well, but I feel like the price would be more suitable for a larger set-up.

"This is a nice mask, and can be used for many purchases. The only thing I could nitpick with is that the full design never really shows and there is no way you can wear it to have a flattering design. Other than that I love the multi use of this and the fact that it can help protect your face and neck from so many weather conditions. It is very soft and has a nice and cool fabric so when you are wearing it you don't sweat it off and if you wear it over your mouth, like you can, it is not hard to breathe out of either. I like this and I know it will help my hubby when he is out in the sun or fishing, but I wished it had a design on it that could be seen when wearing it.

"I purchased these for my microwave light after I realized that my microwave (and maybe most microwaves) requires this mid-size, E17 base light bulb instead of the standard full sized light bulbs or the mini chandelier Candelabra base light bulbs that I only have spare light bulbs for.  I was unsure if these would fit, so I was glad to find they fit my microwave perfectly.  The LED light is only 4 watts but is very bright and seems much brighter than I remember my 40 watt incandescent lamp being.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the LEDs are so concentrated in the small bulb that they provide more of a point source of light and don't diffuse as well as a much larger incandescent light bulb.  Also, as they state in the product details, they are not dimmable, so my low light level setting on my microwave does not function.  They do however provide a dim glow at this lower setting and may function as a night light.  These lamps are supposed to be very long life, vibration resistant and have a 2 year warranty so they should last many times longer than a standard incandescent light bulb.

"These black velvet hangers, sold in a set of 10, do what they are supposed to. They hang clothes - but with a few perks. They are:
1. Thin and sleek - so they don't take up much space in the closet.
2. The velvet fabric helps to keep the clothes from sliding off the hanger.
3. ""No more wire hangers, ever!""
4. Although thin, they are not flimsy. Nice quality - heavy-duty for their size.
5. There are notches in the arms to keep strappy garments in place.
6. They look good in my closet of pink and grey. I'm going for a look. Whatever.

- Lights produce a lot of heat - keep from combustibles
- Difficult to remove from packaging but everything was in good shape

"Wow.  I am truly impressed by this light weighted umbrella.  This is quite important because we plan to take it to Asia where we will walk alot instead of driving around.  There is not a fancy looking umbrella. This is formal, the lines are crisp and clean. The umbrella is large and forms a spacious spherical area. Room enough to have 2 people under it.  It is supposed to handle heavy wind gusts.  When more colors are available, I certainly will get more of these, they'd also make great gifts, especially to those who appreciate great styling.  I especially love the included carrying bag.  When you carry the umbrella on the shoulder by the carrying bags strap, the umbrella lies horizontally due to its own weight, so I usually carry it on my back with the strap diagonally across my body.  If I only put it on my shoulder it will drop horizontally and hard to walk with.  It makes me look like Japanese ninja but it is light weighted so it is not too uncomfortable.  That is the most important part for me - it's function and convenience.  As you can see on the picture.  I am overall happy with this product and will recommend it to people who is interested.

"I wanted a waterproof cell phone holder that I could wear around my neck when out watering the yard.  That way my hands can be free AND I don't have to worry about whether my expensive cell phone gets water on it.  Since I own it, I don't want to have to replace it.

The ribbon that they use on the neck strap feels heavy duty.  It has a thinner piece of string that attaches it directly to the phone holder, but that also appears to be strong.  There is a quick connect latch on it so you can easily remove it from the ribbon without having to unthread it each time.  I have been wearing it around my neck for a few hours today and so far it hasn't bothered my neck or cut into it, although you do definitely feel it.  The plastic materials used in making this case appear to be thick and heavy duty.  The clear plastic isn't cloudy and the screen touch function on the phone still works well.  It's harder to get to the buttons on the side of the phone, but with a little effort I still can.  It has a lock on both sides so once the phone is in you can lock it securely.  Before I trusted that this pack truly is waterproof, I laid it in a sink full of water with a paper in it for half an hour.  When I checked it, the paper was still dry.  Obviously it seals well.

My phone is an HTC with a protective case on it, which makes it a little tighter fit inside this phone holder, but I can still get it in and out without too much trouble.  I also tried it on my Samsung Galaxy S5, which has a protective cover too.  It fits about the same.

I haven't tried the armband because I don't intend to use it that way so I can't speak to how well it works other than to say that it is also made with heavy-duty elastic and velcro.  The entire strap, with the exception of a 1.5 inch piece at the tip, is the soft velcro side which allows for a lot of adjustment.

I received a sample of this phone holder free with the agreement I would provide an honest and unbiased review.  I rated it five stars because it's most definitely waterproof and it's made well.",1

"We decided not to buy paper towels about a year ago and these are perfect for cleaning up, especially spills in the kitchen! They are super absorbent and the colors are perfect when dedicating ones for bathroom, kitchen, and other uses. They wash clean really well and we have had no problems with staining even after cleaning up beet juice. We also use these to clean our dogs paws after long muddy walks. They love how soft they are compared to the previous brush in a tube contraption we tried. I love buying bamboo products because of how sustainable they are and the quality of them makes them that much more enticing.  That being said the one downside to these is the seams are not as high quality as the Brooklyn Bamboo baby washcloths and have started to come unsewed in places. I have deducted a star for that but they are still better than something from Target or Wal-Mart but for the price I expect a bit stronger thread to have been used.

+ At the end of my day I still have about 35 to 45 percent of battery, without any charge during the day, and that includes Bluetooth and wifi on, texting and video playing.
+ It is vert slim given that it has about twice, and a little more more, the charging capacity of a normal 3,200 mA battery.
+ It is RoHS certified, which means that you are not getting exposed to hazardous substances such as lead and mercury.
+ It comes charged (59%).
+ It is compatible with ANY Note 3.
+ It comes with a glossy battery cover, and with a flexible black case, which has a really nice and provide your hands with extra grip.
+ A tempered glass protector is also included, so you can protect your screen from breaking just in case you drop your phone.
+ It is very lightweight and easy to install.
+ The shipping process was very quick, and the box was easy to open.
+ The case does not cover any slot, button or mic, so you still have access to all those things.
+ The seller claims that is has a 18-months warranty, so feel free to ask for a refund or replacement if it stopped working.

"I have a several pairs of ear-buds that I use with my MP3 players, and smart phone.  None of them stay in my ears.  I can just be sitting as still as can be, and these things will just fall out of my ears.  It's so frustrating.  Not only that, but the quality of sound sure is different between them.  Most give me a tinny sound and it's irritating.  So, not only do they not fit well, but they don't sound well either.  But for now it was all I had, until this opportunity came up to try the Riwbox X7.

First of all, the ear pieces have a right and wrong way to insert.  Once I got that part right, they did not fall out.  It was so great.  Then I decided to go ahead and add the over-the-ear ergonomic patented housing design.  For me this was more comfortable.  Partly because I'm usually mowing the lawn or doing something active and don't like readjusting the ear pieces continually.  These were getting better all the time.

The final decision maker was the sound quality.  Oh my gosh!  These sounded so awesome. They definitely have a stereo sound effect.  The bass was great.  I never had bass like this with any of my other ear-phones.  Several songs I listened too, I could actually hear when there was supposed to me sound in the left or right speaker.  With my previous ear-buds that was just all a blended bunch of noise.  No distinctions between speakers.  The Riwbox X7 really sound awesome.

These certainly have my vote.  I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.  I highly recommend them.

"I really love this phone mount.  We've owned multiple different phone holders for the car because we travel quite a bit.  Other phone mounts usually have to be set up before driving because you have to make it to where your phone stays; but this mount simplifies that.  It holds my phone pretty sturdy, and it doesnt take a lot to pull it off the magnet either.  Only recommendation i would have is to have a choice of getting multiple magnet plates for the phones because more than one person uses the mount.  It comes with two, but it doesnt seem to be reusable once you stick it to your phone. Hopefully they have extra plates i can order just in case.

"I am the type of person who just carries my wallet into a store when I go out, instead of lugging an entire purser around when I don't find a need for it. So I was really excited when I found this product that combine both protecting my phone and my wallet at the same time. The wallet as well as the phone case are leather and made of high quality. The wallet / case includes a wrist strap for continent carrying and it is made so you can removed it if you want to . The latch to keep the wallet closed is magnetic, which I find a lot easier that messing with a button or a zipper and it holds very strong. On the inside of the case, the wallet is on the left and your phone is kept on the right. The wallet part as multiple slot to keep a good amount of credit / debit / gift card and a clear slip to keep your drivers license. You can open this part up as well and there is a spot to keep cash. The phone case does detach from the wallet and is help with a very large strong magnetic. The phone case itself is also leather and looks very nice and expensive. The case though is more of a body glove or a decorative case. It mainly protects just the backing of your phone. The volume / power buttons remain open and the case goes up the edges of the phone very slightly leaving the screen completely unprotected, so I would suggest getting a screen protector or tempered glass to go with this case. The other thing I love about this wallet / case is you can charge your phone without having to remove it from the case.

It is two think layers, that I thought was going to be too sheer to wear alone, but it is actual not as sheer as I thought.  It has a belt that can be tied around the waist that is optional to ear because there aren't any loops on the dress.  I can wear this dress to work and not have to worry about my chest showing when I lean over because the neck is cut just right.  I love the length of this dress.  It is a little longer than I thought it would be, but with some cute wedges, all is well.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1

"Finally, I got a chance to utilize these gloves.  I have been wanting some that have the extra thick lecture on the top of the palm since that's where calluses normally are created. I've worked out for over half my life and these are great to use. I would have used these ten years ago if they were available--along with its affordability--to lift more and do more reps, since I would rip some of the calluses off to where there was raw skin.  Awesome product worth the money spent. I definitely would promote this product to anyone.

"These coasters are perfect for cold drinks, the grooves on the tap the moisture and keep the water off the table or surface where you set them. as far as looks they are not the prettiest but they are well made, thick and can be used on either side. one surface has round dots, and the other circle like grooves. there is a base that holds them all together and they also came in a soft bag for storage.
overall I am satisfied with the quality of the product and the fact that they get the job done and protect my tables from watermarks.

"I'm always wearing my regular boots or shoes when it rains so I was excited to see these Western Ankle Rain Boots. They're very stylish looking for rain boots and I can wear them if it's already raining and still look great or toss them in the car if rain is in the forecast. I ordered a size 8 and wear a size 8 normally and they fit great. They are very easy to slip on and off and well-made. They look they will be very durable. I ordered the black because it's almost fall and I really like them, but I'm tempted to also order that pretty pink pair for the spring. The blue ones look really sharp too.

"First off let me say, If I've reviewed something, the seller knows beforehand I write honest reviews and don't automatically 5 star everything.  Secondly.  These reviews like this, sellers can tell and select to not offer reviews to people who don't 5 star everything.  I can point you to proof of that with at least one company I review things through.  So sadly, I know this review is going to knock my ""ranking"" on the review site down and I'll be eligible for even less ""cool"" things to review and may wind up only getting to review vitamins and supplements...  Keeping that in mind, on with the review...

I needed a new battery for my iPhone 5s since I was putting a new screen in it and it had been sitting over a year.  I didn't bother to look at the reviews before I ordered this screen for review.  Lots of times the reviews are skewed anyways and I'll take a chance on an item from time to time, but there's one common theme that keeps popping up in the reviews and it stopped me in my tracks as I was getting ready to install this battery.

This is the fact people were reporting used batteries, batteries showing up with cycles on them acting like used batteries.  Batteries that don't hold the proper amount of charge they should or die soon.  I thought maybe they were just whiners and messed up installing the batteries and almost made the mistake of installing this battery.

I must admit that the pretty white wrap of the battery is why I got it.  It looked packaged nice and how cool to have a color matching battery under the hood of my iPhone.  I know only I would have known (wife says I'm such a geek), but I wanted it to match.  Then before I went to install it, I decided to peel open the wrapper and check out what the battery actually said.  That's when I decided I would stop right there, order another battery and not install this one.

The battery under the wrap, only had half the original screen printing on it.  The top half had been erased or scraped off some how and it was obvious to the naked eye it was previously used.  Even if it's recycled and supposed to be refurbished (which I didn't know they could do for lipoly batteries), it SHOULD BE CLEARLY STATED in the product's description.  This product should not be even sold on amazon.

If you were unfortunate enough to have ordered one of these batteries and don't mind swapping parts out of your iPhone every month or two, give it a run.  If you want to put a good battery in it that works and holds up so you don't have to go back in, look through my reviews, I just reviewed the good one today too.  This one, before you put it in your phone, just peel the sticker back and open it like a book.  You'll see what I'm talking about

Shame on you Stalion.  With the cool name I had hoped to get a cool long lasting battery but I'll never know because this product was improperly represented in the advertisement.  At least mention you're selling used or refurbished batteries before passing stuff off on people like this!

Sadly like I said, I'll probably not qualify for the ""cool"" reviews anymore but I'd rather be honest than a fake peanut hugger just so I can get killer deals.

*Disclaimer* I received this product at a discount or in some cases for free for my evaluation, use and subsequently my HONEST and UNBIASED review.  I REFUSE to rank something 5 stars just because it arrived on time and in good condition.  That to my understanding is for use with the seller rating system and I shall reflect such ratings where deserved there.

I myself have not found a program that does not require you to review the item you get.  So if someone says they do not have to review the item they got discounted or free, Id question their honesty

  If you have rated something on Amazon yourself, if you hover the mouse over the stars they each reflect a suggested level relating to your like or dislike of said product.  I will reserve 5 stars for something that I genuinely think people of similar interest will love.

  I will not review items the day I receive them and actually use them a few days to get a feeling of how well they are constructed and how well they work before sharing my experience. Though Im glad theres a system in place for people to get discounts to review products, I feel that the feedback on amazon is becoming littered with people simply sharing 5 star reviews disingenuously in exchange for free or cheap goods. It is due to this flood of reviews I feel the need to create this disclaimer since many glowing reviews are simply glowing from the sparkle in someones eyes at getting a good deal. I will not post photos on a review just to get credit for posting a photo review.  If there is a lack of photos or I feel a photo or video is needed to convey a pro or con that was unexpected with the product, then and only then will I add such to my review.  Likewise if the product differed from the listing photo, I'll add a photo if there are none at the time of my review.

It is in the interest of being open and honest that I feel the need to include this disclaimer with my review.  If someone has stated an item is great just so they could get a freebie, it does no help to fellow amazon shoppers.  I value my time and I am not going to waste time putting bogus reviews up.  Your time is just as valuable, so I would like to thank you for reading this completely so you can be enlightened when you see other reviews that were the result of a product/review exchange.",1

"I am pleasantly surprised in the quality and craftsmanship of this seat cover.  It is thick and made of durable materials.  It covers the seat completely from top, bottom and even the sides.  I have 5 dogs, and I love to take them on rides and some ride in the back while one or two like to call shotgun.  Having cars that have leather seats I make sure that the seats are covered because I do not want them tracking in dirt and mud, and most importantly scratching or digging in their nails into them.

I already own a backseat cover, but used a blanket or towel for the front seat.  Well not anymore now that I have the PAZINGA seat cover.  Goes on quickly and it stays in place!  I love that fact it has a storage bag to keep it nice and clean when I throw in the trunk when not in use.

"This is the third hose like this that I've purchased.  The first two were a disaster, the ends breaking off shortly after using. I really need a hose like this that is lightweight and easy to stow away. I bought the 75' version so I could water the flowers and plants on the whole property. I've been using it now for a couple months. I've followed all the precautions, turn water on slowly, don't leave it filled, drain right after using, etc. what can I say.... So far, so good. I sincerely hope it continues to work. I store it in the shade, because heat is probably its worst enemy, that and too high a water pressure. It's a joy to use, but treat it carefully. If it works, it's definitely worth the money. Don't buy a cheaper version!  I DID NOT receive this hose for free, but paid full price.

OK... it's a year later and the hose was stored inside for the last 6 months.  Fired it up, and it blew apart.  If it won't work after 6 months, it's not worth a star... period.  This hose concept is great, but there isn't a manufacturer that can make one hold up.  Won't buy it ever again.  Ace hardware and Lowe's sell a canvas hose which is hopefully lighter than a rubber one, which is what I want, light weight.  So the end result is these hoses are junk!",1
"These are so cool.  My tween daughter wants to gauge her ears, but she is not allowed to do that at this point.  These are the perfect solution to that problem.

"We have a lot of pests in Washington and we recently discovered that we have giant house spiders around our new home. Spiders are bad enough but the giant house spider has a body about the size of a quarter and then it has its legs on top of that; definitely not something that you want to come across in the dark! We are big into natural pest repellents because we have a 14 month old daughter and don't want to use anything that could be harmful to her. We also like that the ultrasonic Pest Repellent is a product that we can buy once and use for a long time because it doesn't deplete over time. I was impressed by how sturdy the construction of the device was, at this price I wasn't sure if I would get something that was sturdy enough or not. I took it out of the box and was able to plug it directly into the wall per the instructions that came in the box with it. It really doesn't get much more simple than that! There is a green light that shows it is powered on and a red light that says it is working, other than that it is silent to the human ear which is great because both my wife and I hate that high pitched whine that a lot of 'silent' devices emit. Because it is silent I can't comment on how effective the sound waves are, but it has a test mode that is in a range we can hear and if it does anything like that for the bugs I can imagine why they leave! I can also say that the colony of flies that used to crawl though our screened windows somehow are no longer coming inside the house which is awesome! I will be ordering more of these for the other door areas in the house!

"My crawlspace happens to have a very high ceiling since my house is on a incline, so I've converted part of it into a workshop. It has fluorescent lighting, but either the ballasts or the bulbs need to be replaced every so often and I got fed up with it. Looking for a more long term solution, I decided to give this a shot and see how it would look with LED lighting instead. I had to take one star off because of what I felt was a serious design problem with this light. I'm sure most fluorescent light fixtures are like mine and can only take a single wire on each end connector. This led light happens to have both connectors on one side and the other side is a dummy side. I was able to remedy this by opening it up, disconnecting one of the two wires, and running another wire across the length of the light internally and soldering everything to the other end. After my modification, the light works perfectly in my fixture, it puts out more light than the other fluorescent tubes that are still in my workshop, and it also comes on a second or two faster. I think I'll be converting the rest of my fixtures to LED lights also.

"I used to live in a hat almost identical to this.  It was a sad day when I finally lost it.

This hat makes me happy.  It's completely adjustable, so it will always fit my head regardless of whether I grow my hair out or decide to go Mr. Clean again.  The snap sides help maintain the shape I like, rather than looking like Gilligan.

The material is strong and takes a beating.  It was folded flat in shipping and popped right back into shape when I unpacked it.  I've found that I can roll it up in my pocket or stuff it in the bottom of my bag wadded up and it comes back looking crisp and new.  I love this hat.

"This is a pretty good case. It seems like it will protect my iPhone from short falls. It would probably not do much if I threw it across the room or dropped off a building, but I don't foresee that happening. It is easy to take this case on and off my phone. It does not add much extra bulk, which is really nice for me because the iPhone 6 (not Plus) is already a little big for my hands.
There are cases that provide equal protection at the same price point or even cheaper, but this isn't a bad product. I'd previously bought a shock-resistant, dual-layer Body Glove case from another website for less than $5. I bought this one because I like having different options for protection and style. The level of protection is about the same for both cases, but I can press the power and volume buttons more easily with this case than I can with my Body Glove case. The gold outer layer of this case looks really nice.
I don't know if I would buy it again if I broke it for some reason, but I am happy with this purchase.

This garden hose nozzle kicks tail. I'm visiting my folks out in rural California where there is a severe drought and I wanted to wash my two very furry dogs who had been playing around out in the dirt for two weeks straight. I did not want to use a water hose as that would used too much of their precious water. I purchased this garden hose nozzle and it did more than expected during the dogs baths. It was assembled right out of the box and I had no problems adjusting the sprayer. I used each one of the streams and found that the flat stream and the angled stream were the most useful while trying to get under the double coat of hair that my dogs have. At one point I did think that the garden nozzle was broken because it wasn't springing back or activating when depressed the handle. I adjusted the knob and realize I had somehow unscrewed the knob while bathing the dogs. Operator error. The grip and nozzle selector are soft rubber and feel very comfortable. There were no leaks whatsoever and I am sure my parents appreciated the very little waste of water. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion.,1

"I had always wanted to try using one of these, but was worried it would not stick or become too cumbersome. When I saw this one with this design at a great price, I just had to try it. I stuck it onto the back of my thin iPhone case and pressed hard for about 30 seconds. It has never come off or shown any sign of becoming loose in the past month. Two slots for two cards or ID is just the right amount. It is perfect for the gym or going out with friends when you only need one credit card and your ID. My only complaint would be now that I have this one with 1-2 cards inserted it is slightly thicker as expected, but it will often be enough that it may be hard to get it to stay in your car phone holder. This is just something to be aware of and not a defect of the product. I received this through a discount from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion.",1

While it doesn't get overly cold on the outside I do feel a slight coolness when I first touch it each time I pick it up to take a drink.  The plastic top that holds in either the top of the can or the area below the neck of the bottle, so that it cannot slide out, is very easy to unscrew and then put back on.  I have attached a short video on how it works.  A refrigerated can of soda stays a good cold temperature for over two hours in an air-conditioned home.  That is the longest I could stretch out drinking one.  I doubt many people would take that long but others may not be in an air-conditioned environment so I'm assuming that this will do the same job at a much higher temperature for at least an hour.

"I'm thrilled with these towels! I'm a student of massage therapy and I use these in my practice for a hot towel treatment. They have held up (for the few months that I've had them) with having boiling water & essential oils poured over them, steamed in a cooler, then draped over my client's back, then washed in hot water.  The size is larger than the usual hand towels that I use in our home bathroom/kitchen. I love that because it covers my clients back just fine with extra to spare.  They feel thick and luxurious. This was a great buy.

"I originally bought this case so my phone would be lifeproof against falling due to the amount of times I dropped it. I dropped my phone off of a second story deck onto cement, there was no damage. After I had the case for a while a jumped into a pool with it and it worked perfectly fine so I didn't use it again. I tried to be careful and not bring it in water again just in case it would leak. But just last night I went to a pool and it fell in the water. When I picked it up to turn it on it no longer worked. I opened the case and my phone was covered in water.",0

"I love this LED pet collar light. The LED light has three modes-- solid light, quick flashing (strobe), and a slower flash setting. I like that there are so many colors to choose from. It's a light weight addition to any dog collar for safe walking at night. The only thing that I didn't like is that it was a little hard to push the clip in. It wasn't hard to get it on because you can press it on the collar ring, but to get it off around the collar ring was a struggle. Other than that, it was everything I was looking for and I highly recommend this LED light! It can be used for so many other things other than just pet collars too!

"Don't you hate it when you put your herbs in your grinder only to fing most of them sitting in the top of the grinder when you remove the cap?  I do but that doesn't happen with this grinder.  First of all, I don't have to open the cap to see if they have been ground and gone to the 2nd of the four levels.  Just look thru the clear top and you know exactly whats going on.  I have not yet had herbs get stuck in the grinder's teeth!  I bought this grinder after hearing someone with MS recomend this type.  Since I have a broken hand that didn't heal correctly, I sometimes have grip issues, so the crank seemed like a very good idea.  It is in fact, but I have noticed that sometimes the crank 'hitches' while grinding, stopping the action and that quick stop is quite uncomfortable to my hand when it happens.  I noticed that if I readjusted the lid a bit that most of the time that took care of the problem and it ground smoothly.  It could be that I am over filling the grinder or it could be a quirk with this particular grinder but its worth a mention as when it catches and stops, it defeats my purpose for purchasing.  The grinder is very large.  The holes for the herbs to fall thru were large, and I expected that the herbs would not be ground well, but I was pleasently surprised. They are well ground and I couldn't be more satisfied with the size or quality of the grinding ablility of this grinder.  The grinder comes well packaged in its own little box (inside the sturdy shipping box!). And when I opened the box inside the box, there was a pretty velvet like carrying bag to store and carry the grinder in!  I chose to give the grinder a 4 star rating rather than 5 because of the hitch in the grinding action but also because there is a slight texture in the kief catcher that makes it quite hard to get the kief out of the collection area.  It does come with its own kief tool.

"I received the band quickly. II received the purple band that is 35-85lb difficulty and 41"" and 1.25"" wide. It came with two smallish rubber bands to keep it together that will be great for folding it up so it doesn't create a big tangled mess in my purse or bag. I purchased this band to work on hip mobility, so the strength of this band is perfect for that use. For someone of my ability (140lb and 5'6"") the band is very difficult to stretch. If you're looking for something to work on ankle stability or rotator cuff stability this is not the band you're looking for (you need thinner bands). This band is better suited for larger muscle groups like closed chain squats, great for mobility, and especially great for stretching your legs. For single leg open chain exercises I think the reg would be sufficient maybe even the black depending on your strength, but I think the purple would be extra challenging. The thinner therabands don't have great longevity...they can dry out and crumble. I can't speak for the longevity of this band, but because it is thicker I can imagine that it will last longer.

I have used this in open and closed chain exercises also for hip lateral distraction to increase capsular tightness. This has been used to decrease pain and increase range very effectively.
This can be taken on the road for a strong work out, the uses are limitless.

I did some research prior to ordering to see what band would best fit my needs and found that ordering two bands, one thin band of light resistance and one heavier will actually provide you with multiple different amounts of assistance when combined together and used separately. I didn't end up buying two but only because I wanted to make sure that these bands were good quality and would last me a long time. After receiving the product I can say that they are well built and extremely thick which leaves me no doubt that these will not snap or wear down after use.

"I love this probiotic supplement. When I rescued my kitty, she was a stray, and she was fine except having a few digestive issues. She was dewormed, but still had them, and the vet gave us a free sample of an expensive probiotic that worked well but was out of a price range I could afford.

When I found the Pet Ultimates supplement here for a lot less, I jumped on it. There was a gap between the time the one from the vet ran out and when I received this one, in which my kitty had a little bit of issues again, but now she is doing great. Even if I skip a day giving it to her in her food, she still does not return to the digestive issues she had when we found her.

If you've got a kitty with similar issues, Pet Ultimates Probiotics is definitely worth a try.",1
"Had no clue that this display was a poorly supported monitor for Apple Macintosh.  No drivers at all.  I got it to work on my fully loaded Apple iMac 5K machine, but it flickers to get going and often fails to connect, which follows by a reboot.  When it does work, I have zero adjustments because there are no drivers for the Mac.

Aside from that. The corners vignette really bad and the resolution is subpar.  Keep in mind, I'm comparing to Apple's 5K 27"" display that is native to the iMac.",0
"This bag is the right size for all day use. I would imagine you can use this as advertised for 2-3 day trips however I have not used it for that. I have used it for all day hikes and everyday use. The bag cinches from the bottom and sides of bag, so if you aren't filling the bag it cinches up to become a much more narrow bag. The width of the bag is about right allowing the bag to be portable when cinched and expand when you need to use the full 36L.
It is made of Cordura nylon so it is more rugged than most of the standard nylon bags out there. Here's a link to a YouTube video comparing standard and Cordura [...]
The seams are all stitched well and reinforced where needed.  The straps all have velcro wraps so that the excess is not hanging off flapping around. Molle system is laser cut. This bag seems to have been designed by someone paying attention to detail.  I have my kabar bk16 attached the side of this bag for hikes. The inside is filled with pouches and zippers, but not overdone. See pictures, some Bags overdue the organization, this bag has one compartmentalized section and mostly open pouches.
The only thing I personally felt needed to be added was a sternum strap, these aren't expensive (8$) and are easy to add.. Many bags don't come with them. It does come with a waist strap. I did buy the skd sternum strap. Link here
I also added some condor bottle pouches https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0068SYN5G/ref=twister_B0086UBPDM?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1
There is a place on the bag for a hydration bladder to be used.  I have really enjoyed this bag so far and I will update my review as I continue to use it.
I received this bag at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion of it. I am going to buy another for my wife, she is a nature school teacher and loves the size of this bag and it's ability to expand and range of bag attachments using the molle system.

The bag also has a lifetime warranty, I was able to register for this very easily on their website despite a previous reviewers comment that he was not able to. I received several emails making sure that I was satisfied with my purchase as well from Jeremy at RDS. If you have any questions please ask and I'll try to respond.",1

These locks are great and they answer my search for an approved TSA luggage lock. The nice thing about these locks is they show you when someone has opened them. I have been given a reduced price for this item but my review is honest and not influenced by that.,1
"This is such a cool piece of jewelry. Very unique! It came packaged in a neat burlap drawstring bag. The mixture of colors in the glass beads are just awesome! You will find hues of white, cream, blue and green. I've been wearing it as a bracelet wrapped around my wrist three times. The string is elastic and fist very nice with a little slack after wrapped. It has a cute dangle with beads that accent your wrist. The dangle is not long enough to be annoying or in the way. It has a cute decorative knot followed by the bead dangles. This is also long enough to be worn as a necklace or I'm sure you could even hang it from your rear-view mirror in your car if that's your thing. You could hang it around a vase for decoration in your home. So many uses!

"This speaker is another great product of XBOOM's brand. It produces crisp sound and excellent bass for it very small size. This 3W speaker sounds as good as some of my 5W speaker. It is made with quality materials and is very durable. The small size makes this speaker easily portable. It comes with a carrying bag so u can keep all its accessories with the speaker which is pretty handy. It connects easily with your phone using its built-in stereo audio jack plug. My main issue with this speaker is that it has no control features. You have to control everything thru your phone. I'm use to Bluetooth speakers, like the XBOOM Mini Ultra Portable Wireless speaker, that have all the control features you need to do it all without your phone controls. This is a great speaker for the technology challenged. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",1
love the pants but they are two sizes too big,0
"For all the hyperbolic marketing puffery used to describe this product at the end of the day it's a pair of nesting tables with a bit of a twist. Together the tables don't even add up to 3 square feet. They're made of ordinary particle board covered with plain old black melamine. Simple. Functional. Utilitarian.

The twist? The legs can be different lengths. And I can actually go ""pro"" or ""con"" with this feature because of the convoluted way in which they address the issue of making the height adjustable. There are any number of more conventional sliding and telescoping type ways to accomplish this which might have resulted in even more granular control as to the height. Instead they provide you with a bag of solid aluminum rod segments in three different lengths which are machined with a female and a male end and threaded to be screwed together to create the height you want. One issue I ran into was that aluminum is a fairly soft metal and the threads aren't exactly laser-precise...possibly from them just rolling around loose, banging into one another in that big bag they're dumped into prior the bag being heat sealed. More than once I ran into issues of cross-threading which necessitated far more delicacy than it should've.

Something else that really stood out and also speaks to a product where nobody was at home when considering the details was the product labeling. The Stand Stead logo isn't screened onto the melamine or printed or engraved on a small metal plate that's then permanently glued on. The actually used easy-peel stickers. No, I'm not even joking...see the attached pictures. What it communicates to me is corner-cutting run amok. It says unprofessional. When is the last time you bought something with an MSRP of $249.99 and the company logo was attached with a sticker that peels off if you so much as look at it harshly? I'm guessing never.

And ultimately that's what kills his product for me in terms of being able to recommend it. Despite the esoteric height solution and the labeling that might be comical if it weren't so sad, none of this translates into a lower final MSRP. On the contrary they're charging an ultra-premium price for a product that's as cheap and common in its execution as it gets. Priced anywhere north of MAYBE $50 and this is a deal to take a pass on.

"These screen protectors are great for me! I loves that it was a two pack for such a good price! I now have them on both mine and my husbands phone. You cannot even tell that they are there with the cases on. I have accidentally dropped my phone twice now. Both times on hard tile with concrete underneath. Once flat on its face at about two and half feet up and it took it like a champ! The other time was on it corner then it flipped onto its face about four feet up and again it took it just fine. Between the case and the screen protector I feel that my phone perfectly secure, especially with my clumsy self. I don't know how my husbands phone has been doing with it, other than it looks great on it, since he hasn't dropped it. He does feel that there is an extra layer of protection and likes that it is crystal clear so that he cant even tell it is on there. For him it is a peace of mind. I too love the peace of mind I get from it especially the proven fact that it works since I dropped my phone already. I would recommend these screen protectors to anyone. I received a discount on this product for my truly honest opinion and review of it.",1
I broke out from the cream sample I received with the waist trainer. Nothing special about this one in comparison to what you can buy for half the price at Marshall's or Ross.,1
"Theres nothing better than a nice light duvet to add to your bedroom decorum. I was absolutely stunned with the quality of this duvet. It is so plush and SOOOO soft, the quality is there and it definitely feels like something expensive even though it is not. I like the rich eggplant purple color that I ordered this is. This cover feels so soft and plush, there hasn't been any pilling or extra fuzz. I wash this once every 2 weeks and haven't had a problem at all. I own a white terrier dog who spends more than her fair share of time in the bed on top of this cover and surprisingly enough I haven't had a problem removing her hair, either with a lint brush, or most of it usually comes right out in the wash. This is amazing in itself because her hair sticks to every, ESPECIALLY my comforters.
This duvet is light enough to use to cover up on summer night, but also will be warm in the winter, something I appreciate, as I love it so much Id like to keep it on my bed. The pillow shams are the plus and are just as soft as the cover. High quality, I am in love with this set!

Easy to set up and worked well with Comcast service and Charter service.  The one challenge faced is how to have the Comcast phone service work with this modem (it did not have the phone portion that comes with the Comcast modem).

"I absolutely love this USB rechargeable flowerpot mini fan. It actually looks like a little flowerpot. Its a light green with orange petals.  It can be powered by inserting in a USB port on your computer or it will run for several hours from the rechargeable battery. I have a quick charge multi-port USB charger that I keep on my desk and I just plug the fan right into it; its always charged and ready to go. I can then keep running it from the charger or carry it to anywhere a little extra coolness is needed. Its amazing that the blades are so soft, yet they put out such a strong wind stream. The fan has two speeds: low to give a slight breeze and high to really cool you off.

I love that this fan looks like a flower in a pot, and the stem can bend to direct the stream exactly where it is most comfortable. I have other small fans, but it is always a hassle to get them to blow where I want. I end up putting the fan on a box on my table or desk. With this fan, I don't need to do this: it looks so much nicer without all the boxes piled on the table!

This flowerpot fan is so adorable and works so well, it is going to be my gift during the holidays for all the holiday gift exchanges and white elephant exchanges. Im so glad I came across this cute, creative fan.

"I ordered the Max Boost Galaxy S7 Edge phone case to test the quality of the product. It came sealed in a nice bag. This case is very durable and fit on my phone very easily and snug. The holes lined up perfectly with the buttons and the camera lens on the phone, and did not obstruct the use of the buttons in any way. This is the thin style case and it is very lightweight but very durable with normal everyday use. I had never heard of this company before, but I was very impressed with the quality of the product. I would highly recommend this product to individuals who need a phone case. I will definitely buy my next case from Max Boost.

"I wanted to like this screen protector because when I first put it on it was flawless! It fit like a dream and I hadn't found a screen protector that went fully to the edge and worked well with the beveled edges of this phone, but this is also the drawback. Because this protector goes so far toward the edges it makes it impossible to use a case with it without the edges coming up. When the edges come up then the functionality of the phone is lost to some degree. One of the main reasons I liked the S7 is because it was so easy to use it was very responsive and with this protector on you lose the smoothness in which the phone operated in before. This is due to the fact that with a case on the phone it makes it come up away from the screen. I tried everything to get it to stay underneath the screen so that I would be able to use this protector but nothing has worked so far. Also at first the clarity was amazing, but this protector holds fingerprints really easily and they are hard to remove once they are on there. I don't carry a cleaning cloth around with me and I would rather not be cleaning my phone more than 2x a day and it seems like every time I use the phone I am wanting to clean it because of the amount of dirt that this protector retains. The fit seemed to be perfect without a case. So if you are not going to use a case then this will be a great fit for you; however, you will also have to deal with the dirt on the screen so that is your choice.

Pros:
- Great fit without case
- Great clarity when clean
- Unique design

Cons:
- Loss of fit when case put on
- Stays dirty

"With all of the electronics that we have in our home we need to always have a charger ready to go. The Trond Bolt portable battery bank works great for us because we can keep it where we need it and do not have to be tied down to an electrical outlet. I can even through it in a backpack to take hiking and charge my phone out in the forest. It is easy to use. To charge it all I do is use the micro USB end of the charging cable and connect it to the charger and then use the regular USB end to connect to my laptop or a plug in USB charger. There are four blue lights that will light up when it is fully charged. When it is charging they will flash in succession. To charge my phone, tablet, headphones, rechargeable desk lights etc I just use the charging cable with the USB end to one of the three plug ins on this charger and then the other end to the item that I need to charge. You can use any USB charging cord to it. It is a little heavier than most portable battery banks but that is because it has a larger battery in it which means that it lasts longer in between charges. I can charge several things with it before it needs to be recharged itself. This is a very convenient charger for my family to use.

"So as you can see from my heading, green is my absolute favorite color. I purchased my Fitbit Blaze on March of this year. Let me first explain that I am a massive hoarder when it comes to accessories for my Blaze. Different colored bands, frames, protector screens, etc... I love being able to change up the look of my Blaze.
When I saw this green band, I knew immediately I HAD to have it. It is the same silicone base feeling that my origin purple band is. It is a perfect fit and all the holes are punched in and aligned correctly. Very simple to switch over from your current band to this one. The thing I am most pleased with is, it doesn't cause your arm to sweat. I've had a few bands, that no matter what, your arm would sweat because the band was so thick. No such problem with this one.

This was a great buy. The swim suit fits my fiance great. I bought her a medium size and shes very small and petite so it fit perfect. It is a very classy looking bikini that I've personally never quite seen in stores. The shipping was very slow due to the fact this wasn't provided thru amazon and it was thru a third party. But it came over the weekend and its time to be used. The bottoms i don't know if they are supposed to be so tight because a portion of her butt is sticking out. Don't know if that the look that they are going for or if its supposed to offer full coverage. Either way it doesn't matter because we have a Jacuzzi tub so this will be for my eyes. The top fits her great in size medium. She has a bigger chest but they the top offers full coverage with double straps it won't give the opportunity for slippage.

"It is really important to protect yourself from identity theft from electronic reader or scanning devices. Unfortunately, we do not know until it is too late. I like this RFID Blocking Card Holder Case! This is my first time using such a device and am so glad that I have it. I love knowing that this card holder case is keeping my cards safe from identity theft scanners and readers. I love how light the case its! It is also compact and fits in my smallest purse. The case is well made so it is durable and will not break. I also keep my insurance and discount cards and some cash in there. It is easy to open with a simple click. I like that it latches securely so I do not have to worry about losing anything. Identity theft is real and creates a lot of work to recover from.

Why pay GoPro three times the price for the same product. Will be taking it to French Polynesia for a real workout. No doubt it will make underwater filming much better and safer. BTW.

"This slicer is a very useful kitchen tool. It is simple to use, comes with multiple blades and attachments that store conveniently in the plastic container.

I haven't used it extensively yet -- but so far I tested it on these fruits and vegetables.

YELLOW SQUASH: excellent job. Uniform cut.
ZUCCHINI: excellent job. Uniform cut. I used it for slicing and also for julienne.
PEPPERS: ok job. I did this at the end so I might have been getting tired.
ONIONS:  excellent job. Uniform cut.

PROs:
Simple to use!
Five blades give you many slicing options and JULIENNE! Im thrilled about that. Ill be making some veggie wraps soon.
The parts, blade and hand guard fit neatly in the plastic catch container.
CONs or possible negatives:

The blades only slice in one direction but thats not a problem for me.
It is not dishwasher safe and requires hand washing. Again, that is not a problem for me.
There are no instructions in the packages. But really, you don't need them.

"I received my order of Green Straw- drinking replacement straws very quickly and undamaged. I was very excited to give these straws a try. Plastic drinking straw live forever in the landfills! We only use a straw for a very short time, 1 to 4 minutes at the longest! Why not use these paper straw that will biodegrade in just a very short time, a matter of days, not years! It is a very simple way to help out in whole recycling scheme in the world. These straws are really a cute product also! We go through a lot of straws in our house. We have a bullet, and we make a lot of smoothies! We make a lot of frozen treat drinks, and protein drinks. When the grandkids come over we use even more straws! I swear to they go through 100 cups a day! And each time they need a new straw. I tried the stainless steel straws and I just can't use them, the stainless steel bothers my teeth. I tried to do my part for replying that way. But this is a great way too!!  These straws did not break down while I was drinking through them. They held up while I was using them.

"First of all, I received this battery pack at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

The battery pack arrived promptly and packaged well. A little smaller than I imagined but that's a good thing. Feels very sturdy and rigid.  I left this in the window of my house for 24 hours to get a full charge. It charged my phone from 30 to 100% about 4 times (learning to play Pokemon Go) and I had to get it back for some solar charging. I let it sit under fluorescent lights over night and the green light stayed on but it never really charged.  The green light lets you know it's charging.  I then let it sit out in the sun for another hour and it never got past one blue light. 4 blue lights indicates a full charge. This pack does require at least a full 8 hours of direct sunlight to get a full charge.  The multi cord USB plug in that comes with it is very handy to have. I used this to charge my iPhone, iPad, Fire tablet and it charged a buddies android phone.  I let it sit out in the rain and it still works fine.  I am going to give this 4 stars because sometimes it takes more than 8 hours to get it to 100%.  Otherwise, I'm happy with it.",1

"I have lots of kitchen thermometers, but only had one instant read. I find I never use the others any more. I wanted a second instant read and this one sounded like a good choice.

I really like that it has a table on it with temperatures and that the probe folds up. Having it pop on when you open it is a plus also.  I don't use the magnet, I keep my thermometers in a drawer. I do like the smaller size that takes up less room. The magnet would be handy if we were to use it out on the grill.

Some reviewers said they had trouble opening the probe but I had no problem. You do need to open in the middle since the probe end snaps into the case and there is no space to grab there.

Although the pictures make it appear that you can have it partially open at an angle, I don't see how you can do that. It is either open straight out or closed.

I did receive a discount on this thermometer in exchange for my honest review.  This style is an excellant choice for a kitchen thermometer. I can't really find any negatives for it for my purposes.  The temperature read on this one is faster than my older ""instant"" read. I'm sure it will become my new favorite.",1

"I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  I really like the look and feel of this case.  I ordered it in pink, but there were several colors to choose from.  This case is very slim fitting and shows very little of the actual phone which is nice because you don't have to worry about mismatching.  The case is actually two pieces (not including the screen protector).  The material of the case is not too stiff to be comfortable in your hand.  This case fits my iPhone 6S Plus quite well and has all of the appropriate cutouts for the various buttons, sensors, etc.  I do not believe that this case is going to scratch and dent easily like some of the others.  The only slight disappointment I have from this set is the screen protector.  I cannot manage to get it to be bubble free with the case on.  I initially put the screen protector on first, but then tried to remedy this issue by removing it and applying the case before the screen protector.  There is still air under the corners.  This is unfortunate as I otherwise would totally love this set. I'm not sure whether a full size tempered glass screen protector will fit under this case.  I forgot to mention that the screen protector is only the size of the display part of the screen instead of full front like other screen protectors.",1

Other travel bottle sets that I've tried always end up leaking, the labels peeling off, etc. Other travel bottles also don't allow you to squeeze the contents out, so you end up standing there trying to vigorously shake the bottle to get what's at the bottom out, even when its still half full!

These bottles however, are fantastic! They are made out of silicone so you can actually squeeze the contents out and use every last drop of stuff in there. They have a strong plastic lid that the edge of the silicone goes through to be screwed on, which helps prevent leaks, which is great considering they are mostly being kept in a gym bag or in my car, and it would be pretty disastrous if they leaked all over the place! They also come in a clear zippered container which helps keep them all together as well as also preventing any spills. The clear bag also helps for those going through airport security so that all of your liquids are together and visible. It specifically says ""carry-on approved"" on the bag.

There are 4 silicone bottles in different sizes - two 3 fl oz (89ml), one 2 fl oz (60ml), and one 1.25 fl oz (37ml), and one smaller jar for face cream. You could also use the small jar for pills or daily medications for a short trip! The silicone is very soft and the bottles are easily taken apart and can be flipped inside out for easy cleaning.

My favorite thing about these bottles though is the labels! Most other travel bottles come with sticker labels that fall of or smudge when they get wet. These bottles have built in, pre printed labels that can be changed depending on what you put in the bottle. The white plastic piece that actually dispenses the liquid has an internal part that turns to change the label shown on the front of the bottle! The labels include: Shamp., Cond., Soap, Lotion, Sun, and a blank area. This is also great because if you use a bottle for shampoo this time, you can change it to conditioner later, without having to remove/replace the labels. I will try to include a video of the mechanism working so you can see what I mean!

Overall, I LOVE these bottles and will be using them a lot. I'd highly recommend them if you are looking for a nice set of travel bottles that won't leak and will make your travel much easier!

"The long sleeves offer maximum sun protection for my arms and the DRI fit polyester fabric is much cooler than any cotton t-shirt I've worn while riding. The DRI fit t-shirt wicks moisture away from my skin while unlike cotton t-shirts does not getting soaking wet and make me uncomfortable. The Cool DRI t-shirts cleans up well in a wash load with my other clothes and I hang them to dry since they come out of the wash wrinkle-free.

"This phone case from Bastex is perfect for any girly girl. The heart charm that attaches to the back of the case is so cute and I love that the kickstand looks like a ring! The actual case is clear which is nice because it shows the color of the phone you have rather than covering it up like many other cases. The kickstand seems to work great to keep the phone up right and is especially handy for watching videos. I also really liked that the kickstand came separately allowing you to place in on the case where it was the most functional for you. I also didn't seem to have any problems using and of the buttons on the phone with the case on.

The only downside of this case is that it does not offer a whole lot of protection for your phone. While it is super cute and functional I would be afraid that if I dropped my phone it might suffer damage especially with the hard kickstand on the back. The good news is the kickstand can double as a loop to put your finger through making it harder to drop the phone.

"This is great pair of equipment for home gym and push ups. I have had a pair of push up bars like these in the past that parted with my cousin moving out. They are great help in push ups. These is good product, well thought. I really liked the elevation they have from one end to another end, very helpful, something my last push bars lacked. The bars have soft cushion to provide support to hands when you are putting all that weight on your hands. The base is strong, wide enough to provide the balance. You have to be really careful of the balance of the bars else it can cause injury and this is well take care of in these bars.
I gave it 4-stars for the reason that, the material could have been little more stronger, I feel the push on this material and slight bending. I don't think it will break but gives me little uneasy feeling. This may be because my last push bars were completely metallic. Overall, very good product and something to have in the home gym!

"I love this egg holder because now I can finally have some style to the inside of my fridge.
Love the fact that this holds several eggs and it is clear so I do not have to guess as to how many eggs I have left.
The design is thin and not bulky so it does not take up much space.
Easy to clean and so far it appears to be dishwasher safe if put on the top rack.
I have actually used this to store Kiwi in as well as some other fruits and veggies
I have actually scooped ice cream ball in the area and frozen for in prep for one of my frozen desert creations.

"I am in love with this camera. I have been searching for a long time for a WIFI camera for my house so I can feel secure when my kids get home. Setting this up wasn't too hard if you follow the handy video on the card included with the camera. You have to connect your phone to the cameras wifi then connect the camera wifi to the house wifi. Once set up it was smooth sailing. I tried it first at my office to see how well it worked and there was quite a bit of lag. My work has HORRIBLE WIFI though so that could be why because once I got it home and connected it at home it worked with only a 1-2 second lag. I Loved being able to mess with my husband when he got home from work and talk through the camera to him!!!! I also like to mess with my cats as well. Comes in handy when they get onto something they are not supposed to and I can say through the camera GET OFF OF THAT and they jump right down!!! The night vision on this camera is superb. I ghost hunt as a hobby and my night vision digital camera doesn't work as good as this camera does! I may just have to use this to ghost hunt some time!!! I am extremely happy with this item and I totally recommend this to everyone!!

"I have a history of going through so many chargers for every phone I have had. Between losing and them just quitting, I was buying extras usually monthly or more often for myself or someone else. I would normally buy really cheap cords as they would usually not last long anyway. I have had my current phone for almost a year and am still using mainly the original charger with it. However, given my past of having chargers going missing, I still wanted to get a spare. These cords come neatly wrapped up (I used one before taking pictures-the not so neatly done one was the one I had already used and just wrapped up for the picture) packaged in a small box. Two cords are included and each have a wrap that sticks to itself (comes attached to each cord so you will not use it, but it can be taken off and reattached if preferred) for when not in use and makes for easier travel packing without knotting up the cord. They are very flexible and it does not look like I will have to worry about puncturing or the casing coming apart and exposing the inside. These are also good for when you want to use your phone while it is charging if the outlet is not too close because these are longer than standard charging cables and really flexible. I really do think I will have these for a long time as they appear to be very well made and have not given me any cause for doubt. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest thoughts and opinion after use.",1
These are much better than the plastic ones!  Definitely worth a few extra dollars.  People say they are hard to tighten because of the round collar.  Wrong.....They only need to be snugged up ever so slightly to seal because they have a rubber o-ring in the cap that seals it with very little tightening.,0
"I received a 3-pack of the BeON bulbs on July 1st and I am writing this review 3 weeks after having them.  Overall I really like this product and am excited to see where it goes with future firmware updates!

I was very impressed with the professional packaging and presentation of the three bulbs and modules.  I was quite surprised at how heavy the bulbs are but that did not matter after entering the first module = LIGHT without electricity ! ! !

Setup was relatively easy, but, as other reviewers have mentioned the use of bluetooth versus wi-fi makes the loading of the app as well as the connection to the bulbs quite a bit longer than I expected.  My hope is that future updates of the firmware/app will help make this time much faster as my Belkin WEMO app is pretty much an instant on due to the use of Wi-fi.

The big sell for my wife was the fact that these bulbs can be used for 4+ hours in case of a power outage.  She also liked the security option of being able to have them all turn on as she enters the home.  Finally, the training of the bulbs to hear the fire alarm was very easy and would be quite helpful in case of an evening fire.

I did have some issues getting the doorbell to be recognized but, honestly, that was not a feature I was overly concerned with in the first place.  It would be nice, however, to have that option work in case someone rings the doorbell at night.  I may contact customer service to get some help with that part as the individuals at BeON that I have talked with so far have been OUTSTANDING to work with !

I truly am excited to see what the future will be like for BeON as I truly believe that this is a product that can provide safety for your home!

"I ordered this helmet a few months ago, and I really like it.  I ride my bike between 25 and 50 miles (both on and off road) every weekend and having a good helmet is very important to me.  This helmet fits well, looks good, and keeps my head cool.  It is really lightweight and I usually forget that I have it on, which is a nice upgrade from my last helmet that was heavy and hot.  I have not had a wreck on my bike since I bought this helmet, but it seems built well enough to protect my head if I do have a wreck.

"This is a very nice ring, and I am happy to have made this purchase.  The ring is very thick; perfectly noticeable yet subtly masculine in appearance.  The meteorite inlay adds a mature and interesting contrast to the gold tungsten carbide surrounding.  There is really no telling upon first glance that this isn't a pure, solid gold ring.  It is heavy and very good quality.  This ring would serve excellent worn long-term, every day without showing any sign of wear or fading.  In addition, this is true to size, and fit perfectly on my husband per the size I ordered.  This could stand to be polished every now and then just to keep it in tip-top shape, appearance-wise, but is definitely made to last for the long haul.  Excellent value for the quality of the product as well!  And the box is fantastic as well.  There is no need to wrap this box up, as it also has an elite design that is sure to impress its recipient!

I received this discounted product in exchange for a review but i will give an honest one. My son loves this sleeping bag. its made of a 100% polyester with soft polyester taffeta inner liner with that being said it means its a pretty soft sleeping bag. my son uses it when ever hes sitting in front of the tv or he opens it up and uses it as a comforter when hes in his room. the material its made of makes it super easy for him to get in or out of the sleeping bag even when its completely zipped up. its not thick by any means so packing it for a camping trip should be pretty easy as it doesn't take up much room. i like that the sleeping bag can be used as a sleeping bag and a comforter as the bag completely unzips.,1

The top ring off of my compass has already fallen off, and my compass will not completely close all of the way. In short, it is poorly made.

While this compass does appear to work as intended (compared to the compass on my iPhone), and does glow in the dark (doesnt last very long at all) I do not think I would depend on this if I were traveling in the wilderness and needed a reliable sense of direction. It seems that it is more of a toy than it is a piece of survival gear.

"I received this in good order with no signs of damage or flaws. I ordered this as a spare for our laptop for trips or extended power outages. This battery was for an HP DV6. The battery locked cleanly into place and worked perfectly taking a charge without issue and operating the laptop just fine. It held a charge just as well as the OEM battery when it was new.  I am very pleased with this as I've had a great deal of trouble getting  replacement batteries from online retailers in the past, usually resulting in multiple returns and a good deal of aggravation.

"I am perpetually at the grocery store so the amount of plastic grocery bags that I have is obscene.  I am pretty sure that I and I alone, am killing this planet.  So here is my effort to leave a smaller footprint on planet earth.

I didn't really expect all that much from these, but freaking love them!!!  So glad I got them.  The package comes with 3 reusable grocery bags, and two mesh produce bags.

The grocery bags come with a little pocket attached to them, so that when not in use you can fold these up into a nice small package.  When in use, these are really big!!  They comfortably hold much more than regular plastic bags do, and I don't have to worry about them ripping.

I got the gray bags, and wasn't expecting much, but they are actually really very nice looking!!  I would say that they are more of a blue gray which I really like.

The produce bags are a nice addition, as the mesh will help your veges and fruits breathe  they will last longer.  They are big with a drawstring closure.  I wasn't really very excited to get them, but it turns out that much like the grocery bags, they were of great quality, and I liked them a lot!

All in all a great set for those who want to be a little more environmentally friendly!!!

"Love, love, love this top. It fits great and is very comfortable. I wore it to work the other day and received many compliments on it. If there are more I will certainly order them. This can be worn with so many things. Pants, skirts, or leggings. It is long enough if you want to wear leggings with it. It can be layered in the winter for some extra warmth. Put a long sleeve shirt under it and away you go. With the color variations in this top it can be worn with different solid colors as well.

"I love this birdbath!

It arrived perfectly packed. I was worried that the dented box would have broken bits inside - but the whole thing was packed perfectly and protected. It took about 30 seconds to put the stand together and place the birdbath in it.

The bath part itself is nearly perfect. I couldn't have asked for better, truly. Every time I thought I spotted a flaw, it ended up being a speck of dirt or something. The colors are bright and clear and the picture is perfect.

The stand itself is great. I wish the screws that held the center piece together would tighten just a little more, but it might be best that it doesn't. Without a little bit of give it might be more likely to tip over. The 4 legs make it very sturdy, even when I've got it placed in some dirt in a flower garden. I just pushed the legs in a little to make the stand flatter and sturdier and it works so much better than your typical Stake In The Ground item.

The bowl has a great incline to it for the birds. Plus it's deep enough in the center for me to place a solar fountain pump that I have. The suction cups stick to the bottom perfectly and the water is deep enough at that part that I'm not terrified that it will run dry in a few hours even if it's windy.

We actually had a chipmunk tip over the bowl one evening. The stand was still in place and the bath itself didn't get damaged at all. It's some nice thick glass, so I think it would have to hit a solid ground just right to chip or break. I'm just going to keep it away from the sidewalk or the patio.

I've had this one in use for over a week now and I'm really happy with it.

"I wanted something to fold up at the foot of our bed just in case it ever gets cold, and also to add some color above our white comforter. The bedspread looks exactly as I hoped and expected.  The color is just right.  The fabric is softer than I imagined it to be.  The imprinted pattern looks good.  The pillowcases are a bit too big for my king pillows.  The bedspread fits well on my incredibly tall king bed.  Not quite to the floor because my bed is so tall, but there's still a lot of drape  It has a slight lint problem.  Anytime I make the bed it leaves little gray pieces of fluff on my white comforter, but not enough to make a fuss over.

In my photos the comforter is a tad wrinkly still because it's new.  I think it will take a couple more washes to get the creases out from being in the packaging.  I've already washed the set once and it came out just fine.  Hopefully it lasts a while because at $64.99 it is one of the most expensive pieces I've ever bought for a bed!  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase so far.",0

"Easily transfer items from our delivery office to our home, 1/2 a block away.  So far have moved a 120 pound power lift rack and several heavy 45 pound plate boxes.  It has some plastic components that make it look a little cheap, but it's not. The plastic is just for the dolly/handcart conversion, which is really easy to perform.

"As a family of 5 heading off to the water park, amusement park, or day trip to the pool, I was looking for something that would fit what we need without adding bulk. I am so glad I found this product. It folds up into itself in the interior zipper pouch so A+ for portability. When I unfolded it I found a nice deep zippered pocket on the outside. I can fold up 5 beach towels and they fit perfectly in the main compartment. The interior pouch safely holds our phones, wallet, keys etc. The two pouches on each side hold our water bottles. And when it's stuffed to the max, It still is the size of a standard backpack. The straps are lightweight and comfortable. The design certainly is the only drawback for me, but It's practicality makes that a moot point. I received a discount on this bag in exchange for my honest review, and I am so glad I chose to purchase it! I'm considering buying 4 more so each of our family members can use their own on weekend trips. With the many selection of colors/designs no two bags will be matching.",1

"I ordered the basic black gloves in a size medium and they fit great. I could not ask for a more comfortable pair of cycling gloves. There is even the little ribbons to help pull them off when I am through using them for the day. I know most people will be using these strictly for cycling, but in my case I ordered these so I could use when in my wheelchair as well. I like the way they keep my hands from blistering and call using along my palm when I'm getting around. The wheels tend to rub my palm when I'm trying to brake really fast or change direction. I'm not always in a wheelchair, only when my prosthetic leg is giving me problems or I'm waiting to be fitted. I am very active and I need gloves to protect my hands. I use these  with my bike when I'm not in the chair, so these gloves are versatile and for that I am grateful. They are holding up extremely well to everything I put them through so they are made well. I like the way they fit and the way they look. There were quite a few to choose from and the sizing chart was easy to read and figure out my size using it. There was no guessing about it and when they arrived they fit. The velcro strap is comfortable and in the right spot and there is padding along the palm exactly where you need it to keep your hand from going numb. The padding is not crazy looking either...with a little here and a lot there or made from the material that cracks and breaks when you are using them the first time. It felt like leather and most probably is.
I was able to try these gloves out at a discounted price and then provide my honest opinion and review of the product. I hope you have found my review helpful. Thank you!",1

there are somethings that i do not like about it

"The original unit I bought had a problem with the battery, and the manufacturer gently offered me a free replacement after my review, which I really appreciated.

The new product is working very well and I am very satisfied.

Pros: (a) there are accessories in different sizes to help you adjust the plugs in your ears, which make the phones very stable even when you are running; (b) good variety of functionalities (answer a call through the headphone, for example); (c) nice case to store the device; (d) excellent price and customer service.

Suggestions to improve: (a) the volume controls and pairing/on-off/play-pause button are in the same side (right plug). As a result, it is very common the situation in which you want to adjust the volume and accidentally pause the audio. If the volume buttons were in the other side it would be much better; (b) I could not find the PDF version of the manual at the manufacturer website.

Overall I recommend the product, especially after the excellent customer service.",1
I love this color! It's coral and it's great for summer. I really like being able to change my bands out depending on what I'm feeling for the day.

Easy to set up and take down, and relaxing. Super small and compact and easy to fit back in the bag. I would recommend it for the outdoors enthusiast. Use it for camping.

"Let me start by saying the same thing almost every other review is saying.  This mouse pad is EXTREMELY dark.  The other reviews said it and I guess I just didn't gauge how dark it was. But on mine specifically, I can barely see the red of the mask.  And the blue is nowhere near what it looks like in the picture.

That being said. It still looks fantastic.  The lines (that you can see) are very crisp and the picture is of high quality, which is why I am so confused why the picture is so dark. But moving on from the picture, the mouse pad itself is very high quality and it makes the mouse glide so fantastically. It is a basic mouse pad size, and the material on the the bottom makes it so it doesn't slide at all.

Full Disclosure; I received this mouse pad at a discount in exchange for an open and honest review, which is what you have just read. All opinions are my own.

Overall; I think this is a very nice mouse pad and it works absolutely perfect. The only reason it even lost a star is because I can barely look and see what it is because it is so dark. But my heart and soul know what it is, so it all works out in the end.",1

"My favorite thing about this product is that it lays flat against you unlike regular fanny packs, but with that it also comes with it not having much give to it when you need to get into it. I feel if it was made out of a different fabric that would help a lot. I had all intentions of only using this when I couponed until I put it on and seen how flat it laid. I can see myself using this at amusement parks or any crowed area that I don't want to carry everything. I like that the larger pocket has smaller pockets inside that I can put my cash/cards down in without having to dig threw everything that I have in it. With it having multiple pockets I can separate my coupons from food or household, which ever I am plan on using at that time. My absolute favorite this about this belt is the deep mesh pocket on the very back of it. I can easily slide my phone in and out of it without having to try and fit it down inside. It also came with card protection sleeves which are extremely handy to have in high traffic places.

I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I feel this would be great for anyone like me who coupons, or people that visit busy areas frequently. It helps to hold all kinds of things and leaves you hands free.",1

"High quality boys dress pants.

Biermani Kids Boys Flat Front Slim Dress Pants

I ordered these Biermani Kids Boys Flat Front Slim Dress Pants for my son. I am very impressed at the high quality of these dress pans. These dress pants are made of 65% Polyester & 35% Rayon. These was very nicely on cold followed by air drying & ironing on cool. I love that these dress pants offer the adjustable waist. My son is on the slim side without the adjustable waist pants don't fit him correctly. They are either too big at the waist and too long in length or they are too small at the waist and too short.  With the adjustable waist he is able to get the perfect fit. These pants are made of high quality material and are super soft and very comfortable to wear. I got the size 6 slim the inseam on these are about 19 inches. These dress pants are great for pictures, going to dinner, formal family events,  school etc.

Pro's:
*High quality fabric.
*Well made of 65% Polyester & 35% Rayon with perfect stitching.
*Lightweight & comfy.
*Adjustable waist.
* Great for pictures, going to dinner, formal family events, etc.

Con's:
*None

Overall I'm very satisfied with this Biermani Kids Boys Flat Front Slim Dress Pants. I recommend this Biermani Kids Boys Flat Front Slim Dress Pants to anyone looking for high quality dress pants for boys.

"I got this for my mom for Mother's Day, and she really liked it. She hung it up in her room. It's so sweet, and so cute. It's glossy and honestly looks wonderful. It is a little smaller than what I expected, but that's my fault for not really looking at the dimensions. Literally, that takes nothing away from it though. I love it, but more importantly my mom does.

Quality item and adorable in person!,0
My daughter is 7 and these do not fit great. They are a little too tight and you can see through them. I received this product at a heavily discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  These are however really cute and good quality. I feel they are not any better than Hanes or Fruit of the Looms underwear though. So overall I like them but I don't think I'd pay full price for them.,1

"Product summary: Completely adjustable via velcro reflective vest. It comes with matching wrist bands and a carrying/storing bag. Also has a small compartment with zipper on the front for easy storage of small items.

Safety first. This vest is made for the night runner's safety in mind. I have almost been run over multiple times and it makes me so angry I just want to punch the driver. PAY ATTENTION. Anyway, I have not been almost run over in a while. Maybe it is luck or maybe I am highly visible. Who knows?

Tip: wear this above a shirt or other clothing item as it is not exactly skin-conscientious. It will scratch and itch. Also, the wristbands are not reflective. They are just colored to match. They are bright, though.

Con: The ""armbands"" are not really armbands. They are wrist bands because they don't even fit my scrawny arms. Small detail but other than that, perfect.

"This is not the worst webcam I've ever owned.  How's that?  It's very simple.  Plug and play, had it working to some degree within minutes.  I installed the software, but didn't really need to because Windows Camera and Skype picked it up right away.  This is good, because the English instructions are not very clear or helpful, and are clearly translated from another language.

So every review on this product has said this is a true 1080p camera.  If this is correct, then I am doing something grievously wrong, because everything was incredibly blurry until I manually took tweezers to the actual lens and rotated it.  The picture got a little bit sharper, but nothing I would consider ""High Definition"" (see pics below of me, unimpressed and ClapTrap looking not very sharp).  There is a program that comes with the camera, but it's really only good for filters and basic settings.  There is a ""focus"" slider bar, but it's locked.  It does not move.  Once you fiddle with the actual lens, you can get a decently clear, crisp picture, definitely adequate for Skype or Google Hangouts.

The housing of the camera looks nice, although the stand is a blessing and a curse.  The stand is rubber-coated wire, so you can bend it any way you want will full range of freedom and flexibility, but it doesn't always like to stay exactly where you put it.  The camera itself is on an excellent little swivel that can rotate a full 360 degrees as well as tilt in all directions.  It's definitely a flexible little machine.  However, I did notice an issue where the cable was heavier than the camera itself, so sometimes I'd get just the perfect angle, take my hand off of the camera, and the weight of the cable would pull it away.  It's a problem many cams have, not by any means limited to this model.  Overall though, on a physical level I really like this little camera.

I didn't experience lag nearly as bad as other reviewers seemed to experience, but to be fair my online use of this was pretty brief.  But what I got was a decent live chat where the video would occasionally be a half second behind the audio.  However, the framerate was not very good at all, probably 20-25 fps, I doubt it ever topped 30fps, let alone a steady higher framerate.

So overall this is not a bad cam, it's just not a good cam.  It's functional, takes a little bit of work, but if you just need it for casual personal use, it'll definitely do the job a lot cheaper than some of the alternatives.

And if anyone can tell me how to make this thing the 1080p everyone else is seeing, I'll happily alter my review accordingly.

Awesome sign for our pool... Gets plenty of compliments :),0
"This is an excellent case. It wraps around the whole iPhone 6s and has a bumper in the front so that the screen does not touch the table when face down. The bumpers on each corner help protect the phone when it is dropped. The back is a nice matte black finish that goes great with the black iPhone. I would recommend this case.

Although the side rubber grips work well, the back is extremely slippery.  The case is not camera friendly, in that it blocks the lens/shot.  Overall it wasn't easy to apply to my phone and even made me wonder if I hadn't received the wrong one for a moment.  The strangest thing is that it actually advertises a unique enlarged cutout for the camera so as not to affect the quality of your photos...oops.  The back is so strong that it is barely bendable which makes it tough.  The corners are rubber which I believe are made to go over the phone in order to cradle it in the front.  For instance, if you put your phone face down by accident (or worse dropped it) the rubber will not protect your phone.  It definitely needs a glass protector.  Even though it isn't bulky it stops my slim Note 5 from going in my pocket because it catches with the grips.  Not something I would choose for every day use, but it is priced accordingly.  No port covers for dust, etc.  The camo is as pictured, maybe a little more understated (in a good way) unless you really are expecting tree camo.  It is more of a dried grass, underbrush camo.

"These BIC Velocity Mechanical pencils are cute and colorful. They will cheer the kids up all day at school, at least they should. The are easy to use, easy to refill and are very comfortable in the hand while writing thanks to the rubber grip, my little likes that the best about these pencils. They write nice and soft and erases clean. The best part of these pencils is no sharpening required so they are always ready to use. These are great for the little ones for back to school.

"After reading other reviews, I made sure to drill my husband. He said they are thinner, that is the type of material it is. However, he did not find them see thru. We bought the blue. He found them very comfortable to wear while he was working. He does a lot of moving in his job, walking, bending, squatting, lifting, type things and it was hot out. He did get a bit sweaty, but not anymore then any other brand he has worn. He felt they breathed just fine. I did ask if he felt supported, if you know what I mean, and he said, if I must know, yes he felt very supported. Kind of an odd question for me to ask, especially as my teenage son came into the room, but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do to get an accurate review. Overall he is very happy with these. In fact that is the first thing he told me after wearing them for a day. He's about 6' and 160lbs, if that helps anyone. We purchased a medium. I included a picture of the inside of the waist band as I know some people have issues with that in regards to being comfortable.

"From the picture, I was hoping to get an enclosed package. And was not sure if the 2 pins are individually retractable or not (though, it doesn't matter if it didn't).

Also I expected it to be a bit smaller than what it is.

So here are my issues with this:
1.  While it serves the purpose (portability, tangling of wires), you do have to take good care of it. You have to pull both wires together always! If you happen to pull one a little more than the other, you are in for trouble. And you have to pull slowly and evenly and also have to put back in the same way - slowly. Otherwise, it does get tangled (It did for me and took some time to fix that).
2. Packaging, given that it is not fully enclosed (the writes are visible around the square middle portion with the Belkin name (reel?) . I would have liked an enclosed package with an inside tracks so it won't get tangled.

If handled carefully, it will server your purpose. Somebody has to make a better mousetrap....this is not it.",0
"Not too well made but it works for small things, just be extra careful not to toss it in the recycle bin! I prefer the more secure can safes.",0
"I absolutely love this bra! I have had it for a while now, and I wear it more than any other bra. There are no problems with the underwires, which I have been having a huge problem with. I was a little worried about the lace at first, but doesn't show through thin shirts, and doesn't cause any discomfort at all. I don't know much about materials of bras, but this one is stretchy and comfortable; it moves with you. It also covers up the back area well enough so other people can't see every little ""bump"" - very good bra. I would highly recommend getting it, and I will probably be getting more!:)

"This is a nice, commercial-grade ruler set; fitting for students and workmen alike.  Aside from its durability (made of stainless steel), the markings are all clear and easy to read and navigate.  There are hole punches on the top of each unit which is great for hanging up in a workshop or office setting for easy access.  The edges are smooth and will help to produce cleanly-drawn lines on paper or drywall or other materials like wood.  The smaller 6"" ruler is great for more tedious jobs, and work wonderfully for crafting with my kids (not as bulky, and easier to manage).
The set is built to last for a long time to come.  Great, quality set.

We picked the size in 34 and also the color in charcoal.  This is a very nice dark grey color. The size we ordered, 34 is the normal size we usually purchase in shorts and they fit perfectly. These shorts are very nice!  The material on these shorts are 100% cotton which make these shorts very comfortable on your skin.  These shorts have a wonderful amount of pockets.  There are 8 pockets in total.  You have two pockets in the normal side hip area, also 2 pockets on the backside bottom area and lastly you have 2  very big cargo pockets which sits on the sides of your thighs. These cargo pockets have a smaller pocket on top of the big pocket.  The pockets on these shorts have a lot of room to carry what ever you're wanting to as there is a lot of room.  The material can expand out as they are kind of like a parachute effect.  The hardware on these shorts are a brass color.  You will also receive  a fabric belt which makes these shorts look very nice.  At the end of these shorts you have the option of tightening the ends of the shorts with a drawstring.  I got these shorts for my dad! He loves that these shorts are cargo shorts.  The length of these shorts came down right about his knee.  He is 5'7"" and these shorts are the perfect length for him.  My dad loves to do things outdoors and these shorts are perfect for him to wear during his adventures.  He will be able to fill his cargo pockets with whatever he chooses to bring.  We definitely recommend these shorts.  I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",1
"I bought this ring for my husband and he loves it! He is a car guy and is always working with his hands and getting dirty. He also uses his hands a lot at work making the times he can wear his actual wedding ring very minimal. He's gotten a lot of compliments on it for how realistic it looks. People didn't even know it was a silicone ring. He said it fits great and is super comfortable. He wears it all the time now and has no problem working with it on.

Does what I need. I especially like the design of the taillight.  It's very bright while also being very small. The headlight mount is slightly loose on my handlebars. It's bright though and I appreciate that it can double as a flashlight.,0

"I never thought this sentence would ever come out of my mouth but here goes, I love these little poop bags. I have a puppy and like any puppy he goes a lot! I have used other bags but Pets N Bags are the best I have used and I will tell you why. These little green bags are super tough and create a great leak proof barrier between your hand and your dog's poo. As many of us women have, there are times I have long nails, real or fake, and my nails have gone right through other bags. (I know gross, right?!) Pets N Bags brand bags are so tough that this has never happened to me while using them. That alone has convinced me to continue to use them but I will continue.
It's been a while since I've had a puppy and I must admit that there have been times that I have forgotten to bring his little bags. Pets N Bags have this cute little bone bag dispenser that I can put right on his leash handle. It's light and very convenient. I received this product at a discounted rate for my unbiased review. Lastly, these bags are good for the environment. While I do not just toss these bags outside when I am done it is comforting to know that the bags are biodegradable and will not spend hundreds of years in landfills or what not. In the end Pet N Paws bags are the best the that I have used and I will continue to use them for my dogs waste.",1

"Wow! I had high expectations for these signs but they are way nicer than what I even thought I was going to be getting! With these, you're getting four quality signs - a two pack of each type of sign. This pack includes (2) 18""x24"" and (2) 12""x18"" Garage Sale Signs and then, in addition, includes (4) Sturdy Galvanized 15""x10"" Half H Frames for the yard.  And when I say sturdy, I mean STURDY! You put these in the ground and your signs aren't going anywhere. That means that these can be used over and over again.  We used these over the course of several weekends, as we were doing whole house estate sales, and we never had any problems with the signs or holders breaking, cracking, fading, etc.  They held up beautifully. As we have more sales to come, we put them back into the heavy-duty box they were shipped in and they'll be ready to go for us. This is substantially different than the dollar store signs we purchased previously that we had to throw away after each sale. Go for quality and they will be the most cost-effective and draw more attention to your sales. I received these at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I read the reviews on Amazon before I purchase a product and would never give a positive review or 5-stars to something that I didn't love.",1

"I'm a BlackBerry holdout in large part because of the physical keyboard. After about a year and a half of use, the keyboard that came with my phone got worn, with several keys requiring extended presses to register. This product provides all the tools needed to do the fix yourself at a most reasonable price. Several DIY videos on YouTube walk you through the process. It requires patience, care, and determination, but it works, and that I composed this review on my BlackBerry is proof.",0
"My first impression when I opened up my package was the color! It grabbed my attention right away. The color is bright just the way I hoped it would be. It is a beautiful light blue color. It was literally a snap to snap it on my laptop. The material is rubbery. It is soft to the touch. It makes it very easy to grab on to. The cover for the keys is the same material. At first I was not sure if the keyboard cover would stay put especially as I used it. But to my happy surprise it actually stays on quite well. I type away and it feels soft to my fingers. Again the color I am in love with, very bright.  The apple still shows through when the laptop is on to tell you that it's on so I like that as well. Overall good buy. Good quality and really pretty. Loving my laptop makeover!

This is a decent valve for the money. The rubber screw grip makes it easy to put on and fits 100%. The gaskets seal perfect and the ball valve levers operate flawlessly.

"I ordered this rooCase travel carrying earmuff headphone case because my husband could use one. He just leaves his headphones lose on his desk and they tend to get damaged. When I was looking for a product to buy I was looking for something that was made well and that was of decent quality. I also wanted something that wasn't too expensive and that had good reviews. I like to find out what other people thought of the product but sometimes I do buy products that don't have reviews. When I came across this product I decided to give it a try and let other people know what I think. The case fits his headphones well and offers decent protection.

"I'm a couponer that previously did not have a good method of in-store coupon organization. I was using an old wallet, which got the job done but was in no way an easy to use system. I use a lot of coupons at one time and I use coupons at a few different stores. Just using the wallet caused me quite a bit of confusion sometimes because I couldn't organize my coupons very well. I only had two different sections. This is so much better for me. There's a whole bunch of sections and most of the coupons fit in without having to fold them. With so many sections, it's easy to separate coupons by multiple categories (by store, by departments such as pet or freezer, and by amount the product should be after coupon and sale).

I got black because my fianc comes with me shopping sometimes and his way, he feels comfortable holding it too. He didn't like the wallet I used before and he wouldn't like shopping and carrying a binder with us either so this is the ultimate compromise. This makes shopping and saving money much more manageable. I received this shopping organizer as a sample at a discount for evaluation and review.",1
"I am very happy with my purchase. I purchased these for my ill husbands bedroom. He sleeps on and off all day and needed a black out type curtain but I didn't want a dark curtain. So I purchased the two tone tan and camel. And I am very happy with my decision. They look great and hang well there is no issue with the draping. The color is perfect just the shades of colors I was looking for. And according to my husband it keeps the light out very well. He is happy that there is no sunlight peeking through the drapes. The quality of the curtains are very nice as well they are of a higher quality then some I have seen and for the price they are definetly worth every penny. They do not look cheap and are very nice. I am very happy with this purchase which im sure you will be to. O the length was right on to they were perfect. I hope if you purchase these you are as happy as I am.

I did receive these free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I was not forced to give a good review this is 100 % my own opinion and nothing more. Good luck finding the perfect curtains for you. Happy Shopping",1
"Phone arrived on the 12th as advertised.  I took it to Verizon and the rep (who had been with them for two weeks) wasn't sure what to do.  I told him the ad said it was as s simple as taking the SIM card out of my old Moto x and putting it in the new phone.  It was that simple; it works if you are a Verizon customer!  I don't even notice the ads from Amazon but I have an Amazon Fire HDX tablet and am used to their ads.  After watching a movie, streaming live tv for a couple hours, listening to music, reading the news, Facebook, and checking email and weather all day it usually has 40-50 percent battery left.  It most definitely works on Verizon, is fast and I've had no problems whatsoever in the nearly two weeks I've been using it.  The display works fine, the camera is good (not great but didn't expect it to be), it charges rapidly and more than meets my expectations. It is not an iPhone but runs the latest Android and costs about 1/4th of what you pay for an unlocked iPhone.  I love it.",0

"If you have a yard that needs tidying up then a pair of these pruning shears is well worth owning.  I can't even count how many pairs of shears we have gone through, the last pair broke halfway up the handle as my husband was thinning out one of the backyard shrubs. These titanium shears are well made and very sturdy fitting my husbands grip perfectly.

The blades are sharp and we were able to tackle the overgrown camellia shrub and gardenia bush without having to stop. Each cut was clean and even. The bushes may not have looked very nice after their haircuts, but  the cuts these shears made were clean. Some of the branches had been allowed to get a bit too thick and these still made the job easy.

These shears fit medium to large grips and you are able to adjust the blades for more precise cutting. There is even a small wire cutting notch towards the back of the blades. These pruning shears are well made and have been making our end of winter yard clean up go a lot more smoothly.

"I love this blanket! It is quite thick with a tasteful pattern (I chose the blue); it is functional and looks good too! I ordered it because I like to lay outside for a bit on sunny days. It is large (57 x 70), there is plenty of room for me to lay down and be outstretched without touching the ground at all. It is so much nicer than when I just use a beach towel. The blanket is waterproof, so clean up is a breeze. When I am done, I shake it out and wipe it down with a damp cloth. When dry (which does not take very long), I just fold it back up, fasten it together with the Velcro and it is ready to go for the next time.

It can also be used as a tablecloth. I will use it for picnics, camping or anytime I need coverage outdoors. It appears to me to be very well made with high quality materials. The stitching is even and solid; the Velcro is sewn on, as compared to just glued on. I would definitely recommend this product to others.

"I am reviewing ILLUNITE Solar light 10 Ultra Bright LED Motion sensor security light waterproof unique detachable design with extra long extension cords for indoor/outdoor use.
The box includes:
1 * Solar light
2 * Extension cord
1 * Key pin
2 * Screws
1 * User manual

The LED light is pretty compact and the installation process is fast&easy, with less than 5 minutes. It is a 2 pc detachable units, where the top piece is the solar module and the bottom piece containing LED lights. Since this LED light is deachable, with the two extension cords, you can re-locate your light in a range of 10 ft where your solar module can absorb sunlight and convert it back to useable energy source!
The light is way to bright blue with 3 modes: dim, bright and off. The motion triggered the light on/off where an object is within 2 meter. It shuts off automatically in daylight and turns on with motion at night for energy conservation.
My dad love it so much!

"Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I was originally going to give these pants a 1-star rating, but they're really more of a 2.5/3. I ordered them knowing that people said they run small, but figured it'd be okay if I ordered a size larger than I normally wear. I have muscular legs--nothing crazy-- and normally wear a medium in Nike/Under Amrour compression pants....and I couldn't even get these past my mid thigh. And that's a size large!

I brought them to work with me and had some of my co-workers try them on in hopes that they would be able to give me their opinions. The only person who could comfortably wear them is my 5'1"" coworker who typically wears S/M in her clothes--and she liked them! They stayed up for an entire group fitness class, passed the bend over test (doesn't look see through when you bend over or show off your underwear), aren't a super thick material that holds in moisture, and they look very sleek on and hide some imperfections (cellulite bumps).

For me, these weren't an option at all, but for the price I received them for, it was worth it to be able to give a friend and co-worker a new pair of pants. If you can fit into them, you'll probably like them.",1

Came home used for 2 day and now it's acting like there is a loose wire in it and not charging unless I hold the cord still. Not a good idea with these pricy phones.

The second stopped working after only 1 week of my mom using it. Very disappointing. Darn shame, I really liked them, but then need to stay functional longer than this to keep a 5 star rating.

I'm really enjoying this charger, my best description of it is that it's soft and flexible while at the same time feeling sturdy. I feel like it will last longer than other cords I have currently, on that only time can tell. Hopefully I'll remember to come back and update the review on that part.

It's original selling features for me where the color the slightly longer than standard length. and the braided exterior. The color matches my phone which isn't needed but really is kinda cool. The length is extremely perfect. I find the three foot cords to be annoying and the 8 or 10 ft to just be a bit too long for most purposes, I do have a few for when I'm in a older house with limited or oddly placed outlets, but for home this is my new favorite length.  The beaded part is soft to the touch, kinda like baby yarn might be. And of course it functions as it should for charging and data transfer.

And a bonus for me is that the cats don't seem as attracted to these cords as they have been to other cords, time will tell one as well. If I've found the cord that my cats won't chew up I will be back for more!

"I love this phone case! It fits perfectly and even smooths out the rough edges from the phone! I love owning the Note 4, but I find the edges are rough on my fingers, especially when holding the phone with one hand. I tend to put my pinky finger at the base of the phone while searching, viewing or texting things. This always leaves an indentation on my pinky and I'd prefer it were a smooth round edge. This solves that problem!

When I first opened the package it came in I was a little worried that this was not as protected as with other cases I tried. I noticed the case was a light hard plastic with a metallic texture on it. Inside it has a rubber lining that 'fills' the missing sections of the case. So, yes, this is a little more 'delicate' than what I'm used to, but it still protects the phone and does it's job. All while looking good!!

I did receive the stylus as well, but that was so cheap, I only held it and barley touched the soft tip and it came apart! So, that was definitely not worth it. I'm happy it was just an added bonus that I did not need!

I was able to easily take the lining off the case to show you what I am referring to the liner filling the case.

All the cut outs are almost perfect. The hole for the phone stylus is great. I find most phone cases make the stylus harder to access because of the cut out. I did find the holes at the bottom for the Left microphone is off a bit, but I haven't had any issues while on the phone.

The buttons for the volume and to turn off the screen are great! One small touch and it reacts quickly as if I was touching the actual buttons! I love that they are so reactive!

The card slot on this phone is okay. I was so excited to have found a phone case that offered this. It was the main reason I purchased this. This is why I was upset to find the slot was a VERY tight fit for credit cards. I understand this is probably for safety reasons, but I could barely fit one credit card through the slot. I had an extremely hard time taking out my card as well! Needless to say, I won't be using the card slot!

All in all, this is a great looking phone case and certainly protects it as well. Just don't rely that the stylus it comes with is going to be good quality or to fit more than one credit/ I.D card, let alone, get it out too.

We have been raising and training purebred German Shepherd Dogs for over 10 years now and we feel that antlers are a great chew toy/treat for a dog for a number of reasons.

1. They actually have a lot of nutritious value for your dog.
2. They last a lot longer then most other chews that you can get.
3. They help clean your dogs teeth and satisfy the need of dogs to chew, especially teething puppies.
4. They give your dog or puppy something to occupy their time when you can't keep them entertained.

We gave this one to our 6 month old 90 pound German Shepherd puppy Loki, he has had it for 2 days now. In that time he has probably shortened it by about 2 inches. Almost any other chew we would have given him would have been gone by now. These are about the only safe natural chew toy that will last more than a few minutes that we have found.

If your looking for a healthy long lasting chew for your dog, I can't recommend these enough. Also the antler we received was not an old dried out bone, it was a high quality section of antler.

"This is a very handy tool set for anyone who does not use it on a daily basis. It will get you through a lot of tasks with no problem. Case is nice with a spring-loaded mechanism to angle the bits up for easier access to pull. It has nice tension and feels real solid. The driver itself feels good on the palm and fingers, but feels a little light. Other drivers I have feel a bit more sturdier and solid, but this one feels hallow. I am just being a bit of a nitpick though; should not matter to the average user.  The swivel felt a little rough so I pulled it off and rounded off the top of the driver just a hair. It was a lot smoother from then on. The magnet on the driver is a good addition and works well; I don't think the extensions have them though so it might be a problem. The bits are okay, not the best quality, but they will work if you take care of them. I have a Husky 8-in-1 set and compared to that, the torx bits are just a hair loose. There is more play in the screw head on these than on the husky. This played a role in stripping the screw head after I secured a screw on a hard drive. The Husky one was able to torque the screw without it slipping or deforming the tip. The play in the Showpin caused it to strip the head. This amount of torque is really excessive for something small, but it could come up if the scews have locktite on them. Surprisingly though, the tip did not warp!

The Security Torx only ranges from T8-20; it would have been nice to have all of them be security like the T5 and T6. I don't think anything smaller is security. Not a deal breaker, but it would have been nice.

Overall this toolset is great for anyone who might need it for small projects.

"A great value

Although I don't do any extreme sports and don't work in a high hazard environment, I still like having a waterproof case, because Im a mom. For a year I had the lifeproof case and was so disappointed  I had to have it replaced twice due to extreme wear and finally just returned it. It wasn't worth the huge pricetag.
This case here is actually BETTER. Thats right, its better than the more expensive, well-known brand. I couldn't believe it! And its much cheaper, too.
Here are the things I love about it:
1. The color. Its fantastic. The bright teal is beautiful and also easy to spot in a purse.
2. The material. Unlike other waterproof cases, the material here is harder plastic instead of soft rubber, so it doesnt absorb dirt and grime and get permanently stained. Thats a huge plus for me!
3. It works with my car mount. I put the metal disc between the phone and the case, and everything works great.
4. It will work over an existing screen protector (but NOT a tempered glass one)
5. The price is affordable

The things I don't love so much:
1. The charger port cover is very hard to open if you don't have something thin and metal. You can easily break/rip a nail trying to dig into it
2. The charger port hole is slightly narrow, it does NOT work will all brands of chargers. Some of the charger cables are too wide/thick to fit through it. My other waterproof cases worked
3. Its not the most convenient thing to use headphones, but all waterproof cases are like that.

Overall, this is a great value for your money, looks very nice and will last quite a while. Give it a try!

"I got these for my daughters' room and they love them!!!They are very bright and have lots of different colors. They do twinkle and there is no way to turn them solid, but really if you did you couldn't see all the colors. I do wish I could slow the twinkle down a bit though lol. I didn't think, as small as the lights are, that they would be quite so bright but they are pretty bright. Right now we have them draped under the top bunk of their bunk bed (they are 2&4 and don't use the top bunk yet) but I think when I get their double curtain rod hung and their new curtains up I will probably run them behind the curtain for a neat look! The cord before the light is fairly long, and i think this will make for a fun room! Totally pleased. The only thing is make sure that you are very careful how you unroll them. I got in a hurry and mine got tangled and it was horrible trying to sort them back out. They come where they just roll out though, that was totally my fault.

"This is a great little belt pouch.  It's made primarily of sturdy canvas and heavy duty velcro.  The belt attachment uses snaps AND velcro for extra security.  This has one large pocket and several smaller pockets, plenty of room to keep small items handy.  I will probably purchase one or two more and use these for hiking and camping, so that I can be hands free but still have all of my necessities easily accessible.  The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that it's a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but still totally functional and useful.

"I spend most of the time doing work at home in my laptop and I have connected a monitor with my laptop to work using two windows. I recently bought another monitor as it was easy to perform my work with multiple monitors. My laptop has a VGA port and a HDMI port and I have connected one of my monitors on the VGA port. I was looking for a cable to connect my second monitor with my laptop and found this cable.

I was able to connect my laptop and monitor using this cable perfectly and its works like a charm. This cable is a bidirectional cable to connect a HDMI and a DVI port enabled device. The cable is totally 6.6 feet which is excess for my need. The ports are gold platted and have perfect finishing.

I don't see any issue with the cable so far. My monitor resolution is 1600x900 and there are no connectivity or performance issues. The ports are easily pluggable and the DVI port screws are perfectly fitting. The quality of the cable is very good and perfectly happy with the cable. I received this product for deep discount.

"I have a Galaxy S6 and this worked great. It was easy to mount, worked well in any position, and seems like it will hold up for a while. I just drove down bumpy, windy, terrible roads for over an hour with no issues.
It would also hold a phone a little smaller than mine as well as a bit bigger than mine. It was easy to get the phone in and out, and if you are really worried about your phone falling out of the mount, there is also a lock to prevent the mechanism from accidentally opening.
I also like that it seems like it will work with the next phone I get because of the range of size that it has.

"We were already using a Kinivo 4 port High Speed HDMI switch for our front room TV and it worked perfectly. So when we needed one for our bedroom TV, I knew I would be buying the 3 port Kinivo HDMI switch.  We never have to use the remote, the auto switching works great, with the exception of devices that are always on, like our Roku and Fire Stick devices.  That's no problem for us.  We keep the Roku (Front Room TV) and Fire Stick (Bedroom TV) in one HDMI port on the TVs and plug the Kinivo switches into the other port.  Then we hook all of our other devices to the switches.  If we are going to use the Roku or Fire Stick we just use the TV remote to switch over to them.  I recommend this product.",0

"Any more it is getting harder and harder to find a decent charging cable that last for more than three uses.  The Fenix nylon braided micro usb cable is actually a good quality cable that does not wear out quickly.  Some of the past reviews have stated that the cable wears out and  has cheap plastic ends.  Fenix must have redone this cable.  The ends of the cable are very well made,  The Micro USB side is nice and long to fit into my phone even with a case on.  It is a tight fit, not loose at all and there is no problem charging.  The plastic guards are actually much better made than many other cables I have used.  They are not the brittle plastic that will immediately shatter if hit with anything.  There is even a slight give or bend that allows for some flexibility so you do not end up with the cords that break from being bent while plugged int.  The braided nylon makes for a good non-tangle cord that also does not break.  It charges my Samsung Galaxy S7 great and with out any issue.  If you have ordered this cord in the past with problems, I would suggest giving it another try.  This really is one of the more quality cables I have used.

"I am building a light fixture for my home that will have bare bulbs of different shapes as the light source. I like the look of standard incandescent Edison bulbs, but Ive been testing mostly LED bulbs that are made to look like Edison bulbs for the energy savings. As a result, you will find my reviews for a number of LED bulbs, in most cases dimmable ones, here on Amazon.com. Each review starts with a paragraph similar to this one and will end with the same disclaimer, but I have tested each type of bulb individually, and between this first paragraph and the last paragraph the reviews are unique.

These are incandescent lamps and are what I think of when I hear the phrase Edison bulb. They have the classic teardrop shape, rather than the bulb shape were used to, with the extra little water droplet in the top middle of the bulb. The squirrel cage design of the filamentjust one long filament going up and down and up and down a number of timeslooks great in bare bulb fixtures.

These are 60 watt incandescent bulbs. Wattage is a measurement of energy, rather than brightness, but weve all grown up measuring the amount of light given off by a light bulb based on its wattage. A compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) giving off the same amount of light would have a lower wattage, but we still purchased CFLs based on the wattage of an incandescent bulb that would give off the same light. LEDs use even less power to give off the same amount of light, so now were starting to understand the concept of lumens (which are an actual measurement of brightness). But (and finally were getting close to the point of this), because these are 60 watt incandescent bulbs, you might think they give off the same amount of light as any other 60 watt incandescent bulb, and its important to know that this is NOT the case.

A standard 60 watt bulb gives off about 800 lumens of light. Each of these bulbs gives off about a third of that, so don't buy them expecting that they're going to replace your old 60 watt bulbs. In fact, each of these will give off considerably less light than a standard 40 watt bulb does. The light has the amber color you think of with old lamps, so its not really appropriate for lighting a room.

These retro bulbs have a wide range from full brightness to the lowest end of my dimmer.  With four of these in a ceiling fixture at full brightness, I can see across the room Im in, but its still relatively dim and very orange. When I turn the dimmer to its lowest setting, the four bulbs give off about the same amount of light as one nightlight bulb (if the nightlight gave off an orange light).

"I got a small sized one (30) and the pant legs are as if it were for a larger person. The proportions are unrealistically sized. There's no way someone average with a size 30 waist like mine could have thighs that big. The thighs are very wide. Horrible investment. I am not happy with them.

It's made by an obviously cheap Chinese brand. The tags that it came with look way more expensive than the pants itself. The color is more neon yellow. Not for your average day chillin with friends. The color is closer to rave style shorts.",0
"I really do love this case, and like it needs another 5 star review? YES IT DOES!

I have a few cases for the LG v10 but wasn't really happy with them.. The light weight one didn't protect the screen edges enough (common failure point for me in the past) and the heavy duty one was nice since it can hold a CC, but it was just... heavy and duty.

So here I figured I'd give the TUDIA Slim-Fit MERGE Dual Layer Protective Case for LG V10 (Matte Black) a try. GLAD I DID! It's now the case that doesn't come off my phone. It's a well balanced case when it comes to protection, slim form and affordable!

It adds protection where it needs it, without blocking important areas of the phone like camera, power and headphone jacks. The headphone jack is big enough to fit any of the ones I have, 5 stars with that feature alone lol! Best of all, there is a nice thick edge around the front screen which will maximize screen cracking protection in case of a drop!

Though I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and honest review, my reviews are based on my personal experience with the item. I also base the review as if I purchasing at regular price and I do not guarantee 5 star reviews.

"PLEASE READ the entirety of my review, I try to be thorough. Out of box review is on YouTube- user NickWyn, ""Wealpe GOPRO Hero 4 skeletal housing""
*Summary: At half the price of a replacement housing from GoPro, this case is more useful. Only downside is that you lose waterproof capabilities.
*The Breakdown: the order comes with the complete housing, connector screw, and spare mount connector (with company name). Unlike other housings, this also comes with a screen protector on the front and the back (which is a softer material for touch screen use). I experimented on using this case with my friend, and we both concluded this is great for people who want to use attachments like a microphone, but want to keep their camera as safe as possible.
*Only one downfall was noticed but could have been my fault since I used a hero 4 black edition: the side access point cover must be taken off before putting on the housing. Unknown if this applies to the silver edition as well.
*Conclusion: the price and applications of this case truly do speak for themselves, would recommend for anyone who shares the same philosophy of use.
*Note: this product was given to me for reviewing purposes. I keep my reviews fair, and don't hand out stars.
****UPDATE: I realized recently that in a pinch, the Hero 3/3+ can also fit in this housing. It's not an ideal fit, but it does work.",1
"I got these as a gift for my friends 7 year old kid. From a gifting perspective I like the pouch it comes in, it has a playful feel to it and you can always use the pouch again afterwards for something else. I got the crocodile print and it is just as pictured, nice and bright. Its cotton so very breathable, not like those awful polyester items you sometimes see. So what does the 7 year old think of this? He likes the gator pattern a lot and thinks the material is soft. And very cool. All in these are well priced compared to other brands and I would try some of their other items as well.

This lens hood also came with a lens cap, lens cap ""leash"" and a microfiber cleaning cloth. All of these also work well. I do like being able to  keep my lens cap attached to my lens, keeps me from having to look around to find where I put my lens cap when I took it off. It's easy to use, once I attached it to the lens cap the elastic band just fits around my lens so that when I take the lens cap off it can just hang from my lens.

The tulip lens hood is easy to put on. It screws onto the lens. When I want to reverse it all I have to do is pull and the lens hood detaches from the ring that screws on. Then I can turn the lens hood around, push it back onto the ring and it is back on my lens the opposite way. It's useful for me because if I just want to take my camera without my camera bag but I don't necessarily need to use the tulip lens hood I can just keep in on my lens facing inwards.. that way I've got it in case I do end up needing it and it helps add a little protection around my lens.

"After dropping my five week old brand new iPhone 6S Plus and shattering the screen, I wanted to investigate better ways to protect the replacement after I got it fixed. As we all know our phones are an integral part of our lives and being without mine for a few days made me realize I needed to take better steps to take care of it. I've always been very careful with my phone and this is the first one I've ever had damaged and had to replace like this, and I hope it will be my last.

This case is very classy and feminine, and sparkles quite a bit. It is very pretty and I really like how there is an opening in the back to show off the Apple logo, and the Swarovski crystals are a very pretty touch.

"Following the instructions is a must when ordering this product. I am 5'5 and 138lbs. I normally go back and forth in sizes because I am on the border of a medium and large and a 9 in pants so I followed the size chart offered and ordered a 2x. While I DO NOT prefer ordering a 2X when in US sizes I am a Med / Large this suit fits me perfectly. The top offers a padded cup for some lift and support with removable halter straps that I love to reduce tan lines. The bottoms can be worn as a high wasted or folded down like yoga bottoms.

I will include pictures and as you can see I have a far from perfect body. I am still holding weight in my mid section from my pregnancies. I have excess skin in my stomach and have lost tone in my sides and back. I also have stretch marks and a C-Section scar. I am also in my late 20's and while I am a conservative mom I don't want to feel forced to wear a frumpy bathing suit that makes me feel old. This bathing suit has allowed me to feel comfortable in a 2 piece again. I couldn't be happier! Honestly I haven't felt this confident in a bathing suit since before I had my children.

"Every little girl dreams of being just like Ariel from little mermaid, I know I did when I was a little girl. Now that is possible with this beautiful crochet mermaid tail blanket.  The blanket is a good size for an adult or even a preteen.  It is a pretty pink color with a sparkly look to it, just what you would come to expect of something for a mermaid.  The mermaid blanket is full in front and has a half back which makes it easier to just pull it up on you to cuddle up and stay warm.  It does seem to be very well made and with the right care should last a very long time.  It is very soft and comfy and no worries about trying to get up with it on, because all you need to do is slip your legs out of it and your free to go about your life as a human.  I would not recommend trying to swim with this on as its not made for water only dry land.  It does come with a cute little note letting you know how to care for your new blanket as well as an adorable mermaid necklace which was a very nice touch.  It also came with a draw string bag so you can easily store away your sea legs for your next use or take them with you on a road trip or vacation,

"This is surprisingly fantastic!  It is very easy to use and easy to clean.  Often times when you drink wine and pour the wine directly from the spout, it tends to drip and or spill and this helps it alot.  All you need to do is open the wine bottle and push the cork spout in the wine bottle and it doubles as a easy pour spout and also a cap to store if you don't finish the wine.  This is so simple yet perfect for anyone who likes to drink wine.  Many times I've tried to put the old cork back on the bottle to put in the fridge or store away and I would never be able to put it back.  This is now my go to spout and cap for my wine bottles.  Would also be great for your olive oil, etc.  Perfect to add to a housewarming gift basket.

"This harness is okay.  There are no directions to how to properly place this harness.  When I put it on most of the time, it doesn't look right and I have to flip it around.  So I hope that I am using it right.  The first time we used this on our 80lbs pitbull, the kids had tied him to a post in the back yard to give him a bath.  When he pulled, he turned around and I thought the harness worked great.  There was some loosening, but I figured that it was the water and maybe it hadn't been placed properly.  The next time we used it, I found that when he pulled, he was loosening the harness.  I kept tightening it, but it really didn't prevent him from pulling.  After our last walk, instead of removing the harness, this kids thought it would be fun to attach a sled to him like he was a sled dog.  (No kids were in the sled)  He got going so fast that the harness actually somehow slipped off of him.  It seems to be well made and I like the concept of the idea, but this one just doesn't work the way I would like it to.  I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.",1

"Got it for our cat because he was having issues because of anxiety when we started trying to change his feeding time around (he would wake us up at 5am to feed him). This has been THE BEST thing.

It also seems to have cut down his eating too quickly and vomiting on my floors... we have it set to feed him 4 times a day. He has gotten so used to it, he will get to the feeder a minute or two early so he can be there when the food comes. Best cat purchase yet! HIGHLY recommend.",0

The torch is lightweight but still constructed of good quality.  It is very simple to use and you can use it for a variety of tasks.  I will be mainly using this torch for culinary purposes; mainly for searing the meat after cooking it via sous vide. Other tasks that you can use this for is for soldering, arts & craft, some light welding, or using it for creme brulee.  Theres a safety lock on it, an adjuster for how powerful you want the flame to be, and another adjuster to control how you want the flame to shoot out. I bought a large can of zippo butane lighter fluid from amazon to use with this, it was only under $6 for the large sized bottle and it looks like it will last be a long time.  Filling the torch is very simple, just flip the torch over and push down the can of butane for about 10 seconds and your're good to go.  According to the instructions, it says 10 seconds should fill the torch to full capacity but theres no way of knowing if it is full or not.  The instructions also said a full tank should last about 60 minutes which i find might be questionable.  The flame is quite powerful and its rated for up to 1300 degrees Celsius.  While that does seem like a lot, i wished it would be a little more powerful.  It took a bit of time to sear my steak as shown in the video below.  It would be awesome if it can quickly sear my steak.  Its a long video, skip to about 6:08 in the video if you want to see the torch in action.

"This white waterproof LED strip is another great buy from Oak Leaf. The build quality is very good - they look well made (didn't have any LEDs that were crooked or poorly soldered on) and the copper joints between each section is large enough to easily cut and solder to once you peel back/cut the silicone layer (make sure to reseal with acid-free silicone or another waterproofing substance if you do cut them and will have them near water!). I've used quite a few LEDs and the Oak Leaf brand is a newer one that I really like.

These are 9000-12000K white LEDs, which make them ideal for plant growth and are considered daylight / overcast brightness. I'm putting them in an aquarium I am building that will eventually have plants, but you could use them for anything with or without plants! They tend to have a cooler/more white glow to them and not a soft-warm look, so keep that in mind for your project.

These do not include the power supply, but are the fairly standard 12V 5A. I buy these power supplies for my LEDs:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Intocircuit-LCD-60W-12V-5A-Adapter-Charger-for-Benq-LCD-Monitors-FP2081-FP450-FP547-FP553-FP557-FP563-FP567-FP581-FP581-FP591-FP731/dp/B0023Y9EQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Intocircuit LCD 60W 12V 5A Adapter Charger for Benq LCD Monitors: FP2081,FP450,FP547,FP553,FP557,FP563,FP567,FP581,FP581,FP591,FP731</a>&nbsp;because they are cheap and do the job well.

These LEDs do have double sided tape on them, so you can remove the backing and attach them to whatever surface you want. Since I'm putting these in an aquarium that will have have moisture, I will zip-tie them to the top so I didn't have to worry about the tape ever wearing out and them falling.

These waterproof LEDs strips are IP65 rated meaning they are fully protected from dust (that's the 6) and they are able to withstand water jets hitting them at any angle (that's the 5), but are not rated to be submerged.

I really like the quality of these Oak Leaf LED strips and would recommend them to anyone! They include components to extend and attach to multiple LED strips if you end up purchasing more than one. I was given a sample of these, but will absolutely be buying this brand going forward if they continue to be such a great value for what they cost.

I was provided a sample of this product to review. Everything written is my honest opinion.",1

"Before I ordered this swimsuit I was told to order a size larger than I normally would wear in a swimsuit so I did.  Unfortunately, it was a little too big for me.  I really like it though.  I feel it is well made, it is definitely my style, and is a very pretty color.  I'm pretty bummed it's too big though.  It fits fine everywhere except my bottom.  It's a little too big there.  Just baggy enough there to be annoying to me.  I love that it sort of has the bra feature to it without it being overly obvious like hey look it's a bra in a bathing suit.  When I am looking for a swimsuit I look at how well it is made.  My father used to work in the garment industry and taught me to look at lines, make sure everything is straight, all the seams are tight no stitches sticking out, things like that.  I inspected this swimsuit from top to bottom and am impressed.  All the seams are perfect.  Tiny stiches where there should be, no loose threads anywhere either.  I love the blue and the white trim on it.  I love the style of it as well.  To me it looks like its a style that maybe was popular in the 50s?  About 20 years before my time but from what Ive seen in pictures of my mom and relatives.  The shoulder straps on this swimsuit are comfy.  They won't dig into your arms like many swimsuits do.  They appear to have a little extra padding on them.  I like that feature in a swimsuit.  I hate that feeling when you are in the pool swimming or laying out and after a while you are like ugh these straps are killing me.  I think the only thing I would change about this swimsuit is well nothing actually.  Its pretty perfect except too big for me

"These are very nice. The handles feel good in my hand. They are a little lighter weight than I expected. I particularly like that the spoon/turner doesn't touch the counter making it unnecessary to use a spoonrest.  It will be interesting to see how well they hold up over time. The utensil end seems a little flimsy. Overall I do like the design. I would prefer the turners not have holes in them, as it does make them a little more difficult to clean.

"Contents: This is the Best Sports wireless Bluetooth headphones Ive ever tried. I like to play outdoor sports or go to running so IPX4 certified sweatproof capability is a plus.

"Well now, this is a mixed review.
There are some things that I like very much about this little dog house, and some that I'm not so crazy about.
First of all, since the main description said indoor  / outdoor on it, I thought that this would be waterproof. I have since read the more complete description down further on the page, and that one says that it is an indoor shelter.
Sadly, though the vinyl is water resistant, the house is not water proof, so I can't use it outside in the way I had hoped that I could.
This is made of a soft, pliable foam which is covered with a flexible vinyl cover.
It is meant to be wiped clean rather than washed. I don't find that to be an issue but it would be nice if it could be washed once in a while.
If exposed to much water, as would be the case outside, the water somehow gets through to the interior foam, wetting it and that's no good. Luckily I caught it in time and brought the dog house back inside out of the wet weather.
I very much wish this house was meant for outside as well as inside, since that was my intended use for it. Yes, I know that I should have read the entire description, including the one further down the page, but...well, I didn't. So there's that.
The good;
Assembly was beyond simple. It came with assembly instructions, but I can't imagine anyone needing them, it is so self explanatory.
Just expand the body of the dog house, and place the roof on, lining up and securing the already  Velcro strips.
If you did use it outside, maybe in a sheltered area where it would be water protected, the Velcro is so strong that you would not have to be concerned about the possibility of it blowing off the house. On the other hand, the entire house is very light weight so it's just possible that the wind could pick up and carry the whole thing unless you about it somehow.
The little chimney thingy just sits on top as a decoration. It is only for an accent, as it has no other purpose. It is secured with strong Velcro as well.
The floor of it is ok but not very thickly padded. If your dog prefers a thicker pad it is easy enough to put one in, or even a small dog bed. It is soft, not rigid, so must be placed on a solid, flat surface.
It is really pretty cute, but definitely in more of a whimsical way. If you have small children, you can expect them to at least try to crawl inside the house.
I bought it for my smaller dog, who is a six pound (approximately) Pomeranian. He fits in it just fine with some room to spare but he has yet to be comfortable enough in it to lay down in it. So far he has entered into it to retrieve treats, but he has not stayed in. I believe he will enjoy it in the future. He is slow to adapt to new sleeping and cuddle spaces, but he usually gets it ok. It just takes him some time.
He loves to be in little cave like spaces, so I have little doubt that he will be enjoying this soon.
This would not look very good in a room or home where things are upscale and expensive looking. It would have to be relegated to a play room, family room, or kids room I suppose.
Hopefully this review has helped you to determine whether or not this little dog house is for you or not.
If I had not intended for it to be an outside shelter I would have rated it higher.
I think the main description should be changed to reflect the fact that it is only for indoor use.

"I received my Trail Camera lock and mount with steel band. My trail cam was stolen last year so I had been looking for a product that would prevent it from happening again this year. I happened to find this product. A 48-inch steel band with locking features? Please, and Thank you.

In the package, you will find the trail camera lock and an L-shaped key for the locking device. The banding is 48 inches long so that it will fit on many trees. It fit the tree my trail cam was already on, so I didn't even have to change tress.

To install the Trail camera lock, you just replace the currently installed nylon with the new steel banding. Wrap the new steel banding around the tree and back into the block of the lock. Take the included key and twist tight until it doesn't move. I tightened mine as tight as I could so even if a thief brought a cutting device it would be hard to get behind the banding to cut.

I would recommend this trail camera lock to anyone with a trail camera. I was so upset last year because a thief, not one stole my cam, but the photos of the 12 point buck I had been after. The thief then knew when and where to be to get my trophy. I have not found any cons to this product, but I will update my review if I ever find any.

"Buying clothes online always makes me nervous because I never know about the fit but I loved this dress and had to order it. When I first opened it, the material felt like it was going to be a very clingy material and not flattering but when I tried it on, I loved it! Its long sleeve but very thin so you could wear it any season. It shows just enough skin, not too low cut but far from a turtle neck. After reading other reviews I decided to order xxl instead of xl as I normally would. It fit great. Don't completely go by my picture, its definitely more flattering in person ;).

"Either this waist trainer corset runs really large or I'm measuring myself the wrong way. When I originally ordered the waist trainer corset it was way too big. The company was nice enough to send me a smaller replacement. It does fit but unfortunately I could still use maybe one size smaller.

When pulling the waist trainer corset out of the package it has a very strong latex smell. Leaving it out has helped the smell go away a little bit but it's still there. I'm sure as more time goes by the smell will eventually be gone. It is made very strong, the stitching everywhere is strong and doesn't feel like it will rip out anywhere. The hooks and zipper are strong too.

Even with this not being the exact size I need I really like it. It is very good in pulling in my stomach especially. That has been my biggest problem area that I've been worried about. I am finally going to be able to wear different outfits that I would no longer wear out of embarrassment. I am so very happy about that! It also seems to be helping my posture a bit. It is hard to get used to wearing at first, you feel very stiff and bending over is awkward but I sort of expect that.

"Great Earbuds!  I've been using them with my new MP4 player. As a happy coincidence, they match!  I'm really loving the noise canceling technology.  I am  a huge music lover and I am known for putting my favorite tunes on while cleaning around the house or going for walks.  The noise canceling works great for both of these situations as it helps keep the sound of the running water or vacuum from overpowering the music, as well as any cars that might be passing me while on my walks.  The sound quality is pretty great.  I have a live album of a concert I went to and I feel like I;m right there again.  I really like that each ear bud is labeled for Left and Right as well as the magnetic feature that keeps them locked together, which is great for preventing the cord from getting tied into knots.  The ear buds themselves are comfortable, even after long wear.  This is really important to me as it has been really hard to find a pair the fit easily and comfortable for me to wear.  They also come with different sized earbuds to ensure you a perfect fit.  It's really convenient to be able to switch tracks on the MP4 player from the built in remote on the cord to.  It means I can keep my music player tucked securely in my pocket while I'm fast forwarding or rewinding tracks.  Disclosure!

"Holy cow I cannot say enough good things about this brush! I have a HUGE and long haired beast (Great Pyreness and Bernese Mountain Dog mix), so I have a large and growing arsenal of brushes, combs, clippers, and generally any grooming product that promises to ease the shedding. Because my dog is double coated, he goes through a few times a year that he sheds his undercoat in mass chunks, but not so much stray hair around the house continually. This is nice, except during those shedding times when it comes out by the fistful (right now is one of those times). I had brushed him earlier in the week with another undercoat comb, the ones that look like a hooked rake, and that worked pretty well, but it was still coming out strong. The first day I got this, I figured I would give it a test swipe, thinking not much would come out by the looks of it (the combs are teeny tiny). I couldn't believe how much came out in the one swipe, even after him being brushed a few days earlier. I decided to wait for a full test fun until I could give him a full body brush, and this thing is sooooo efficient and so amazing! It hardly looks like it is going into his thick fur, so I'm glad to know it isn't scraping him or pulling out any hair that isn't ready to come out. It just grabs at the surface, and the hair practically falls out of nowhere. My dog didn't display any discomfort or act bothered at all, so I know this was just gently easing out hair that would have otherwise shed all over. I love it, I would buy another one in a heartbeat if I lost this one, or wore it out. Definitely recommend.

I have owned many pairs of crocs and this pair was a replacement to an old pair I had completely worn out.  These are a basic black flat with the nice cushy crocs feel.  I like the strap across the top because it keeps my feet completely planted in the shoe with no slipping.  These do have the suction sound issue I've had with a few other crocs.  Where your feet make some weird and uncomfortable noises while you walk without socks.  I find this problem usually goes away once the shoes are broken in.  I've been wearing them with a pair of no-show socks until then because the sock keeps the noises from happening.,0

The clips on the light are sturdy and very easy to use so you don't have to worry about them falling off and they're very easy to remove when you want to take them off. I never thought that this would be something I needed but now i won't let my dog go out at night without one attached to her. Id give these lights a 5 out of 5  *Disclaimer I was given this product in return for my unbiased and honest opinion*",1

"My issue is not with the product but rather the customer service.  My shipment was missing parts and customer service has been non-responsive after repeated calls over 5 days.

I have purchased this product before; the product is sturdy and offers a lot of storage for the price.  It is fairly easy to assemble, however the assembly instructions are lacking.  I overcame this by going to YouTube.  I recommend looking at several videos on how to assemble this because one video actually came up with a novel assembly approach which was incorrect and could cause injury if followed.",0
"I am a huge lover of maxi dresses but have difficulty finding ones that fit me properly. I often times find a beautiful dress online but then it doesn't fit me properly because it happens to be Asian sizes rather than standard US sizes. When I saw this gorgeous teal colored dress I decided to take a gamble and order it.

When it came it was even more pretty in person! The deep aqua color was absolutely breathtaking. The color really looked great with my skin tone too. The material was a nice, heavy material that didn't cling at all to me. It was flowy and semi-light while having some actual weight to it.

There were a few small snags on the dress but nothing noticable. The fit of this dress was absolutely perfect! The elastoc bodice was low enough that they didn't cover my boobs at all. It laid where it was supposed to unlike others which seem to not have enough space in the boobs. It really looked great on me! It just shaped with my body perfectly. I truly felt this dress was molded for me.

Overall I really love this dress. The color is gorgeous and really looks great on me. The fit was perfect and the material wasn't too heavy but not too flyaway either; just right. My only complaint was the small snags. Luckily they weren't noticable. I absolutely recommend this dress to anyone that would love to look fancy. This dress definitely does that for you.

"This is a very solid rug. The weight helps keep it in place and the bristle on top of a thick solid rubber mat should hold together for a long time. Already it has survived my cat trying to use it as a scratching pad and looked non the worse for the wear.

The printing and designs seem to be soaked deep into the fibers. Obviously I don't know how long those will last yet but so my feeling is for quite a while.

I received this mat at a discount in exchange for a review. I liked that this one said something other than the stereotypical ""Welcome"" without being too cutesy.",1

"When I get sheets or go to  a store to buy sheets, the first thing I do is unzip the package a little and stick my finger in to feel the sheets.  I was not expecting what I felt when doing it with these sheets.  The were amazingly soft!!  I couldn't believe how soft they felt.  So, normally sheets this soft are thin.  When I got them out, there were thin, but not see-through.  I prefer thicker, but the feel of these made up for that.  The next thing I worry about is if the pockets are deep enough.  I have a thick mattress and then a memory foam topper.  These sheets fit very well.  I had no problem at all.  Sleep in these sheets were wonderful.  They are very light and so so soft.  I've gotten sheets 4 times the price and haven't been this nice.  I almost feel like there are clouds on my feet. Very lovely sheets and will definitely get more.

I received these at a discount for my honest opinion/review.

Update-I've washed and had them on my bed for a total of 2 weeks now.  They are actually getting holes in them. I think it's from putting your elbows or hands on them and the stretch is pulling the threads apart.  Unfortunately, even though they are extremely soft, they don't hold up.",1
"This is a great little grow light that is perfect for getting some extra light to one or two small plants that might not be getting enough light where they are sitting. I like that I can easily move this light around so that I can put a plant anywhere in the house regardless of how much light from the windows it gets. This allows me to have a plant on my desk in a room that doesn't have a lot of light otherwise. It's small but bright and does a good job giving my plants that little extra bit of light to get them to flower more often.

The neck is very flexible so you can get this right in there where you need it to be. The clip is very strong and secure and doesn't slip off the table edge. There is an on and off switch on the cord within easy reach. This little light packs a pretty good punch. I really like it and so do my orchids.

"The tights shipped in a standard bubble mailer. They were secured well in plastic sleeves inside a thick paper packaging (see photos).

I enjoy these tights. I like that they are not too sheer, while not too opaque. Since I am very pale, I also appreciate that the ""nude to me"" color was not too dark; however, these tights might make tanner skin tones look washed out. The toes have only a seam and are not reinforced, which is my preference. There is no control top, at least not the soul-sucking, firm kind I'm used to from drugstore brands. However, but the seams are reinforced around the crotch as is depicted in the product photo. I washed them in cold water in a garment bag, hung them dry, and store them likewise in a garment bag. I wear my tights often, and replace them about once a year. They feel like average quality tights, and I expect will last about a year under my usage standards.

I am 5' 4"" and 110lbs. I usually fall in between the smallest size and the next size up of most tights. I hate it when tights sink lower than my crotch due to my height, so I usually order for my height instead of my weight. Thus, I got the medium. They are a little loose, but shrink up again after each wash. I'm worried that with continued wear, these will end up a little too baggy. However, I didn't experience baggy knees/ankles yet. I might try the smaller size next time, though. The reason I've docked the product 1 star is because I feel like they don't cater to the ""in between"" sizes super well; more elastic might help with the looseness problem. I will update my review in the future after more wear cycles to see how the elasticity is maintained.

I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. As you can see, this doesn't result in an automatic 5-star rating from me, and these are my honest thoughts. I'm happy to answer more questions about this product!",1

"Anker made another awesome product with this charger.  I was real hesitant about getting a charger like this, but now that I have it I don't know how I lived without it.  I had heard that cases could slow down wireless charging, and the thicker the case, the slower the charge.  I always keep mine in a case and I was afraid that it would add 4 hours to my charge time.  Turns out, not on this one!  A full charge takes my S6 around 1 hour 15 minutes, but with this wireless charger, it only adds about 15 minutes to that time.  I charge my battery every night so I just place it on the 'puck' and I am good to go in the morning.  Puck/case get warmer than room temperature, but they don't get hot by any means.  The sweet spot on my phone is not right in the middle of the back, but down toward the bottom more, so YMMV.  I have had to adjust it a couple of times to find that sweet spot in the beginning, but now that I know where it is, it is set it and forget it.  Love this charger and I am planning on getting another one for my desk at work.

I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest",1
We bought 2 of these for our front lights and they r very bright.,0
I quite happy with my purchase.  It does take a while to get used to the cocking mechanism being so tight but after a few days of shooting the rifle I am getting used to it.  I like the feel of the gun it is definitely not a toy and feels and acts like a small caliber rifle.,0
I am impressed with this cover. It fits my phone just right. I have had a few drops and it has protected my screen like it is supposed to do. I was surprised with how easy it was to put on as well. I just wiped my screen with included wipes and was able to easily put it on. I think it will last me a long time. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest unbiased review.,1

"The shine and detail on this ring is pretty nice. It is made out of tungsten carbide (TC) so it is very difficult to scratch - still haven't. The wood inlay looks very nice complements the TC very well. The shaping of the TC also provides a classy and timeless look. Feels very smooth on the skin. Their customer service is also top notch, as I guessed my ring size and and it was off by just a half size. I promptly emailed the manufacturer and within an hour or two I was offered an exchange for the correct size. If the style isn't something you're into, then the company and their customer service may be something you should be interested in. Overall I would recommend this product!

"Been using this at my desk when I am just sitting there.  This is perfect to roll over my feet.  It feels great, it is stiff and provides much massaging.  The item does have a plastic smell right out of the bag but I think it will go away.  It is easily cleaned and has a great color to it.",0

"I really think that the Humenn Band for Fitbit Alta is a great accessory bracelet for all types of Fitbit. I ordered the black Aztec pattern color for my mom and she love it. My mom love the color the design of the product. This product contains four different underside to replace the colors which are red, blue, pink, white and black. So far my mom really like it. As soon as the product arrived, she opened it and swapped the old bands bracelet out to insert the new black Aztec pattern bracelet. By the way, its really easy to swap the band in or out. She is been showing it off to everybody including her friends and family member. Also, she even got a complement from random guy at the grocery store about liking the design of the Humenn Band for Fitbit Alta. That complement made my mom's day much better. It's been few days wearing the bracelet and I don't think she is planning to take it off because it fits her style. So, also is very comfortable for her wrist as she mentioned. On my opinion, I really the product itself is beautiful and it gets the people attention really quick. The texture of the product is really soft in just case you are wondering. I would highly recommend this product to everyone and also I would try to spread the word to all my friends and family about the Humenn Band for Fitbit Alta bracelet because it's worth it to have more than just a pair. I really think its an awesome product. It also has more varieties colors with different design than this one specifically. In addition, the delivery package arrived early, I was not expecting early as I thought. Also, I have received this product with a promotional code discount at no cost at all for my honest review on this product.",1

"My family has huge cans from food storage. Eventually, when these items are close to their expiration date, we need to eat them. I have broken so many can openers attempting to open these heavy duty large cans. So, when I saw this on Amazon I quickly ordered it, hoping it would be better than the countless other can openers I have tried. It came quickly in good packaging with Amazon Prime Two Day Shipping. This can opener had no problem what so ever. I was so nervous that it was going to break, but it has done everything very smoothly. This can opener opens all sorts of cans easily without any hassle.
The only ""bad"" thing about the product is this: It's is weird to me that the can opener only has one handle. It took me a second to get used to because all of the other can openers I've had have had two handles.
Overall, this product seems sturdy and hasn't broken yet! I'll update the review if the product breaks (or anything else goes wrong.) Please note that I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review. This item still got the review it deserved.",1

We have a wood structure over our patio, thats made of criss-crossing wood logs and these lights are fantastic for decorating with.  I can wrap them around the logs to decorate them and they look like little fairy lights.  I did have just plain white lights, but these pretty colored ones are going to look so fantastic.

The really great thing about these is they are solar-powered so you don't need to have them plugged in.  I don't have to worry about finding an outlet or dealing with an extension cord.  I can use the included stake to stake them to the ground, or I can use adhesive tape to tape the solar panel up so it gets plenty of sunlight.  There are two different modes for the lights too.  You can set them to solid or if you want to get a little more festive you can set them to the blinking mode.  You can also use these inside, but without sunlight to the solar power or light they won't re-charge, so you want to make sure you use them somewhere where the solar panel can receive light.

"This is a very nice player!  I was very pleased when I received this and put it to use.
Within the past week, we purchased a comparably priced MP3 Player from our local mass merchandiser and we were sorely disappointed.  The functionality was terrible, and the sound quality poor.  After having that, this is a peach!

This player is very easy to use and set up.  Of course it comes with instructions, but, I admit, I figured it all out before even opening the pamphlet.  I love that this is a large capacity player, as well.  This makes it easy to utilize all that this player has to offer.  It is not just for music!
The screen is easy to read and, in general, easy to use.

Overall, I am very pleased with this player.  It is a very reasonably priced device that allows for so much more than simply listening to music!

"The LED bulbs keep on getting better.  I have pretty much my whole house switched over to some bulbs made by Feit Electric&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feit-Electric-60-Watt-Replacement-Omni-Directional-LED-Dimmable-3-Pack-144799/dp/B00O75K6AS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feit Electric - 60 Watt Replacement - Omni Directional - LED Dimmable - 3 Pack (144799)</a>&nbsp;that I got at Costco for just a bit more than these are running now.  I've tested other bulbs so was happy to help out when Vivid asked if I'd review their bulbs.

The first thing I did was install them in a fixture next to my Feit bulbs, which are also 2700K and rated as 60 watt replacements.  It was very hard to tell which was which.  The Vivid ones might have had a touch more of a yellow-orangeish cast but it was very close.  The brightness on both was pretty much the same as well.  The fact that these bulbs use a bit less power (1.6 watts per bulb less) impressed me.

These are really nice bulbs and don't generate much heat at all so you can use them pretty much anywhere.  They are a bit more top-firing than an old incandescent bulb due to the base of the bulb that doesn't light up so they are optimally suited for down-firing applications.  With that said, I put one of them into my hallway fixture which is side-firing and it worked just fine.

Overall I'd recommend these to anyone still using the old incandescent bulbs as they do make a difference in your electricity bill each month.  They out-perform and look better than compact fluorescent bulbs and don't have dangerous chemicals in them.  Recommended.

I just received this bag in preparation of traveling overseas this summer.  I did a lot of research and have to say I'm very pleased with this bag.  Its a good size for everyday use but still large enough to carry everything needed.  The security features are top notch and while not 100% thief proof (but nothing is) this will certainly make thieves look for easier targets.  The PacSafe stuff is top notch - yes you pay a little more but I believe it is well worth the cost.,0
"I was skeptical of the seller notion that these shorts are perfect for a number of shorts.

I don't think that at all. For me, these are perfect just for swimming NOT for biking.

Number one, the shorts fits perfectly, not snug but there's no room for support (i.e. jock strap) if you're purchasing according to your waist size. If you're purchasing a size up, every thing else will also be bigger and looser.

I ordered these for swimming and these definitely fits the bill.

"The large one is absolutely great for rolling out a pie crust or baking a full sheet of biscuits or cookies on.  The smaller one suits my smaller microwave when I want to nuke something that has cheese in it without having stuck the overflow to a plate so that it's hard to clean.  I am very pleased to have purchased this pair!

I have a couple of other silicone sheets which are right between these 2 in size.  They are incredibly useful when I want to use a 1/4 sheet pan to bake on and want ease of release for the baked goods or to take advantage of a thin crust of melted cheesy goodness which has baked into a wafer.  They are not, however, large enough to serve in place of a rolling board or small enough to use in the microwave.  This pair serves both needs admirably.

If you're considering these, go on and get them.  You won't be sorry!

"This is a great budget case that offers minimal protection and looks great. This case allows you to see the phone, but still protect it without adding a lot of bulk. This is a well-constructed case that is made of clear TPU material. The cutouts (ports and mics) are on-point and the buttons are protected. I am using this on the new IPhone SE and the volume and power buttons are harder to press. I was hoping that they would stay easy to press
The new phone looks great and I do not notice any fingerprints. I also like the fact that the case does not stick to the back of the phone causing weird bubbles or marks.
Verdict: 4-stars! The item is a steal!. I took 1 star off because the buttons are hard to push and a couple of port covers to keep out dust would have been nice. I hope you Amazon shoppers find this review helpful and take everything said above into consideration and give this case a try!

This really is a wonderful case just a pain to put on. The TPU on both the left and right upper corners on the back are hard to get popped through. I found your best bet is to get everything setup straight without the phone in first and then put the phone in. Once in, the case is not that easy to get out either, so if your one to change your case alot, this may not be your case.

Now that all that is out of the way, I can begin to tell you that I absolutely love this case! A huge thing for me and the first thing I check on every phone case is how well the buttons feel, and this case does not disappoint. The buttons offer a great feel and that clicky feedback that I just cant go without.

This case is overall very lightweight and offers pretty good grip. Even though most of this case is TPU, its not sticky and slides in and out of my pocket very easily. The back texture is also very comfortable in hand.

After taking a few pictures in low light using the flash, I didn't experience any ghosting of unwanted effects while using this case. Everything works as normal.

There is a slight front lip to help protect the screen but its not very much. I think this case focused mainly on being slim and not so much on the protection side of things. If you are one to drop your phone a lot, the thin bumper surrounding the edges is most likely going to crack as it is just thin plastic but I noticed that the bumper is pretty flexible and should hold up nicely if well cared for.

The charger port is of decent size, I did have trouble with one of my 3rd part cables but I never really use that cable anyway and its ridiculously big compared to all the nice slim design cables there are out on the market now.

How my Ratings Work:
1 Star = Awful. Complete junk. Do not buy. Stay far away.
2 Stars = Not good at all, but there are a few redeeming qualities...
3 Stars = It's okay. It's not terrible, but I'm not thrilled with it either.
4 Stars = Fantastic! I love it, but there are a few things that could improve.
5 Stars = This product is wonderful in every way. Buy it! Re-buy it! Worship it!!!

"I love sweatpants, especially for around the house as do most people. These pants are a little different than what I usually get, having a fitted cuffed ankle instead of an open leg. I ordered the Lg, at 5'2"" 180lb, they fit more like leggings, which is fine, and it's how I've been wearing them, under dresses or long comfy shirts. They are super soft, very comfortable and THEY HAVE POCKETS! Pockets are a big deal, when I'm just puttering around the house I need pockets to put things like my phone in. For some reason most women's fashions don't have pockets for reasons beyond understanding. The drawstring is nice and long so it won't disappear into the waistband very easily, another plus.
The pants seem like they'll hold up well, but I've also only had them for a week so I can't say for sure.

"I love wine, but don't always Finnish the bottle. This comes in very handy for those times. It is easy to use, although my hands get tired if the bottle is almost empty. This is much better than simply recorking it in so many ways.
1st, no leakage, you can even put it on its side, no wine will leak out
2nd it does keep the wine for longer, tasking nice and fresh. I opened a bottle of white and had a few glasses, closed it up using this and four days later reopens and it still tasted just as good, a big plus to me.
3rd it is small enough to take with you. How many times have you gone to a restaurant bringing a bottle and then recorking it to go home, making sure it doesn't end up on its side in the car so it doesn't leak through the corkscrew hole? Has happened to me. This is the second of this kind of thing I now own and I carry this one in my glove compartment, so I have it handy if I want to use it, another plus, nice and compact. I really a, pleased with this wine pump. The only con is it does make my hand tired from pumping it when used with a bottle that is almost empty and also for my favorite Reisling, which comes in a pretty big blue bottle, other that that this is really great.

"The lights are just as advertised with a nice glow. These lights came on time and were well packaged. Everything was in perfect condition. I absolutely love these lights! I got them to put on in my patio. The bulbs seem fairly thick and durable. While that is true, I was pleasantly surprised by how much light they put off. It's much nicer to be out here at night with these on, and not just the one-bulb light that we had been using. I know that you can purchase additional bulbs if needed. I'm not sure what the bulb life is, but they all are working as of right now and I have had them for a more than two weeks. Overall these are very beautiful patio globe lights and I'm super happy with them. I would highly recommend it to those who are looking for durable outdoor lights.

"This case it perfect! It covers all of the edges of the phone, without covering or interfering with the screen. The color is a little lighter than pictured, which is fine. I particularly like that it is 2 pieces, for extra protection. Most of these cases from the phone stores are close to $50 the savings here did not sacrifice the quality at all. I definitely recommend this to everyone!

"I love the style. Very useful for work or casual activities, and has lots of well-placed compartments.  BUT...the zippers on all the pockets broke within a few weeks and then the liner fell apart...so given the price, just know you are buying a disposable backpack.",0
"Easy to use, great sound quality, doesn't take long to charge, and stays put when I'm working out. I especially appreciate the ear hooks that come with it seeing as the buds alone never seem to stay in my ear. I got mine on clearance from Best Buy for the same price, best wireless earphones I've bought to this day.",0
"The first thing which worried me before receiving this cable is that it has not been rated by 'techies' for safety. There is a list of compliant and non-compliant USB C cables here [...] and this is on neither. What this means is that it is unknown if the cable itself has the required resistors for fast charging. Using my HTC 10, I could not check if it was one of the cables which could damage your phone if used with a fast charger, but it did not fast charge mine (using the same adaptor which came with the phone, with which other cables do fast charge).
However, the cable will charge normally fine. The cable itself doesn't look like it will strip, and each end is re-enforced to the connector so it's unlikely to fray. All in all, if you keep your expectations in check, it'll do the job for data transfer and as a spare (which is what i'll be using it for).
I would like to thank the manufacturer and seller of this product for providing me with a free review unit. Receiving this unit for free will not affect my review, which is my personal and honest experience of it.",1

"This is an ok case, but it feels VERY flimsy. The plastic is very thin. It can hold two cards comfortably, and a third can be squeezed in but it's a little tough to remove. I'm certain with daily use the back piece would come off fairly quickly. It's not very easy to open, which is good, but I'm afraid one time I'll push too hard to open it and it'll come right off. The phone pops in and out extremely easily, feels like it could pop off if it fell hard enough. The buttons don't give the best feedback, but they are pressable. Certainly this case is not meant for protection at all. I'll use it if I need to carry one card and an ID, if for some reason I didn't want to use a proper wallet case.

"After reading some of the reviews for this tankini, I was really worried about the Small size I purchased for my 120lb 5 foot tall frame, but I really like this suit.  When I first pulled it out of the package the bottoms looked huge and the top looked small, but overall fits about 90% as expected.  It's just so hard to find a bathing suit that works 100% all the way around.
I am a size 34 A cup size and this small fits perfect, and would fit a size B as well.  It's snug around the rib cage, so if I were a inch or two large it would be too snug, and would need a Medium.  As for the bottoms, they are made almost like a cheekster bottom, so they cover your cheeks about 75-80%.  I am impressed on how secure the suit is, and stays in place while jumping waves in the beach.  I would definitely recommend this for the vibrant colors, light padding in the top which hides nipples, and complete boob coverage.  I also love the solid hot pink hip accents.

"This has been an absolute hit in my home.  I love the plastic tray not only to use WITH the sterno heat but its also going to be amazing this summer for S'mores over a bonfire too.  Not only did the plastic tray keep everything in one place, it saved me from having to carry armfuls of S'mores supplies outside and back in later that night.  But enough about organization and ease for mom.....it was the kids who told me to put five stars on this.  They LOVED it, they loved that we didn't need to build a big old fire to have S'mores....that would could do this any time we wanted for dessert.  It was easy to use, the sterno heat was easy to put out at the end and I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends.

The one thing we are so excited about.......S'mores in the winter.  It is going to be wonderful to enjoy a taste of summer when the temps hit under 0!

"I'm very modest. I swim in an RV park membership pool all year long. I did wear a thick cotton terrycloth robe between the shower and pool and back again. That robe is very heavy, especially when it gets wet. Plus it's not always dry the next day to go to the pool.

I was pleasantly surprised when this cover-up arrived and I saw how large it is, especially with the extra fringe on the bottom. So, I took it to the pool and it really does cover up my swimsuit. It's thin and see through, but because it's red and has a butterfly design it does a pretty good job of concealing. With the fringe it's long enough to go to the bottom of my suit. It's open on my sides, but doesn't really show anything but the bottom of my suit. It does not have any buttons to keep it closed; that's the only thing I wish it did have, but it is large enough that it crosses over in the front.

I'll be taking this to the pool from now on. It weighs next to nothing, takes up barely any room in my pack, dries quick, and also has enough coverage that I don't feel so self-conscious. I also have an orange cover up from this company so now I'll have a spare. :-)

"I recently upgraded to this dry snorkel from a 15 yr old model I had as a teenager and I have to say this thing is awesome.  My pool is only 8' deep so I don't know how it will function at depths beyond this, but for me it keeps the chamber completely dry when swimming across the bottom.  No more having to shoot out water when surfacing and already out of air.  The mask clip is a little different than what I'm used to.  This one has a quick release, which is nice when you want to take it off to free dive, but makes switching it to a different mask take a little longer.  This doesn't really bother me and keeps the kids from passing around my new snorkel :)  I would recommend this to anyone needing a new snorkel.  They have different color combinations to choose from too.  I will be upgrading the rest of the family's snorkels with this model as needed.",0
"These cloth work very well for all of my electronic devices - iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro even camera lenses and small TV display.
And the each pack is amazingly convenient. Usually I bring a few packs of iCloth in my backbag and use them quickly for sticky iPad and toss away. I gave them to my friend and family to try them as a sample and they are very satisfied. I strongly recommend it.",1
"I love this shirt. I mean to the point where I want to wear it every day to work but I keep getting checked out by my older department heads and managers when I wear it so it's probably not the best idea. It arrived in a pretty decent package so I can say that they didn't just throw it in a box all wrinkly and awful looking. I tried it on the first night it got here and immediately noticed that it was an amazing fit. Like, snug and tight in the right places yet stretchy and comfortable at the same time. I have another slim fit shirt similar to this one and it's great but a little too tight and doesn't stretch in some areas, so I definitely appreciate that this one stretches a bit. It looks amazing, it feels amazing (I mean it's not some super expensive silk or whatever, but if you're that uppity then you probably need to go to a tailor and get your stuff handmade). Definitely adhere to the sizing instructions, I'm a small in USA sizing but I realized that in Asia I'm a Medium. If I had gotten the Small size in this shirt, I would have never been able to fit my arm through the sleeve, I bet. Anyways, I've worn this shirt about 3 times in the past few weeks and it still holds up great. No wear, no tears or streaks, still looks just as new. I would recommend ironing or maybe dry cleaning this shirt. I made the mistake of throwing it in the washer and it definitely doesn't look as sharp but it's nothing that ironing it out couldn't fix.

"We purchased this for our TV in our workout room. Its a 30 inch flat screen that hangs on the wall. Now I have past experience  with bias lighting as I have LED strips on the back of my 2 Vizio 55"" tv's and my 3 - 24 inch monitors. Over the years I have felt in my opinion that bias lighting helps with eye strain. Specially with me sitting in front of my monitors for long hours. I wanted this new TV to have it as well in the workout room and this one worked great, East to install. The tape is super sticky...I have had strips int he past that I had to buy my own #M double sided tape for but not this one...super sticky. It stays put. Plus into any USB power supply. Our TV has one on the back. Has its own power switch as well.  When the TV comes on it comes on but you can manually turn it off if you want. Perfect. For the price it will be hard to beat. If you are not sure about Bias lighting please google it. There are tons of studies and reports about how it works. Some people just like the ""cool factor"" and it does have that as well. This set is bright white light which seems to work the best for bias lighting. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!

"I LOVED this bottle. It's a great size and it fits in the car cup holder and it looks neat and it feels great to drink out of. However, it completely SHATTERED after a small fall. If you can guarantee that you'll never ever drop it, buy one. But if you're human, you should probably stick to metal bottles (plastic are bad for you).",0
"This knife sharpener is comparable to others that I've seen that are worth more than it. There is a buttoned plastic protector to protect the sharpener itself. I didn't read that it included it (maybe I missed it), so I was pleasantly surprised to see that. The grip handle seemed to fit well into my hand and gave me a good hold onto it. What really set this apart from other purchases was the seller. They sent me a follow up email to make sure that it was delivered and to see if I needed any assistance in case I wasn't satisfied with the order. I feel like they went above and beyond. I was given this product for a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion. In no way did this skew how I feel about this product.",1
These sheets are so comfortable and soft.  I love the way the brushed microfiber fabric feels on my skin.  Much softer than cotton plus they are not as warm as other sheets I have.  I used to use sheet straps to keep the sheets from coming off the mattress.  With the Empyrean sheets they come with one attached so I don't have to worry about the strap unhooking.  The color was true to the listing.  The pillow cases fit my bamboo pillow which are queen.  I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.,1

"These wheels are amazing!! I have a berber carpet under my desk instead of the traditional plastic floor mat because our upstairs office is all wood and the carpet helps with noise reduction. However, the carpet greatly hindered my chair's movement with the wheels that came on the chair, which was really beginning to irritate me. These wheels glide effortlessly across the carpet and have made a HUGE difference!!! They were easy to install - simply pull/pop off the old wheels and push the caster pin of these wheels in place until you here and/or feel them ""click."" The casters of these wheels spin 360 degrees, and the actual wheel and bearing are identical to roller blade wheels. The only other thing that I think is worth mentioning is that they did add about 1 inch of height to my chair compared to my original stock wheels. Great product!!

"I ordered this mouse for my Dell laptop running Windows 10 due to some issues with my touch pad.  It arrived on the date as promised and was easily installed in perfect working order.

I would definitely recommend both to anyone needing electronic supplies.",0
"I needed a strap for my yoga mat. Even if you carry it in the bag it needs some sort of strap to keep it taut.  Also there are times taht all I want to cary is my mat and towel. But then I end up having to add stretch bands and well you know it turns into a real hassle.  I like this band because it is two in one. It is a yoga mat strap with adjustable loops so will fit any size mat. It also is your stretching strap.

It is long enough to carry my mat any way I choose to carry it. Whether it be on my shoulder or on  my back, or at my side. This band works well for a stretch band to help with certain poses that you may need a strap for. I love things that have multiple uses.

"These are great ankle high socks made of 95% cotton. They are soft and comfortable and I like the grip pattern on the bottom of the socks. Those prevent slipping and sliding on non carpeted flooring, yoga mats, etc. This helps you maintain your positions when you aren't trying to hold on to the floor in your bare feet.

"I always wonder about jewelry when I purchase something that I cannot see in person. But upon receiving this bracelet it is exactly as you see it in the photos. I am an absolute fanatic about leather jewelry and this bracelet has not disappointed.

It is a combination of masculine and feminine. The leather gives it a manly look and just a little bling gives it a little feminine edge. I love the fact it is adjustable, so many leather bracelets are not and the fit is not always that good. It's light and comfortable. Another great thing about leather is you can stack the bracelets. Take your favorites and one a few at once or you even wear many at one time. You can always make a great fashion statement and mix and match a little different every day. Also with a brown leather color you can wear with almost any outfit you have. I wear leather everyday, it has become my own unique look.

I did receive this product at a discount for an honest review and I am so pleased! I originally bought it to give as a gift but I liked it so much I decided to keep for myself. Very well made and looks exactly like the photos. If you are into leather jewelry like I am, you will love it also.",1

"This apple cutter is 7.5"" all the way across and the actual part that cuts the apple is 3.5"" in diameter, and it has a hole in the middle for the core of the apple and then will cut the apple into 8 even slices. I tried this on a larger green granny smith apple. The apple cutter was large enough to begin cutting the apple however I had to push super hard and couldn't get it to cut through more than half of the apple and then gave up. Maybe the apple was harder than some or maybe I just wasn't strong enough. Either way I ended up cutting the rest of the apple with a regular knife. The slices are quite large. Although I would prefer the slices to be smaller it's really not a big problem for me. The blades were pretty sharp and began cutting into the apple fairly easy but I just couldn't get it more than halfway through. (Pictures included.) I think this would be best for cutting into fruits that are a little softer like a pear or mango, maybe even tomatoes. I will continue to use this and if I have any better success cutting apples I will update this review. Until then I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5.

7/24/2016 Update: I tried the apple slicer on a smaller red delicious apple and it went all the way through the apple fine. Still leaving my review at 4 stars instead of 5 because of the difficulty I had with the first apple. But since I have seen that it can actually go through an apple fairly easily I do have some hope in this apple slicer and corer. I will be updating this review again if I see any other changes with the product.",1

"This bag was originally intended to be for my husband, but once I saw it in person I had to keep it for myself! The pictures do not do this bag justice. In person, the fabric is soft yet very durable feeling. I was impressed with the quality of the metal handle at the top of the bag and the comfort of carrying it by that handle or the backpack straps. Right now, I'm using this bag as a ""diaper bag"" with my baby. Since it has two separate and sizable main pockets, I have assigned one side for my baby's items and the other side for my own items. The outside pocket is perfect for items I need quick access to like my phone and keys, although much more could definitely fit in this bag. It is also incredibly stylish and sleek. I would absolutely recommend this bag for any business professional and style conscious mom on the go, alike!

"This is a great quality case. It is not a soft, flimsy case, instead it is firm and protective. It has a magnetic closure so you don't have to worry about it always coming open on you. The case actually comes out a little bit bigger than the surface so this way it is protected in case you drop it. The part where the keyboard sits on is a fabric like material, this way the keyboard stays put and does not wiggle around. It also comes with a holder for the stylus pen which is very convenient.

"Goronya 3 Port input HDMI Switch is high quality HDMI switch and it is extremely useful for me. I always had problem with unplugging and plugging the HDMI devices because I have 4 HDMI devices (Chrome cast, Roku, Xbox 360 and android TV box) but the TV has only two HDMI ports. The 3 port HMDI switch works great and setup is very easy. With just one gentle press click, I am able to switch between the devices. I am using this device for past one week and this makes my life simple by avoiding unplugging/plugging the HDMI cable constantly. The HDMI cable is not very length but good enough to connect the HDMI switch with the TV port and other devices.

Things I like most
+ LED indicator to show which port is connected is very helpful feature
+ High quality build
+ Simple and easy to use
+ Fast switching between ports (It hardly takes a second to switch between HDMI devices)
+ No separate power is required

What could be better?
-The switch to toggle port is very small, could have been little bigger and smooth.
- Uni-direction toggle mode  If I want to switch to port 1 from port 2, I have to press the button twice before I can select port 2. This is not a big deal as it only take one extra press.

I have the iPhone, so please understand that my review is based around the ease of an iOS app download.

What I liked:  This is by far the easiest clock/alarm clock I have ever set.  There are no buttons to mess with to change the hour or the date.  You simply download the app sync clock for your respective app store.  You will need 2 AAA batteries so have those ready, youll want to get started.  Once you add the batteries and download the app, you place the clock right in the middle of your phone (with the app open) and hit the large button on the top.  The clock and the phone app will do all the work.  You have the ability to change the clock from a 12 hour or a 24 hour clock.  You have 2 alarm options that you set within the app itself.  You even have a place to be reminded of a birthdate.  The ease of this clock is amazing.  A child could easily set this up if they have their own phone.
The clock itself is nowhere near overwhelming in size.  In actuality, its very small.  This clock would allow for more space on a night stand than if you're using the old school alarm clock.  I LOVE that.

What I did not like:  The app page is large enough that you could have several more alarm settings.  Say another 2; a couple using the same clock might need 4 different alarm settings.  My suggestion is to update the app and allow more settings.

All in all, I love this sync clock.  By far, the easiest clock youll ever set.

I received this sync clock at a discount for my evaluation and an honest review.  I do not have any type of relationship with the seller or the manufacturer nor am I obligated to give it a certain amount of stars.  I am a gadget/tech freak and I would recommend this clock wholeheartedly.  At this time, I am giving it 5 stars.  Should my review change in the future, I will come back and update the review.",1

"It took me a bit of time to review this product in a way that I thought would be helpful to those of you making educated purchasing decisions. Let me begin by saying that I was offered this product for free/at a discount in exchange for an honest and accurate review of the item, and allow me to also explain that when it comes to watches, I only know about as much as the next guy. I expected to use this kit for changing straps and batteries, since that is about the extent of my watch repair know-how.

To start, lets discuss the quality of the tools and various components. After receiving this item, I changed three watch straps on various watches. I also opened one watch case, and separated/reassembled a chain link on a watch. Completing these tasks was fairly simple and all the tools performed well. I did have the spring bar tool snap on me after working on the third watch strap, however, this kit does include a replacement spring bar tool tip. It did not take much effort to snap the tip and I was a little surprised when it happened, but I swapped it with the spare tip and will certainly be more careful with my leverage in the future. Regarding the other tools, I have yet to use every single one of them extensively, but from my experience with most of them, and my visual inspection of each, they seem to be of decent quality. I wouldn't say the tools inspire you with confidence but I couldn't find any major faults in the construction or materials. The spring bar tool was the only tool I had issues with it, but keep in mind that this particular tool is a very thin piece of metal so be careful when you leverage it.

Next on to the actual assortment of tool. I included a picture of the instructional documentation that came with the kit and it lists all the various components. Feel free to take a look at the picture to get a better idea of the particular tools and their uses. I would say that the selection of tools is perfect for your average watch owner and the repairs that you would expect to be conducting. However, I will mention that the instructions aren't particularly useful. For example, the instructions have an image labeling which tool is the ""spring bar tool"" and then explains that this tool is for removing watch straps. It fails to explain how or given any further information. This is one of the major faults I have with the kit and thus knocks my review down to 4 stars. I think instructions are invaluable to consumers, and failure to provide such documentation is failure to provide a well-rounded product.

The case that stores all the various components is surprisingly a decent case that has little bands to secure all your tools. It is actually a hard case that opens like a book and has hard sides to further protect the tools inside! I really appreciate such a nice case being included. However, there are far too many tools to fit inside of this case and I would honestly say the most aggravating aspect of this kit is trying to fit everything back inside the actual case. I would appreciate if the manufacturer considered producing a larger case. No matter how you arrange the tools, it's just too tight of a fit. This doesn't impede the performance of the tools, but it certainly makes watch repairs slightly frustrating.

Overall, if you own more than a watch or two, or if your looking to replace some bands or batteries, this kit is certainly for you! It has all the tools that you would need for your average maintenance, repairs, and upgrades! For the price, you will be hard-pressed to beat this kit. You will notice trying to buy just a spring bar tool is nearly $10 on Amazon already. I would have given this kit 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of instructional material, and if the spring bar tool had performed better. But brushing those two minor faults aside, this kit is great for the money!

Leave a question if you have any and I will try my best to promptly answer them.

Best of luck to you with your watches! Be blessed!",1
The shoes were as expected and I have no complaints...,0
Works perfectly and very easy to program. The Genie dealer wanted twice as much for this opener.,0
"This dog clip on light is bright enough to see the dogs at night when they go to the far end of the yard. I purchased lights for the dogs because we live on a large lot by the river and the concern of wildlife. This way I can keep tabs on them while they run and play after dark. The clip is easy to clasp off and on to the dog color and the light is simple to turn on. Each of my dogs have a different color so I know who is where. The light is small and not much bigger than a strawberry. It is very bright but does not seem to bother the dogs at all.

"These shoes are so adorable.  My daughter really wanted a pair of rain boots. I saw these and just had to get them for her.  I was delighted when they arrived super fast because we have had so much rain here lately!  These are made of great quality and the colors are vibrant!  These are also very well packaged and the form is still perfect by the time it arrives.  My daughter was so happy when I gave these too e! er.  She loves shoes and it makes me so happy that I am able to proved her super cute shoes at a very affordable price!  I included pictures so that everyone can see that they arrived in perfect condition.  I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  My opinions are my own.
I tried these on just to check the size.  I also have a pair of rain boots that I ordered from Shoe Dazzle and these are a little smaller than them.  I suggest everyone to order a 1/2 size up.  I hope this was helpful.",1

The braids are very well threaded and sturdy. I'm excited to use. I'm used to old school plastic line that would break easy and you ended up loosing your catch. I live in FL so there are so many different options to catch.  I did receive this at a discount for my honest review.,1

Nice sharp scissors. Scissors are sharp with five blades on each sides. it comes with protective cover that doubles as scrapper to clean out the blades that has wet herb pieces clinging  on.  The hand grips  on the scissors comfortable and easy to move. considering it has 5 blades it is not heavy its feels just like regular scissors.  It also came with  2 small linen pouches to hold herbs. i have not used them.  so have no idea if it help keeps herbs fresh or not. I usually just store my herbs between two paper towels in my green glass container. This is great new tool for my kitchen since i love using fresh herbs in my cooking. it not the most necessary but it sure makes life little easier. I received discount on the product for honest opinion.,1
"If Grammy  can install this so can you.
With a little help from my Son , over the phone  I was able to set up the printer and install the wireless functions
My only difficulty was the ink cartridges as I wasn't familiar with this type and the diagrams weren't great.

The print is great and I was able to test it from both my laptop, computer desk top and tablet  Very Happy with my purchase.
BIG NOTE;  This printer DOES NOT have a SD MEMORY CARD SLOT.  even though the web site and the answered questions
say's it does.  What is does have is a usb port where you can connect a memory card for you pictures.",0

"I am a huge collector of organizational and storage supplies. I love anything that helps me keep things more organized and readily available, so this is a neat addition to my collection. The only thing is I wish it came in white. The material is thick and rubbery, and somewhat flexible. It's also a little on the heavy side, honestly, I wonder if this would last a long time if it had to hold a really heavy headset. But I'm using this for earbuds and hair ties, so I'm very happy with it.

I received a sample product for evaluation and review and am happy with this hanger. I only wish it was available in white.",1
"I've had this case in my iPhone 5s for a few days and I really love it. If I get a case that I don't like, I just can't keep it on and I go back to my old one. That has happened the last few times I tried another case but this time I love it! It isn't too bulky, which is a big thing for me. It's thin but rubbery so it still provides protection. I love that the front of the case has a raised lip so when you set your phone down it protects the screen. I even have one of those tempered glass screen protectors and the lip is still tall enough that it's protecting it.

So far all of my chargers have fit in this case and some of mine are not Apple ones. The cut outs are all perfect. Except I can't figure out what the point is on that little rectangle on the back bottom right side. No idea why that's there.

What I don't like about this case, besides the mystery cut-out on the back, is that at the very bottom of the back of the case, it is rouch where the purple diamond texture ends. So sometimes when I am holding the case, it feels a little rough on my hands. Not a huge deal, but that, combined with the mystery cut out, makes me take away 1 star.

The biggest thing for me with cases is if the buttons work well. These buttons work perfectly! All of them push very easily.

This is a great case that is really stylish, and functions as it should. I'm happy with this case and have been using it for 2 months now!

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I was not asked for a positive review, just an honest one.",1
"So I wear around 33-35 waist size, these fit fine as they have a bit of stretch.  Not to tight but comfortable.  Work well for both working out and daily wear.  Lightweight and super breathable.  I can't speak to the durability as I just recieved them and have only worn a few of them but they seem well built",0

"The hub came promptly on time which is a plus. The material build of the product is plastic and sort of cheap feeling. I do like the color combination of hub, black with the blue contrast looks nicely. The blue border around the buttons of the hub are not for design only. They emit a faint blue glue around the button to indicate when it is selected. The buttons seems tactile and responsive. They are spring assist meaning when you press down on one, to unselect it you just press it again and it pops slightly upwards. The button press is responsive with the light activation, and is really fluid. When you select the button and have a USB plugged into the hub, the color around the button lights up and only then does the USB get recognized by the computer.
Impressive. Really a neat way to multi-task with several USB connections. The read/write speed of the hub itself is alright. Plugging in USB 2.0 flash drive on a USB 3.0 port does bring the write speed down. The only thing that I don't think is set up in the firmware or controller on the hub is the capability of a safe eject method with the corresponding USB drives. Some drives are sensitive to just pulling out of the port and may become corrupt. I haven't tested this yet. I don't believe that pressing the button to ""disconnect"" the drive does a safe eject. Rather, it just cuts the signal for the input/output, meaning corruption on some drives may occur.",0
"This product is extremely well made. I placed it on my Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime and it fit extremely well. The cut outs for the camera where perfect and my front facing camera was not negatively impacted in any way. I am extremely thrilled about this because the front facing camera is an essential element of my cellphones day to day use.  Other people may say that these kinds of screen protectors lower the quality of the camera because they put a layer of the tempered glass over the front facing camera. I, on the other hand, did not find that this tempered glass screen protector lowered the quality of the camera. This is one of the few affordable tempered glass screen protector for this type of phone that has cut put made excellently! In addition, this product comes in a very sturdy box. This is comforting because it ensures the safety of the tempered glass that a plain paper casing. In addition within the box everything is neatly organized. The two tempered glass screens are separated and protected from one another. The company is also kind enough to provide a sufficient amount of wet and dry wipes, a micro fiber cloth , dust removal stickers, and a guide sticker to make the application process stress free and help you maintain a beautiful screen.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review and are extremely impressed with the quality!",1
Love these plants they are so neat and beautiful. This one is very healthy and would buy from the company again. I am going to have mine mounted on a board with Moss and hang it on my wall but they are nice in hanging pots also. I have wanted another one for a long time and finally found it on Amazon. Very easy to care for.,0
love this case...it's the best iphone/ipad case i have ever bought...and at a reasonable price,0
"For the price, these headphones are phenomenal, you can not find anything that compares. I originally had the LG Tone bluetooth headphones, which are fantastic, but also significantly more expensive and basically the same things. When those finally gave out on me--they lived a long and noble life--I used them all the time and was sad when they failed to work, but not ready to shell out the money for new ones. I found these, read some reviews, and decided to give them a try, accepting that there is always a risk with buying a less expensive version of an established product. These cost almost nothing, but have done their job well. It's hard to believe they are this good.

A few considerations...
-They can be used these for phone calls. People can hear you but you might sound like you are trying to reach them from Pluto. I use these primarily for media so it is cool.
-The battery life decent, somewhere around 5-6 hours, which initially I was very put off about. I found out they are quick to charge so I just plug them in when I am not using them. The headphones seem to fully charge in the space of a half hour or less, which is fantastic.
-You need to keep your phone close to you to maintain the connection. The range is not nearly as far as the the LG (which cost a whole bunch more than these). That doesn't bother me, though, because I generally keep my phone right with me regardless.
-They are significantly lighter-weight than my LG headphones were, which either indicates lesser quality or weights added to the LG headphones. In spite of that fact, they look great. I got the white and a pair of purple for my mother as a gift. Several folks have actually given me compliments on how cool they look!
-They have magnets that kind of hold them in place. Pretty good for storing but a bit less good if you are trying to wear them when you are being active. So don't wear them when you go mountain climbing.
In conclusion, for the cost, these are just a great buy. I use them for just about all sound on my phone since music quality on the phone isn't recording studio quality anyways. Buy these if you need an inexpensive wireless headphones that you won't care if they fall apart, get lost or some weirdo plucks the actual headphone earpieces off of the plastic neck thing.

"This is a nice-looking and convenient water bottle. I much prefer my water bottles made of glass than of plastic, both because it avoids the BPA and, for whatever reason, the water always seems to taste more fresh. This is borosilicate glass, too, which is much better at tolerating heat than standard glass, so it works great for tea and coffee as well as water. There's a handy insulating grip as well, so that you can carry it full of hot tea without getting burned.

It's got a wide mouth, so you can add fruit to your water (or your tea), if you like. The metallic cap is a nice feature, and screws on easily and tightly.

I normally don't like anything that has a prominent logo, but the ""ZAZ"" logo is fairly unobtrusive and simple and doesn't look bad. All in all I'm quite happy with this water bottle. (Sample provided for review.)",1
"I really like this case.  I love the color.  This case is very sturdy and it fits great. The cutouts are in the correct places. The rubber part is a little loose, so I wouldn't use just that part.

"I had the opportunity to purchase this umbrella at a discounted price in exchange for a trial and review. Overall, I have zero issues offering a 5 star review. The umbrella is highly functionable, ideal size, and a nice look. Single button open and close works great, keeping you from fumbling around when trying to get in your vehicle and out of the rain. Interior arms are well structured in a manner that should handle wind well. When completely closed, the umbrella is about 14"" in length. The only area for improvement would be a way to get the umbrella to completely collapse to its original position, however I'm not sure I've ever seen one with this ability. This is a great product and worth the money.",0
"I bought the size 28""-38"" girth harness for use on my Labrador, who is my mobility-assist service dog, and it fits him perfectly.  The quality of this product is unbelievable, especially given the low price.  The Velcro for the chest strap and the patches is super strong and the buckle is easy for me to clip and un-clip, even with very minimal strength in my hands.  I LOVE the locking feature on the buckle, which will prevent it from accidentally un-clipping when I'm using the harness as a grip for standing up or maintaining my balance, but allows for me to easily un-clip the buckle when it's time to take the harness off.  I also purchased separate ""In Training"" patches, because my dog hasn't completed his training yet.  I'm looking forward to many outings with my special helper looking handsome in his new vest.",0
"These curtains are a great buy for the price.  I got the charcoal color, and they look like more expensive curtains than they are.  They do the job of blacking out light very well and seem to insulate a bit as well (at least when it's warm out).  I'm not sure how they perform in the winter time, but either way, it's hard to go wrong with these.

I received this product at a discount in return for an unbiased and honest review.",1
These work great & have moved out the gophers & moles. If you have a building or post in the way it will not work through that area. Think before you place the device & it works great.,0

This is a very solid headlight that produces superb color quality and enlightens the work space very well. It is very comfortable to wear and adjust very well to the head. Batteries out of the box had already a good charge and I was able to use it as I was finishing my work in the garden. The tilt function is very handy and the fact that my hands are free yet I have light is superb. Cannot wait to use it for my next fishing trip. I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my honest review but i am sure I will be a returning customer. So far so good and worth the 5 star ratings in my opinion.,1
"This is a super cute case!  I love the trendy design and the color is exactly as described in the product description.  The fit is good but the cutouts are not aligned correctly.  Due to the incorrect alignment, my phone powers off or restarts because the side of the case is resting on half of the power button.  I love TPU cases because of their slim design.  I do not purchase them just for protection.  I love putting my phone in my pockets so it's easily accessible so I do not like like cases that add bulkiness to the my phone.  I love this color and design but I can no longer use it.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
"I had been looking for stainless steel studs and was very happy to find barbell style earrings because they don't have to be removed while sleeping.

I will purchase more. NOTE: I received these earrings free of charge from the seller for an honest product review.",1

"My husband is using this to workout and try to trim up his waist a bit.
He noticed a difference in size after just one workout session of two hours wearing this.  I noticed it too. It is hard to believe that it could be that fast but it noticeably looks smaller after having this on.
It is made well of fabric and rubber.  It can be difficult to get on.  It has hook and eye closures.
The outside of this is rubber.  High quality piece.

"After having the same screen savor on my phone for over a year, I figured it was time to get a new one. This screen protector is hard and does not flex. Putting this screen protector on is very simple and because of it not being flexible, does not get any bubbles!! Using my phone I do not even realize that I have a screen protector on it and all of my phone features work exactly the same as they did before. I love everything about this screen savor except that because you have the screen protector on, you have to press down a little deeper to click your home button. I am sure that this little thing does not mean much compared to how nice this screen protector has been.

"My wife is using this. It is very nice, and looks very stylish. The band is of decent quality, not the highest quality it could be; a bit light weight. The connection between the band and the Fitbit is a little loose on one side. Also, my wife had to remove a couple links, and that wasn't easy to do; it was a bit time consuming. One huge plus though was that bayite includes a tool to push the pins out and that is very good and works well enough. My wife wears her watches and by extension Fitbit a bit loose, so we can't tell you how if feels when its snug. But she likes how it feels very much with about a half inch of slack in the band. We were impressed with the nice packaging (see images).
We received this product at a discount for an unbiased review, but we would gladly pay full price; its worth it.",1
Great camera.  Get a quality micro-sdhc card and you will not be disappointed.  Get SDSQXNE-032G-GN6MA 32G about $16.  This camera will do 1080P 60 FPS with 0% errors at 39MBPS.  At 4K 30 FPS is may miss a frame or two but it not bad.  It may be the micro-sdhc cards fault.  A lesser quality card will only give you 720P at 30 FPS (MB-ME64DA/AM). The remote is a nice feature and works great.  Use the button twice to turn on and off a recording after the screen goes blank to save power. Press the button twice to take a picture if the screen is blank.  You will need to keep track of the screen sleep time in your head.  Just practice with the screen turned towards you.  If the screen is on you only need to press the button one time for video or pictures.  The power button only turns the camera off.  The range of the remote is pretty far.  The remote is probably only splash resistant so do not put it in the water.  The case is waterproof as advertised.  I store mine open as to not compress the gasket.  More to come.,0

I don't really think it is that great but it does what it says it can do (sort of). It is one of those things where you get what you pay for (for example the smaller screwdriver striped after I unscrewed 2 screws and the nail file started chipping at the ends after a few times that I hit the tool against the door when unlocking it).,0

"I absolutely love the wireless TREBLAB XR100 Bluetooth Earbuds for Sport Gym Running with 9 Hour Battery, microphone and noise cancelling.  Here are the reasons why.  First, the sound quality on these is amazing.  I have never used wireless Bluetooth earbuds prior to this and was very skeptical that the sound quality would be any good.  All of my doubts were removed after the initial used of these headphones.  I must mention however that I charge these for at least tent to twenty minutes before use, while I am getting ready for my workout.  I think this really helps keep the sound quality optimal.  Second, I love how easy these are to pair to your smart phone.  Within less than a minute, my phone found the earbuds and I was ready to go for a run.  It is as simple as turning on your Bluetooth on your phone, pressing the button on the earbuds then waiting a few seconds for the two devices to pair.  That is it.  Anyone can use these which make these also viable as a great gift.  I will totally buy a pair for my dad to use on his walks.  In addition, I love being able to answer a call while I have these earbuds on.  The person calling me has no trouble hearing me and it is super convenient to be able to hit answer on your phone without having to unplug your earbuds or place your phone on loud speaker.  These earbuds have absolutely changed my workout and running experience and I will never be able to live or work out with these again.  Everyone should own a pair of these earbuds.  Furthermore, the fit of these are absolutely amazing.  With other earbuds I experience slippage due to the sweat factor but with these I have not once experience any slippage or movement while running.  Overall, I would highly recommend these earbuds.  I cannot live without them.

"The beauty of this ring is in all the details. I love the vivid aqua blue of the stones. I think the combination of thin, delicate metalwork and black metal give this ring a vibe that's both girly and goth. I particularly like the openwork on the band.

The little flowers on each side of the center stone are my favorite detail. They're a lovely touch. That the smaller stones match the large one in color is perfect. I like that they're aqua instead of clear, because they're not as bright. That lends to the goth effect that draws me to this piece. The ring is well made and smooth, as well; I find it very comfortable to wear. It's a beautiful piece, altogether, and would look lovely on anyone.

I received this ring free to evaluate in exchange for my honest review. Any opinion I've expressed is purely mine and based on my own personal experience wearing this ring.",1

"Hey what can you say?  For the price this red/green dot works just fine.  I threw it on my ruger 10/22 charger takedown, which in case you don't know is chambered in .22.  Pretty sweet little setup.  The red/green dot came with several batteries, i think 6.  It installed on the picatinny rail just great.  Took just a few minutes.  The battery cover is sort of hard to screw back on once the battery is in because it sits on top of the part that you need to twist to select what brightness level of dot you want. Both the red and the green markers are clear with 5-level brightness adjustment. It has a nice cover to put over the glass.  somehow my glass is already scratched though.  It is not that big of a deal. It goes to show you that this is a cheap red dot. But what do you expect?  You are not paying much.  Anyways, it is pretty clear.  I personally prefer the red dot.  Its clear, and right when I put it on the gun the first shot was relatively accurate.  I did (obviously) have to do some tweaking but I got the thing shooting really well from about 25 yards.

I got the black grooved band and am very happy with it. It is a lighter ring than several other I have which i really like. I've got several different types of these and this one is my favorite.

"I purchased this MASS1 Mens stretch underwear for my husband. Let me start off by saying that my husband is picky when it comes to underwear.  He only likes briefs that are a spandex type blend and these met his requirements.

 These are definitely short-length and aren't as long as your normal briefs. He was a little nervous at first because he was worried that these would roll up. They don't roll up however they do move up a little, without riding up.

While unsure about the cellulose material, he was surprised how comfortable the material felt (silky.) The waist band is nice and tight without cutting into the skin or leaving any type of rash from rubbing. The band that surrounds the bottom of the legs are snug enough that it really does stop it from rolling up.

 We received a total of 4 pairs. The colors that we were given are blue, black, light grey and maroon (almost a purple color.) They were all placed inside a bag, but were all individually packed. Over all my husband really likes these briefs and believes that they are made of a good material and should last him for a long time.

"Unitek has made an incredible 6 port USB Charging Station port.  Mine is the purple and I love it.  I have enough usb ports for all of my needs.  There are different supply values for different devises, which is perfect for getting things to charge as quickly and efficiently as possible.  I love that it is like a power strip with a surge protector so that I know my devices will be highly protected and I don't have to worry about any damage due to power outages or things like that.  The port is very easy to use and works great.  I have not had any problems and have found no defects or flaws.  It is easy to plug in my USB's and they stay where I want them too.  This is a must accessory for anyone with electronics.  It would make a great gift or stocking stuffer.  My electronics charge very quickly and well.

I received this 6 port USB Charging Station Port at a promotional discount or for free in exchange for my fair, honest and unbiased review.",1

"This thing is very heavy duty. I expected it to be hefty but was blown away by it when it arrived. It looks like it would hold a ton. It comes complete with anchors for cement as well but mine is secured into joists in the basement. I have absolutely no fear of it failing. Just make sure to drill pilot holes first or the massive bolts will split the wood. I hung a 150 pound heavy bag from it and then put my 225 pound weight with it and there was not even a creak.  More than enough strength for suspension training it was purchased for. I was showing it off to a friend and he wants two to hang an indoor hammock. I would like another for a battle rope station mounted in the retaining wall. I highly recommend this mount!

I am aware some people disregard reviews from reviewers that received a discount because they think that the review is not genuine. I assure you this is not the case.

"I bought this ink to use in my Canon MG7120. I've always been skeptical on whether or not the ""generic"" inks would do as good of a job at printing as the name brand. While I haven't been able to use all the colors yet due to the fact I still have enough ink in some of the Canon ones, of the two colors I did try I was very happy with the results. I replaced my Cyan and Magenta with the EBBO brand ink and really couldn't tell the difference between the old colors and the new ones. I had printed out a test sheet with all the colors so I could do a comparison and was very pleased to see no significant difference between them. So far I would buy them again. I'll try to update this once my printer needs the other ink.

The only negative I have is I wish the EBBO brand had the gray ink that also goes with my printer.

"I have not used a tv antenna in probably 20 years. I have been a huge fan of directv or cable, but they have gotten so steep in price that I am looking for another solution for my television needs. It was suggested that people give a powered hdtv antennae a shot for your basic needs and use ad don apps for the other stuff like Netflix or prime shows. I placed this antenna in the attic and ran it to the tv. I Powered it up and could not believe the results.

The last time I used an antennae I literally got 4 stations and a couple were snowy, yes way before digital. This antenna picked up 24 hd channels. I could not believe I was getting this many stations from the air. Every local, along with locals I didn't know existed. A few are channels I paid for on DTV. Seriously! This is my first step to cutting out the crazy prices of cable or DTV.

As far as the products It comes with double sided stickers so that you can stick it onto the wall or wherever you need to. I noticed that like this one I was able to pick up more digital channels then the ones that are in my other room which are a little cheaper quality. It picked up just as much if not more channels of what is in our living room. You don't have to worry about having to pay an arm to watch local channels I am done with that.

For the channels that we get it is a great price overall. It's easy to install to any TV you have big or small. It has a long cord so you can adjust the antenna to the right position as needed from your TV. Overall it's a great product if I need to buy another antenna for our house I will be getting another one of these because of the price and quality of the product that you get. I recommend this product if you are looking at cutting costs.

I did receive this product discounted in exchange for posting my honest opinion, which is what I have provided. Rest assured that although a discount was provided, I did test out the product thoroughly and my review is honest and without bias. Reviewing (at least to me) is not to be taken lightly because I myself rely on reviews to determine whether or not to buy a product. I never review a product unless I have received and used it long enough to form an opinion.

I rely heavily on reviews, photos and experiences when I make my decision to buy a product online and I would never steer a friend wrong and I would never give kudos where it is not deserved. I am not desperate for discounts or freebies, so there is no motivation for me to write anything other than the truth. I have no obligation to provide a 5 star review, this is my honest review of the product based on my own personal experience. This being said, I found this product to be a great product and worth the money. I recommend them to anyone who needs it.

"I love these measuring cups and spoons. I like the colorful handles. I like that they come on a ring to keep them together. Which brings me to the only thing I don't like about them, the handle is so thick that they do not nest neatly within each other. But again the ring helps to keep them together. I absolutely love that the measurements are engraved on the handles. That means no wearing away over time. No guessing games when it's time to follow a recipe. This is very important to me as my current set of plastic measuring cups and spoons no longer have the amounts on them. The spatula and pastry brush, though on the smaller side, is a nice bonus.

"This shower head and filter is a great idea. It is made well.  There was no assembly.

I changed the shower head filter out in place of my old shower head.  Thete are different settings.  Which you control with a clear plastic button. This is hard to see on the shower head.

I tried the settings. They produce a lot of pressure.  So much that my shower curtain kept blowing in on me while taking a shower.

This would be a good filter if you have shower doors.  It does filter the water.  My skin wasn't dried out after taking a shower.  I received this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.",1

"These yoga shorts are so comfortable, and they look great on!! Some people stated that they were shorter than expected, but they were actually a perfect length to me, and this is coming from someone who never wears shorts outside of my home. They covered my belly fat, and have a little pocket compartment to keep my keys in if I'm at the gym. I'm about 5'7 and weigh about 190 lbs., I am a very curvy girl so I ordered the XL, and I'm very satisfied in how they fit. I highly recommend these for purchase, it's definitely worth the purchase.

"ThisTravelambo Magnetic Money Clip is so compact and definitely great for those who don't like carry bags and just want to stick their wallet in their pocket. I normally like to carrying small cross-body bags and a lot of my wallets are too bulky that it takes up the whole space of the bag and adds extra weight. This wallet is also great for those who don't like carrying coins around because there is no coin slot. I mainly use credit cards anyways, so this isn't really an issue for me. I just stick my cash in the money clip. I don't use cash much either, so it's not too inconvenient to keep pulling money out of the clip and sticking it back in. This wallet can hold up to 3 credit cards and an ID, which isn't enough for me because I have a couple of rewards card and gift cards that I like carrying around with me too. This forces me to down size what I carry with me, but thats not a bad thing because I will only carry the essentials.

"The transmitter is very easy to hook up.  You plug it into the car socket, pair your phone via Bluetooth (password maybe required), set your radio to a non-working station and you are done.  I was able to transmit music from my phone through this transmitter and listen through the car speakers.  Very useful when traveling between states and you don't have to search through local radio stations or mess with CDs.  Only thing is that the volume is on the low side.  I had to max the volume on my phone and transmitter to maximum and then the radio volume was pretty high before it was a normal listening volume.  Its easy to take a call and I was able to hear the caller clearly.  The caller informed me that they could hear me OK.  I sounded a little muffled.  Overall, I would recommend this product.

"This is a quality product from Aukey and works just as described. The wires are quite long and so is very useful. The 3 wires are of 4 feet each and  are thicker than the normal micro usb cables available in market and so will last a longer time. I used all the 3 cables and there has been no issues so far. Now a days every device is micro usb compatible and so any number of these cables will not be enough. It would be an added advantage if  a C type cable is also provided in this package. I give it a 5 rating as I could not find any issues with the contents in the package. Its just as described and also at a very reasonable price. The 24 month warranty shows the trust the company has on its products.

"I work in the middle of no-where and was excited to receive this FM antenna booster. We work out of a construction trailer with a car stereo installed in it and needed something to boost for some type of music. I had one of the guys at work install it. After he installed it, we did notice that we were getting more channels and a different variety, which made us very happy. He did have a little trouble installing it but once he figured it out it was good. We found less static and better clarity.

"I am pleasantly surprised at the quality and comfort of these Chinese shoes. I was looking for a replacement for an old pair of black flats I would wear with leggings to work during the spring. These canvas shoes fit my slightly wide feet perfectly, I am a woman but I used a sizing chart to convert to the men's sizes and it was right on the money. They are have a very clean look, nice vibrant black canvas and white sole. I definitely wouldn't be wearing these outside or on rainy days, but they are a great complement to some leggings on a lazy day around the house or to a casual indoor location.

"I, like many others are becoming very wary of using plastic for everything. I decided to switch out my plastic mixing & storage containers to either glass or stainless steel. I never realized exactly how much plastic I had until I emptied my kitchen cupboards! I was very happy I was given the opportunity to review these bowls at a slight discount in exchange for my honest review. It fell in to my lap at just the right time. After I ordered them, they arrived quickly and very well packaged to my home. The box they come in has a cute saying on it, I don't want to spoil the fun for anyone else so I won't divulge what it says :D However I will say they would also make a fabulous gift for anyone! The bowls themselves are very impressive to me. The bowls aren't light but they aren't overly heavy either. They have just enough weight that makes them exude quality. A nice touch is the rubber grip on the borrow of each individual bowl. That has changed my life! It grips well on to the counter top so while your mixing something, the bowl does not go flying off in the opposite direction or spilling. Even a hand mixer used with the bowls did not tip them over. I attribute it to the firm rubber grip on the bottom.

Another welcome touch is the small pour spout off the side of the top of each bowl. Got gravy & don't want to dirty another bowl to present it for serving? No problem! The pour spouts on the side/top make it easy! Not to mention each bowl comes with a thick rubberized feeling lid. I LOVE this option! I can  make something, serve it in the same bowl, then put the well fitted top on the bowl, put it in the fridge and I am done! High fives to whomever decided to design these bowls with both a top side pour spout AND well fitted lids as well! Each bowl also has a small handle on the side which has proved to be very handy to me. I can grasp the handle on the side to further keep the bowl steady while I'm mixing heavier food items like meatloaf or thick cake batter.

Clean up is as expected. I don't own a dishwasher so I can't honestly say how they fare in the dishwasher. However I can honestly say they are just like washing any other dishes. Hot soapy water, rinse, dry and done. I was actually surprised at how excited I would be over these stainless steel bowls. To me it is small, thoughtful additional that make a huge difference. I would highly recommend these to anyone really! I want another set for myself already. They come in fun colors for the lids and bottom grips and I love the colors are bright and bold but not garish in any way. I would think if your looking for a 1st kitchen set for your adult childs first apartment, newlyweds, or any family member upgrading or, like me, ridding my kitchen of traditional plastic for glass & stainless steel, these bowls are sure to be a huge, very welcome addition!",1

"These meal containers are a great size and they stack great. You can fit plenty of food and the raised lids allows you to fit taller foods like corn on the cob.
There is room in between the three compartments which is great for when I do meal prep. Sometimes I cook one part of the meal and stick it in the refrigerator and add other parts in later. Because the separate compartment doesn't share a wall I don't have to worry about the warm food heating up the other compartments.

The way the lids secure to the base is with little tabs spaced out around the edge that catch under the base. A couple of the lids don't snap on that well and the corner on the lid does pop open fairly easily. I bring these to work with me and I like to take the stairs so they move around in my bag some but I haven't had any problems with spills yet.

"I got these for my 7 year old daughter.
I will agree that they are vey cute sandles.
My daughter wears size 1s. I got size L 1/2  and thought forsure they would fit.
They are made really small, they won't even go all the way onto her foot.
I gave them to my niece who wears a size 11 and they did fit her, but she complained about them hurting her feet and only wore them for about 20 minutes before she kicked them off!
They do seem really hard and look and feel like they would be very uncomfortable.

Pros:
-Cute colors

Cons:
-Uncomfortable
-Made really small
-Hard

"I bought this protector for my husbands iPhone. I have one on my iPhone and so do my two girls. I paid twenty dollars for each one of them. The person at the store put them on and it looked pretty easy and straight forward. When my husband changed his protective case to a less durable case I thought I would save a trip to the store and save a little money in the process. I like that this is a tempered glass screen protector. It's very strong and holds up well to a beating. It fits an I phone 6s perfectly. You do have to make sure you have it centered on your phone or the sides may lift up. The package comes with the screen protector, a wet and a dry wipe to clean your phone with, a dust absorber sticker to remove dust from your screen before you try to place the screen protector and glide stickers. I had never used glide sticker before to help with the placement. They are a nice addition to help you get the screen protector in place before you place it onto your phone. I suggest sitting at a table or counter clear of clutter to install your protector. Clean the area if you can and make sure it is dry before you start. Take your time alining the protector and it will come out perfect, it's not really too hard to do. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. It took me only a few minutes to do and it turned out well.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. These are really nice leggings. They are capri style. The length goes just past the knee. These capri leggings are made of 95% cotton and 5% spandex. They are tagless. These leggings are very well made. They have an elastic waistband. They fit very snug. They are easy to put on and take off. They do not have the shiny spandex look to them. These legging are soft and comfortable. These capri leggings were very reasonably priced. I would recommend this product to a friend and relative.,1

"I expected there to be a way to change to frequency to somewhere where humans cant pick it up, but unfortunately the whistle is about as annoying as the barking can get, I have yet to find a frequency that I can not hear. I also did not receive the e-book that is described above so maybe Im missing something. This is not a whistle to instantly make your dogs quiet, but it works extremely well in training. I had a clicker before that I was using but this makes training easier now that I can have both of my hands free and give my pup dog hand signals. The whistle does work well for what it is and the pitch is easily changed by turning and changing the length of the instrument. The lanyard is also well made and is a nice length. Im not sure if my dog responds to a certain pitcher better, but he definitely can use it as a cue or reward noise very easily and picked up on it after using it in one training session. The whistle itself is made pretty sturdy and well put together, I believe that it will last for a real long time. Overall I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good quality training whistle that wants to work on some training sessions with their animals. It might take some patience or maybe even more than one session, but I believe this whistle could be used very effectively in training, for anything from obedience training, behavior curving, or just teaching some fun new tricks.

This screen protector is on of the best I have purchased it is already a little difficult to find protective accessories for my phone and I was able to purchase this one at a great discount so I was glad to find it.

"The manufacturer's sample received here for evaluation performed perfectly and in one way even better than expected. It's rated at 6 watts. Normally this would imply the equivalent of a 40 watt incandescent bulb but the actual output is rated the same as most 60 watt incandescent bulbs at 650 lumens. The color is warm white or about the same as that 60 watt incandescent. The manufacturer states its 2,700 k but it looks a bit cooler to me. If I had to guess, I'd put it about 3,300 k.

In proper use, this bulb runs cooler than conventional filament bulbs but remember, LED's do generate a good deal of heat which can be dispersed either through the base or by the air via convection / conduction. If you tightly enclose them, they'll overhead and burn out well in advance of their rated life. Note the illustration shows the bulb outside of any enclosure. This is the ideal way to use an LED bulb of 6 watts.

This bulb's rated life is 27,000 hours meaning you'll likely take it with you when you move.

Given the pleasant light output, instant on and long life, this type of bulb is probably the wave of the foreseeable future. Just remember not to enclose it tightly and you should be pleased with your purchase.",1
"Updated Review 2: The battery now lasts 40 minutes under heavy load. Save up for a better battery and skip this one.

Updated Review: This battery works but after just a few months the health decreases significantly under load. At 63 cycles, the health has gone down to 69% with heavy load on the computer. Without load, the health is usually around 85%, but then again the battery only has 63 cycles on it. I will be purchasing a different brand of battery when this one becomes unusable.

Original Review: After calibration and 6 battery cycles, the life has settled at about 94%, or 6500 / 6900 mah when fully charged. Although this isn't quite the same quality as getting an Apple brand replacement, it is 1/3 of the cost and does last a good amount longer than the 5 year old stock battery it replaced. It also came with 4 magnetic tipped screwdrivers which are actually very nice, I'll be using them as my primary computer repair screwdrivers from now on. I'll keep updating this review as the battery gets cycled more.",0

"I'm in the process of trying to get my 88 yr old father's home sold so he can move in with me... and lets just say he has a lot of...er.... ""stuff"". So I've been slowly sorting this ""stuff' into what will go with us and what we will sell before he moves. When I got a chance to check these out I jumped on them because we hope to be able to have the first sale very soon.

The signs are very well constructed. The 2 larger ones (18x24) are plenty big enough to be seen on a busier highway with a nice strip to write in details while the 2 smaller ones (12x18) are great for directing buyers in as they get closer to your location. The 4 mm plastic will stand up to the elements and the set should last us through all of our sales, including at least one at my place after we get my father to my place as we will be moving to a larger place together and I will be offloading stuff I don't need too!

The H-shaped wire stands are plenty hefty enough and should also stand up to wherever life throws them. You can put the signs onto them when needed and then take them apart as much as you need and they should still be usable after a number of uses.

I'll be adding photos once I get the garage sale organized.....

"This is a classy soft leather case that fits my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge perfectly. I love the natural brown color and the way it feels when I hold it. It has a little flap with a magnetic closure that holds the case closed and also can be used to hold it open. You can also fold the case so that it serves as a stand for the phone while in landscape mode. This is perfect for watching videos.

The case can serve as a wallet and has slots for ID, credit cards, and cash. This is a great idea if you don't like to carry anything but your phone with you. While I see the usefulness of this feature, I personally don't use the case for any of these things because, when it's open, all of those things are visible and easily accessible. I do realize that anyone could snatch my phone if it's left sitting out, but I am really paranoid about the idea of having my ID, credit cards, and cash equally vulnerable to theft and just won't do it.

The leather case protects my phone very well when it's closed. It's a littler scarier when I drop it while it's open, but so far there hasn't been any damage to it. The only issue I have with the case is when I need to use my phone's camera and have to let the open part hang down. If there were a second hole for the camera lens, this would be a perfect phone case for me, but I get how that would cause other issues with the wallet aspect of this case.

I cannot express enough how wonderful this leather phone case feels in my hand. The leather is soft and supple and it shows no sign of wear after daily use.

I received the phone case free in return for my honest review. My reviews are done in compliance with Amazon's TOS and FTC regulations, and I never guarantee a favorable review. I have personally tested this product.",1

Good sturdy hammock and you can't beat it for the price. Wanted a hammock to take backpacking and this fits the bill perfectly. I've already recommended it to friends and family. I received this product at a discount however this is my honest review.,1
"We love this water pot. Our first pot was really showing its age, so we were in the market to try something new....just could not decide. Then along came the deal of the day, and presto, we adopted this little gem. We love its many features, especially the temperature preset for the beverage of our choice. Highly recommend this to anyone....you will not b disappointed.",0
"These are great.  Your typical Tibetan prayer flags, brightly colored, screen printed, fluttering in the wind.  The only reason I gave four instead of five stars is  I thought I was getting fifty strands of flags...an incredible deal.  When I opened the package I found five strands of flags with ten individual flags per strands, hence 5o flags, but only 5 flag banners.  Overall they were  a good purchase, despite my initial confusion.

"I'm always missing an umbrella when I need it most.  I don't like to carry large umbrellas so if they don't fit nicely in one of my bags I don't take it.  This umbrella is of great quality, has a velcro closure over it, and the strap to wrap it back up after use is strong and holds the umbrella in.  The automatic button on the sturdy nice-looking handle is easy to use.  A simple push to open, a simple push to close.  The only thing you need to do is push down on the handle to minimize the umbrella.  Even after the umbrella has been opened the cover slides over easily to keep it compact and slide back in your bag until the next time you need it.

Fit my HP Envy perfectly. The original HP battery had been giving errors on boot up and would last only a few minutes on battery power. This replacement battery got rid of the boot up error and passes HP diagnostics. It seems to hold up well under battery only power.,0
"I'm a teacher and I plan on using these in the classroom for a few things: hall passes, filed trips, ""brag tags."" These are great for hall /bathroom passes. They seal up at the top so water won't ruin the tag I insert. The kids don't need to place it anywhere when they are in the restroom. Too often kids leave the bathroom pass in the bathroom. This way, they are wearing it around their neck so it won't get lost. The plastic is crystal clear and seems very durable. The tag swivels on the clip and the cord is a nice thick sturdy laynard so I don't feel these will break easily. These will work great in my classroom.

"I carry a water bottle with me at all times, all year long. Now that it's over the 100 mark here in southern NV it's even more important. I planned on using this holder to carry with me when going out, but when my hubby saw it he took it over. Whenever I go to the RV park membership pool he goes and takes photos in the RV park. Today when we left he had his water bottle in the holder, and he carried it around his neck the whole time taking photos, plus afterward when we went out to eat and then shopping. If I had known he was going to ""steal"" it I would have gotten a different color other than pink with a purple butterfly. :-)

The strap is adjustable so it could be worn over the shoulder or across the chest. The holder is stretchy so it actually fits a 3"" diameter water bottle; a little larger than the 2.75"" diameter recommended. The holder is also 8 1/2"" tall so it covers a tall bottle almost up to the lid. Being insulated helps keep the water cold and even as hot as it was today (105), he said it stayed cold for about an hour and a half and even when we got home the water was still a little cool.

"These ice molds are awesome!  Not only do my daughters get awesome icee treats, they get them in a really cool looking container.  They taste good and look good while enjoying their Popsicle.  At night my kids will get a treat if they've been good throughout the day and have taken care of their chores.  For a while, we've been giving them ice cream but I wanted to get out of that.  Switching over to Popsicle have been an awesome idea and they love them!

The Ice Pop molds are easy to fill and the caps are awesome and seal very tight.  One of my favorite parts about this is the fact that the lids cant get lost because they are attached to the bottoms!  I hate searching for lids!  The molds are rubber like and hold up pretty well.  My kids seem to bite down on them all the time without any issue.  Now I imagine over time the lip might start to wear down the more they use them but we've used this set 3 times already and love them!

I think you are getting a lot of scale for the money.
This comes with a rechargeable battery and a power cord. There are 8 memories so you can put in 8 different amounts for example, if you sell something at 6.99 a lb., 7.99 a lb., 8.99 a lb. You can easily recall each number when you go to use the scale so you don't have to put in the amount each time. If you use the scale on a sales counter, the amount can be seen from your side and the customers side. This scales holds up to 66lbs. and you can weigh in lbs. or kilograms.
The top is waterproof and is very easy to clean and sanitize. The legs are adjustable to make the scale level. It is recommended that you keep the scale away from corrosives and magnets.
In the pictures I weighed some cheese from the deli and the weight is close but not the same, I don't know which scale is wrong. I also weighed a ham, and once again the weight is off but is it my scale or the store's scale? Then I weighed a 1 lb. package of pre packages cheese with my old scale and my new one and they both weigh the same amount, 1 lb.
The scale lights up when you are using it and goes out after a few seconds of not using it although the scale does not turn off. This is a great battery extending features if you are running it on just battery. This does not connect to any type of computer.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. You can see from the pictures that this scale is accurate and does deserve a good rating.",1

"You will not have access to all the bells and whistles that would otherwise be available.  I have an LG phone, and cannot get an app that maps my routes.  Samsung shows that this is available with the built-in GPS, but I was told by a Samsung customer service agent -- only if you have a Samsung phone.

Other issues: the ""Floor"" counter (how many stairs you have climbed) is not accurate at all, and your steps don't seem to be counted unless your arm is moving.

I am hoping that 3rd party apps will become available as time goes on -- to fill in for the things that I am missing out on.

"These Moroccan globes are battery powered, but a lot smaller then I thought they would be. You need 3 AAA batteries and they last about 24 hours of constant use. At the end of the 24 hour period, they begin to flash and then slowly dim until they are totally out. The good thing about these being battery powered is that you don't have to worry about the plug not being compatible if you are buying it from another country. That is what I was worried about when I first ordered these. The outer shells are made of slightly hardened metal, maybe aluminum so it is less likely to be broken. The length is about the same as a normal string of American Christmas lights, about 5 feet. The original brightness of the lights are pretty dim, so don't expect a lot of light when stringing them up.

I received the string of globes for free for the sole purpose of reviewing them truthfully and without bias, which I have now done.",1
"I think this is a pretty cool digital TV antenna, which is replacing the traditional style. It's literally a sheet a plastic ( a little bigger than a letter size paper) with a cable attached to it.

"This review is for ProBreeze brand whisper technology electric humidifier.
 This is a small size for the area of a small room or a bathroom size.
 I have it in a sunroom or rather my craft room, LOL. There are lots of windows in my room so it gets a high amount of sun and also it is not as well insulated as the rest of the house.  It gets so hot even with the fan running on high and the air conditioning running throughout the house. This room just stays humid.
 I figured this might help because we have a high amount of humidity in the state we live in so anything dehumidifying sounded good!
 I turn this on and I have been running it about a week now.  I'm taking photographs to show you that it has collected about halfway filled with water. I really estimated that there would be more water in there, but I'm glad that it is doing its job and collecting the water.
 It does seem to make it easier to breathe in this room.  I also noticed that there is not nearly as much of a musty smell. Before, there was a must smell in the room. The dehumidifier has definitely helped with that.
 So far, I am happy with the results of the small machine.
 I can hear it running, but there is no annoying sound from it. I suppose that is what that was for technology is, LOL.
 Ive taken several photographs and tried to describe this product to the best of my knowledge.

"I ordered the REALTOR KEY LOCK BOX Safe Vault - Combination 4 Pin Lock - Wall Mounted for Maximum Security - Master Heavy Duty Slimline Keys Storage System by 321 Locks because I have two college age daughters who have twenty friends each that were using the code on the garage door open. I figured it out and I'm fairly certain close to 60+ people had access to my home.

I changed the code but the garage door code is a pain to keep changing (and lets hope the power doesn't go out) so I got the lock box and attached it to a steel in a convenient spot.  Lets face it, there are only so many hiding places you can tuck key that anyone cannot figure out. I can easily re-set the code if necessary on the lock box but it has really worked well so far. The cover protects it from the elements. Frankly, I am lucky nothing has happened and I should have gotten the 321 Lock sooner.

"I love these probiotics. I have a dog with inflammatory bowel disease, and its really hard on her digestive system. She has to be on steroids at least twice a week, which is also hard on her. But giving her any supplements is a gamble, because many kick off her IBD and then make things worse. These had no bad effects after the first couple of days, she always needs a few days to adjust. Spring is her worst time by far, and this spring she's been particularly bad. These have helped her for sure, they firmed up her stool and made her less gassy and uncomfortable. That made me very happy, because seeing her miserable makes me miserable. I'll definitely be buying more of these for her!

My other dog has had trouble with loose stool and being very gassy since she was a puppy, despite being healthy and on a high quality food. It has helped her some as well, and my nose is for sure thankful. These are great little treat like chews, that my dogs love to eat. .

I very highly recommend these for anyone with dogs that have digestive issues. They can also help with allergies. They arrived very quickly and well packaged, and are a great price.

"I live in Maine, and here in New England the mosquito are TERRIBLE! In fact, we joke that the mosquito should be the state bird of Maine. Our family loves to camp and hike, but sleeping outdoors is brutal with all the bugs. I've tried many different hiking hammocks and I have to say this one is definitely in the top 3. Not only is it easy to assemble, but it's also one of the most affordable hammocks of its type. I've paid more than triple this price for other hammocks in the past.
As I mentioned, it's easy to set up. All you have to do is find two trees (or you can use a stand if you have one) and secure the included straps. Then attach the hammock with the included carabiner clips. The only thing that disappointed me about this purchase is that it does not come with a rope or frame for the mosquito net. My husband is in the Army, so there is no lack of paracord around our home. I set this hammock up in our front yard and measured a piece of paracord to keep the net up. Then I just through the paracord in the convenient carrying bag that comes with this hammock. You could buy enough paracord to the job for under $10 or find something that you already have on hand to help suspend the net.
According to the company, this hammock can support upwards of 600 pounds. I'm not sure about that, but I tested it with my daughter, together we weigh about 190 pounds, and it held up just fine all night. Although, it wasn't very comfortable. I certainly wouldn't recommend this product for two people, even one is a child.

"I received our first pair of strides rites as hand me downs. They were a bit awkward in regards to color and design, and they didn't get used much. However, I was invited to a bzzagent campaign, which provided me with a free pair of stridew rites in exchange for our honest review.  We picked out these adorable boots that were extreme supportive, and the best pair of shows we owned as far as helping Penelope learn to walk. We the purchased 2 more pairs. Most recently, i was invited by bzzagent again to test out the srt line. We picked the dree sneakers. Walking has changed a lot from baby toddler, and these shoes are design for it.  They are flexible and breathable,  which are perfect for running,  climbing and jumping. There is a huge difference in her ability to freely play and be active when she has her stride rites on. I also buy the smart fit shoes from payless, mainly for chep, cute sandals, but i notice she trips more, and seems to get her feet stuck all the time. Granted,  Stride Rite is more expensive,  but i promise it is worth it. They offer specials on their website,  like free shipping,  and if you join the free rewards program, you can score deals like $10 off. When i ordered the free pair we were offer via bzzagent,  I also snagged some new boots for $8 (on clearance at $18, plus my $10 reward). If you have an active toddler, i cannot recommend these enough. #bzzagent #gotitfree #striderite",1
"I've had a few days to use this charging station and I'm already in love! Like many people, I own a ton of electronics. Some of them I charge every night and others get charged every few days. Many of my electronics have different cords, so I am constantly unplugging something so I can plug in something else. I can plug seven devices into this cool little charging station! It's fantastic!
I love the fact that I can plug in five USB cords with out the little plug bases. Both of my kids own several electronics and they always seems to be misplacing the little plug that goes onto the end of a USB to charge. Because I'm Mom, I usually give them one of mine, which leaves me short a plug base and once again switching cords so I can charge. With this charging station, I did not need the plug base, I can plug my USB right in and charge my stuff up! I'm really excited about this feature! Lol
There is also two outlets. This is great for the few electronics we own that have a regular charging cord. I did find the outlets to be a little tight, I had to push a little to get the plug into the outlet. I think this is just because they charging station is new and I think the outlets will loosen up a little once it's been used a few times.
There is a space between the USB slots and the outlets. My iPhone or my iPod can sit in this space while they charge. I did not have to take the case off, they just fit nicely in there. My kindle and my tablet did not fit into the slot, but that's not really a big deal. I like that the smaller electronics, like my phone, can fit in there.
I will be traveling a few times this summer and I am planning on taking this charging station. It is small enough that I can put it in my carry on When you wind up the cord, there is a piece of velcro that you can wrap around it to keep it neat. This is clearly a well designed charging station. I love that it can charge so many things at once. The plastic casing seems very sturdy and the cord is long and thick. I think this is a charger that will last a long time and be very handy to me. I am thrilled with this purchase and know I will get a lot of use out of it.

"These yoga blocks are a nice size (9x6x4) that are handy for a variety of exercises.  They are very firm but do compress a very slight amount.  They seem to compress about the same amount regardless of the amount of weight or pressure put on them.  This is probably about an 1/8th of an inch and makes them comfortable to use.  The beveled edges also add to the comfort or using them either when gripping around the edge of them or having a bare foot on the edge.  They stay in place fairly well on a wood floor or yoga mat, however I have experienced a little bit of sliding at more extreme angles.  They are easy to rinse off and dry off as they do not absorb any water.  I ordered these in the dark grey which is a perfect match for my Reehut yoga mat.

"Ill help you get a better idea of whether youd like the Holigoo wireless stereo headphones by going over build quality, battery life, daily performanc, sound quality, and several other details you might find helpful.
Whats in the box?
Inside the box youll find the headphones, ear tips in 3 sizes, a micro-usb charging cable, and a clip for adjusting the headphone cord length.
Build Quality:
When Id first started using the headphones Id thought everything was great. The wire connecting the ears is strong, the ear hooks are flexible and durable, and the buttons give a reassuring click when pressed. However, after a few days of use I discovered that a portion of the earphone section on either ear was a bit loose which was a bit disappointing for me, but after using a bit of gorilla glue the problem was completely solved. This might not be a problem for most people, but for me at least I found it worth mentioning.
Sound Quality:
For a headset priced at less than $25 these headphones perform extremely well. The average user should have no issue with this unit. Volume output is great, with a maximum thats enough to hurt your ears. Unless you're in a noisy or crowded area you won't need to turn it up past halfway (which is still pretty loud for most people using these). Going past 50% volume will also result in people being able to hear your music (at 50% someone else can hear it slightly and at 100% theyll be able to hear it clearly). Quality at lows, mid, and high all appear to be very consistent and good. Songs with base come through well on these headphones and genres ranging from EDM to Hip-Hop to Soca all sound very good.
Daily performance:
Pairing with a phone or laptop is easy and there isn't any lag between pressing the power or volume buttons and getting the desired response. The headphones fit well once put on. I wear glasses and can say theres a bit more adjustment needed. The headphones don't interfere much when you're in the gym or during jogging, so long as you put in the correct sized ear tips, otherwise the fit will be a bit loose. Also, I personally recommend not using the cord managing clip since it made it feel like the headphones were coming out whenever I turned or ran.
Battery:
Battery life on these headphones seems to be around the promised 8 hour mark. This is about 2 hours more than the average 6 hour mark promised for most wireless earphones. When the battery is really low youll hear a very frequent (around 30 seconds to 1 minute gap) warning. Charging takes about two hours.
Additional thoughts:
Being a person with really curly hair I find these headphones really useful because I don't have to worry about a huge dent mark in my hair after I finish using them.
Final thoughts:
Overall, I think the Holigoo Wireless Stereo headphones are a very good option for a great price. My only concern was with the build quality, although it may have just been my unit, but can otherwise be fixed easily with a bit of krazy glue or gorilla glue. I was sent this unit to review by Holigoo Direct and have only included my honest opinions.",1
"pretty cool item! i will definitely use it when i go on some runs in the winter. plays loud enough for you to hear but not loud enough to really bother people around you. I think this item is cool for people that enjoy running in the colder seasons.

"This is a great backpack for kids and adults alike. The black and white print is a funkier version of a zebra stripe and is very fun and contemporary. The hard shell makes me feel better about keeping my laptop in it -- feels very protected. There are some nice interior compartments good for staying organized, but also a good amount of open space. The zipper is sturdy and pulls smoothly. If this came in a smaller size it might work well for bicycle commuting. (I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.)",1

"I purchased the pink and white AqtivAqua Goggles for one of my daughters.  I'm very happy with my purchase and so is my daughter.

Here are some things I really like about these goggles:
--They are very well made.  They are airtight and there was no leaking or fogging of the lenses with use.  I was impressed with how well they sealed the water out.
--They look great!  My daughter feels like a million bucks in these.  They fit her face well and look amazing.
--The included case is really nice.  It's definitely a wonderful bonus.
--These have UV protection.  I really like this aspect of the goggles.  It's always good when a product offers even more than just the standard and the extra UV protection is definitely a great feature.

I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good pair of goggles and a quality case.

"I have been looking at high wasted swimsuits for a while now, but have been nervous to order one for fear that I wouldn't like it. When I saw this suit I knew I had to have it. The suit is well made and good quality. My only complaint is the bottoms are a little tight around my legs. It's not bad enough that I won't wear the suit but would have liked a tad bit more room. Over all I'm very happy with my purchase and would order it again.

"I'm not sure if I got a faulty one, but it does not keep my beverages or ice cold for long - and by that I mean no longer than a standard insulated mug (think: coffee). My friend has a yeti that will keep ice in its form overnight - this one will *maybe* keep it in its form for four hours or so...again, no different than a standard glass.. I wasn't impressed, but then again I could have gotten a faulty one. Word of caution..",0

"this is a great product ~ i was looking forward to giving it a try ~ but it was very difficult to get on my super thick california king memory foam mattress ~~ i'm sure it would be much easier to get on a regular mattress or a smaller size mattress that isn't so big and bulky ~~ we ended up giving up getting it on even with 4 people it was just too difficult.

"I bought this set just for the mixing bowls.  I'm glad I didn't have high hopes for the measuring cups and spoons.  I would have returned this item if I were expecting more out of them.
The measuring cups are not very good quality.  They are thin and flimsy and I won't be surprised when one of the handles fall off.  They are held together with a thin and too small key ring.  It is a pain to get any of the cups off the ring to use.
The measuring spoons are a little better quality than the cups.  They seem a little more durable but are also held together with the too small key ring.  The ring also isn't placed at the end of the handle, it's more towards the middle and just awkward.  There are also some sharp edges on some of the spoons, like the metal wasn't filed down enough.
The whisk might work okay for eggs.  It doesn't seem like it would work for anything too thick though.  I haven't tried it out yet.
The bowls were the only thing I am pleased with.  They aren't too heavy.  They seem durable.  They aren't very wide, but they are deep.  That is exactly what I was looking for in the bowls.
This set might be nice as a starter set.  It is not expensive.  But I definitely wouldn't buy this to give to someone else as a gift.

"This wallet is ideal for someone who is trying to keep themselves on a budget. It's great for 3 credit cards and your id along with a little cash. Once you put all the cards and id into the wallet it becomes very stiff so you can't really put much money into the middle part. But that can be a good thing. It fits in the pocket really well, although I do not suggest it due to the fact your could break your cards sitting on them.

"The case it perfect, I wish they made the same one for my other devices. It will prop up the device at any orientation (good if you like to lie on your side and read). It's well made, and fits perfectly. It wakes and puts the device to sleep exactly as it should. I'd bought one with a similar design that triggered the Kindle to go to sleep if the cover was folded back flat, which made it impossible to read while sitting up or on a train. I got a refund for that one, bought this one instead, and I'm very happy with it.",0

"I was so excited to receive my Kauai silicone ring!!

The ring came in a really nice ring box, very classy presentation.
I felt like I was really purchasing a nice product.  The ring was a perfect fit, and the rounded edge made it not only comfortable, but classy too.

I am a military soldier and having these rings allows me the opportunity to do my job in uniform, but also display my love for my spouse.  I also don't have to worry about the ring slipping off or getting lost.

The ring Stretches 10 Times Itself While Maintaining It's Original Shape And Size. Designed To Break Away At 43 Lbs. of pressure.
The Blend Of Silicone Used Will Withstand The Toughest Weather Conditions Without Cracking Or Drying Out. Heat Resistance Up To 400 Degrees Without Melting, Or Distorting its Shape.

"ROOP Monitoring Heart Rate is a pretty cool fitness band. I like how it monitor your heart rate with the sensor is has on the bottom. I bought it not for the heart rate sensor but to keep track of how many steps I take per day and to see how many calories I burn. For those two it does a great job. I also like it for the clock as well. The other reason I got it for is to alert me when I get phone call and txt message. I was only able to get the phone call alerts to work but not the txt message. I tried everything but still it won't alert me when I receive new txt message. I read somewhere that I might not work with IOS and that was a bummer. The app for the iPhone was great and very simple to navigate. I like the way the band looks and how it feels around your wrist. One thing I didn't like was that you had to take the screen from the band to charge. I also wish they would have made the charging connect magnetic instead clip on. Over all the band does what it said it does except for txt alert for me. Its also set at a good price that won't break the bank like the iwatch.

"Very happy with this set of glasses. I had Lasik surgery several years back which gave me 20/20 vision. The doctor warned me that as I age, I probably would need readers like someone with glasses might need to add bifocals because the muscles in the eyes don't work as well as you get older. He was right:-) I don't need a high magnification so far, but enough that I tend to squint and get a headache when trying to look at things that are close.

I think these glasses are fairly stylish, come in multiple colors to fit my mood or outfit and have spring hinges which make it easier for me to get on and off. My coworkers have complimented me on their appearance. The patterns on the side keep me from feeling like an ""old lady"", as my mother would say. They work as well as other, more expensive pairs that I've tried. I haven't noticed any distortion or other problems with the lenses.

I tend to be hard on them or lose them, which is another reason I like getting 4 pairs. I can leave a couple at work and a couple at home and then don't have to worry about carrying them with me. I crushed my last pair in my purse so I'm hoping I'll have these a lot longer.

"I think this trampoline is amazing! I had no trouble putting this together by myself, though having some help would have made the process easier. This was a birthday gift for my almost three year old daughter, and she loved it. She can both jump on it at the same time with one of her friends, which is a plus, but it is not so big that it takes up a lot of room. I like that it has a bar for kids to hold, as this trampoline seems best suited for very young children, ages 2 - 4. Although 5 year olds who visit have fun with it, I don't see it as something they would use often. But for three year olds it's great! I don't know how I would have found enough ways for my daughter to burn off energy when outside walks were impossible due to the extreme winters. He finds it especially fun to have peppy music playing and will go for 20 - 30 minutes. I have had it for a little while now and it is still in great shape. To me this is well worth the money.

We have her friends come over all the time and they love trying it out and jumping while they watch cartoons or even sometimes using it as a table to color. If you're considering buying it you should do it. Theyll love it as it is one of the best gifts Ive done in a while!

Exactly what I paid for.,0
"The Tasbel Cooking Thermometer was a little disappointing to me.  I had higher hopes because this is a tool I would use often and had hoped to replace my non-digital cooking thermometer with it.  More explanation in a moment...

First, on a positive note, the thermometer has a nice long probe which, in theory, would keep the person's hands away from the hot grill or stove top, yet provide an accurate reading.  The housing of the actual readout is plastic and felt a little flimsy - not so positive. The thermometer felt fairly balanced in my hand.

On a more disappointing note, the first thing I do when working with a cooking thermometer is to calibrate it.  To do this, I set a pot of water to boil to check at what temperature the probe would register in boiling water.  Please see pictures below.  I let the water come to a full rolling boil and inserted the probe.  The best read I could get was 201 degrees instead of the 212 degrees that it should have been.  Normally, I could just mentally note that I would have to adjust any measurement by 11 degrees, but... I could not get a consistent reading.  It would ready 201, then 195, then 199, then 193 etcetera.  This probe is not for anything that requires very accurate temperatures, such as candy making.

I realize this thermometer is not a candy making thermometer specifically, so perhaps that isn't fair.  I would not feel comfortable to use this probe to temp chicken or other foods where an undercooked temperature could cause a food borne illness.  The thermometer is great for foods where cooking temperatures are not a critical factor to the food safety or recipe success.

For the record, I received this thermometer at a greatly discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.  I have provided an unbiased review.  I do not receive financial compensation for my reviews and anyone is free to ask questions in relation to the product.  Many thanks for reading my review!",1

"My husband likes to birdwatch so I thought these would work perfectly for him. The binoculars comes with a cleaning cloth, instructions and its carring case, in which you can put it on your belt to carry it with you. They are not too big. As you can see in my pictures it fits in the palm of my hand. Easy to adjust. Has a string that you can put around your neck for easy access. In the description it says they have night vision but with low lighting not complete darkness. So practically what it's saying is if there's still light out you can see with it and if it's dark you can't. I was disappointed in that part. Was hoping for a full night vision binoculars but oh well, it still works good in the day.  I recieved this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.",1

"What a gorgeous shirt!  I ordered the Color 2229 of this Spikerking Women Long Section Short-sleeved T-shirt Dress for my mom and she absolutely loves it.  The teal color is very pretty and the flower design is just as pictured.

Its very well-made - no loose or hanging threads.  Its a thin material, but not at all see through and really soft and comfortable.  Its machine washable and dryable as well.  It also doesnt wrinkle easily, which is a huge plus.

Sizing - she is 5 6 and wears a size 8/10 and this one size fits all shirt fits her very well.  Its too short to be a dress, but it looks great with shorts or black tights, and can be dressed up or down depending on how you accessorize.

Thanks to the seller for providing this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.",1

"This is gorgeous, and creates a warm, inviting, and healing atmosphere in my house. The cut of this salt lamp is perfectly aesthetic, and artistic. The dimmer switch that accompanies the lamp is just perfect because you can change the intensity of the glow depending on the light in the room, and/or the mood you are seeking to complement. I love to look at it when writing and when meditating, and it also makes a great night light when dimmed. This would make an excellent, quality gift for people in your life. I want to have one of these in all of our bedrooms in the house, and in the living room and den, so I will be purchasing more, as well. I did purchase this product at a discount for purposes of providing an honest and unbiased review. If it was not a good product, I would tell you.

"I was surprised at the small size and the good build quality of this battery. I have a number of back up batteries that I keep scattered around my home and office and most of them don't look this good or have what this one offers, namely a digital numeric display of the power remaining in the battery. I'm used to just looking at a series of lights, that give you a rough approximation of the power remaining, but the Lizone battery tells you an exact numeric percentage. The built in flashlight is an added bonus, though one you probably won't use too often its nice when you need it. The pictures don't really give it any scale, the battery is small and fits easily in a pocket. Only a single USB output, but it's a 2.1A one so it should work with most phones, etc. The shiny ""piano black"" finish is a fingerprint magnet, but it's still nice. I'm pretty happy with this one.

Very nice and arrived quickly!,0
"First of all, this is described as having ""bright yellow flowers"".  No, they are not.  It is more of a butterscotch, orangish color and they aren't ""bright"".  The gray has a bit of a ""taupe"" to it as well.  And the size is ridiculous.  I have older mattresses in my spare rooms on both the full and queen beds. They are not deep mattresses by any means.  It barely covers the 8"" mattress on the full and no way does it cover the 7"" mattress on the queen.  If you pull the coverlet up to the top of the bed to cover the whole top it uncovers the bottom.  It is very, very light.  I didn't expect a heavy blanket, but this is exceptionally light. I have ordered a ""Madison"" set and a ""Greenland"" and they were much heavier and I could use either one on both beds with no problem.  In fact, the Greenland was enormous and practically fell to the floor on the sides when put on my queen bed.  And it was listed as a full/queen.  There were strings pulled on the pillow stitching. The pillow was actually the only cute thing about this set.  The picture doesn't really show you what this looks like.  There is quite a bit of plain white on the top half of the blanket.  The design doesn't go all the way up and just stops about a 1/3 of the way up the cover. All in all I didn't like it at all and sent it back.  Very disappointed.  That being said, if the colors were actually a nice light, bright yellow and the gray was a true gray, I might have kept it anyway for the full bed.  But they weren't.",0

YALUXE was formerly Yahoho and have updated their brand name. However, the quality and make of their items is the same as before and nothing is lacking in the quality aspects. I am one of those people who like an organized purse and to know where everything is from the day I change them out. This one has numerous pockets and compartments but not too many so I can easily remember and find where I placed everything.

The main compartment on top opens and closes with a metal zipper. There is a leather pull on it to make it easier to grab and unzip. Inside there is a large compartment for your items and also a few others. There is a small zipper compartment on the wall of one side and on the other side, there are 2 small pockets on the wall. One of those is a little larger than the other. You may be able to slide your phone into the larger one depending on the type and size of your phone which is a great place to keep it.

The next 2 zipper compartments under that one are just open storage areas with no additional pockets inside. These both also have metal zippers with leather pulls on them and all zippers open and close freely without any sticking at all. The whole purse is nicely lines with a fabric lining which is really a nice thickness. It's definitely durable and will last.

On the outside, you have one last zipper pocket on the one side which is metal with the leather zipper pull. This is a smaller pocket which works great for keeping your keys handy or your phone as well. This has a removable shoulder strap which is adjustable. It adjusts easily and will adjust to a length of around 47"" when extended fully. There are nice little clamps on the ends to hook onto the rings on the purse. They don't stick either and hold securely. The strap is long enough to carry as a crossbody too which I like to do from time to time. One thing I want to mention that I really liked about this purse strap compared to the many others that I own and use, is that this one is leather on 1 side and then a nylon on the other. I have noticed that with it being this way, it hardly ever slides off my shoulder where I have to place it back up there. The nylon kind of ""grips"" onto your clothing and isn't as slippery as the leather is. It's nice and flexible too.

The bottom is a flat bottom so when you set your purse down, it doesn't fall over or tip. Lastly, there is a small leather ""keychain"" attached on this which is removable. Basically it is of the leather that this purse is made of and same color. It is a genuine leather and you can use the key holder for holding like a spare house key or something light since it's just on one of those ball-type chains. Overall, I love this purse, the quality and the size. I am able to keep everything in it I want and still have a little bit of spare room. My husband always picks on me how heavy my purse is and how much I carry in it but this really does hold a lot. I would recommend this and love the pink color!

Good case for the 7 edge. I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review of the product.,1
I purchased this for my daughter who is really into photography. Although she is only 15 she has a small photo business of her own and therefor needs the right equipment to keep advancing her skills. She had been looking for a decent lens hood that she could use to cut down on glare. She does a lot of beach photos and outdoor shoots. Since we live in the south where the sun is very strong I thought this would come in handy. She really likes it. It is made of a fairly strong yet flexible material that goes easily onto the lens. It comes with a lens cap and a microfiber cleaning cloth. It is very convenient the way the lens hood flips and goes on your lens when not in use. It keeps the lens sturdy and somewhat protected and the lens cap even fits on when the lens hood is on. I think this was a very good purchase. My daughter is enjoying using it and getting some good results. I received this product at a discount or free of charge in exchange for an honest unbiased review. All of my reviews are 100 % mine good or bad. I depend on others reviews when  I purchase products therefor I strive to leave the best review I can.,1
"Yoga Meditation Cushion Zafu With Buckwheat Fill. Organic Cotton.
by Infinite Nature...

 If you are new to meditation as I am you probably have no idea what a Zafu is. Here is a quick little 101 Zafus - Creating Proper Posture Daily Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years in Eastern cultures as a means of finding truth and enlightenment. Today it has been picked up by many westerners as a means of relieving stress and strain in their daily lives. However, many westerners find the traditional lotus sitting position on the bare ground a bit too strenuous on their bottom and legs; therefore, the use of a zafu is recommended to provide greater comfort. A zafu is a name given to a special cushion you can sit on for meditating. They help you maintain the correct posture as well as provide comfort for your bottom during your session.

Meditation cushions provide needed support so your body can achieve the best and most healthy spinal alignment and posture possible. this cushion configures the spine according to the sitting posture of lotus, half-lotus or a kneeling posture. the practitioner learns to tuck in her lower back and to keep the spine in a straight line.

Curving out the upper back and gently tucking in the neck, with the head held as if balancing a book on top of the head, allows for the best posture. spinal stress is minimized and ones sitting sessions are more effective, reducing potential physical harm. after all, meditation is not supposed to be an endurance test and comfort is the key to a successful practice

This cushion is well made with amazing craftsmanship and comfort in mind. Zippered inner liner allows buckwheat removal so the cushion always fits you perfectly. Another great factor for choosing this cushion is that the fabric- both inner and outer liners, and the buckwheat used in this product is certified organic, which means that only nontoxic methods were used in growing, processing and harvesting.

Chewing with ease everything I throw at it at 1080p and 1440p (witcher 3, dark souls 3, rise of the tomb raider...) at more than 60fps. Super quiet with or without load (fans stay off when idle and even when gaming I can't hear them) and cool, haven't seen it go over 35C when idle (browsing in chrome, opening non-gaming software) or 70C while gaming and I live in south America without A/C  XD
Worth every penny.

"I received this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I received no other compensation.  All opinions are my own.  I ordered this item to share with my sister.  I'm not sure why but there's really only one outlet to plug anything in in her car so unfortunately if both of our phones die at the same time, we have to decide who needs their phone more.  Neither one of us ever want to sit with a dead phone as she has a husband and kids and I'm a very social person.  This eliminates the need to worry about that, which I am SO thankful for.  This is a dual charging car charger.  I was kind of surprised to see that this item has a micro USB already attached to it.  I'm not really sure that I like the fact that the cord is permanently attached.  If that cord would go bad it would make the whole thing pretty much useless to me.  Honestly wish it would have just had two separate ports to charge your phones and then just included the micro USB cord along with it.  However, I don't think I have to worry about this cord going bad too quickly, and therefore it's still very much worth every penny it costs.  This cord is made sturdy.  The wire part itself is pretty thick and nicely coated.  It just seems like it will stand quite a bit of abuse, which is really a nice thought as I get so tired of replacing items.  I'd also like to mention that Aukey does include a paper that tells you how to register your product for limited warranties, which is so nice.  I believe all Aukey products are like this which leads me to believe they really stand behind the quality of their products.  I am actually very happy with this purchase and would recommend to anyone who has the need for more than one charging port in their vehicle.  I know I, personally, am always charging something.  It's just something nice to have, especially if you frequently have guests in your vehicle.  Very nice little charger.",1
"Arrived on time, undamaged.",0
Excellent and good service.,0
Works exactly like it should. It's extremely convenient to travel with. I can't test the foreign parts since I'm in the US. But I've been using it for a week and it's perfect. Doesn't overheat. It's got all the conversion settings you need. It fits easily in the palm of your hand. You also have 2 USB ports so you only need this one charger. It comes with a case for convenient storage. *I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.,1
"Worked well in the beginning, no longer sticks to dashboard after a few weeks of using. Once placed on dashboard, never removed so the suction should still be strong. Disappointed and would not recommend.",0
"My yearly vow to include more fresh veg in our meals fell by the wayside in record time. I thought I might try to take advantage of some of the goodness at the farmer's market with this steamer basket.

The basket is made of thin stainless steel ""petals"" that expand out as far as your pot will allow, up to just short of 9 1/2"". It reaches the edges if all of my usual pots except for the stock pot. With steaming, there's no problem stacking a bunch of veggies on top of each other as long as the air can move around. The steamer folds down to a little over 5"" which is excellent for storage. The shape is awkward, however, so I'll be looking for a container to tuck it into long-term.

You remove the basket from your cooking put by way of a middle stake. My box contained an extra stake that just screws right in. I will be checking the tension on that screw  from time to time. Lifting a loaded basket this way is awkward -- I found myself removing most of the food with a big pair of tongs first.

The silicone ""feet"" on the bottom of the basket are nicer than some steamers because there's no worry that the feet will damage the non-stick finish on the pans. I do wish that they were just a bit taller. Having them short prevents me from adding too much water (and boiling, not steaming.) But when I have the pan heaped up, I have to take the lid off the pan to add more water -- losing a lot of thermal energy -- and ths steam in the process.

Overall, this is a good steamer, but is as some minor concerning areas, such as the length of the feet.

Do I recommend this item? Yes with some reservations.

"Ill admit that this is my first French Press, so I had no idea what to expect. I already have a Keurig and an espresso machine, so I didn't know what was going to be so different about a French Press. Let me just tell you that theres something about making coffee in a French Press that makes coffee taste so much better!

Why do I like this particular French Press?
1) Visually appealing - Its stylish so I can display it in my china cabinet.
2) Glass and Stainless Steel  Someone else reviewed that this is plastic, and it is definitely not! The glass and stainless steel kept the coffee hot until it was gone.
3) Taste of the coffee  just try it and youll understand. The taste of the coffee beans was unlike any other cup of coffee Ive ever had!
4) Easy to use and clean-up  The French Press was simple to use (after I knew how to use it) and after I was done enjoying my nice cup(s) of coffee, clean up was quick and easy.

One criticism would be that it lacked written directions. I know it comes with an ebook, but I like traditional directions that I can look at. I had to research how to use the French Press since I had never used one before. I still think this deserves 5 stars because of the look, taste, and quality of the product.

Hopefully my review is helpful! I did not receive any compensation for my review nor am I obligated to write a positive review. I, like others, depend on honest reviews for purchases I make on Amazon. I did receive this product at a discount rate for my honest, unbiased review and this is my honest opinion after testing the product. Thank you!",1
"This set of tweezers is a nice deal for the price. It comes with 6 different shapes/styles of tweezers, which are handy for crafting.

"This is the best bluetooth headset I have ever had. I love it! The ear pieces come out very easy for you to place into your ears. They are very comfortable and the headset it self sits comfortably around my neck and does not rub my skin to the point of irritation like some I have had in the past have done. Mute and answer button is right there on the side for quick answering of your phone or muting of your music. The ear pieces are retractable, be careful not to let the ear pieces snatch to quickly or to hard while retracting the earpieces though, I feel like this may cause damage to the ear piece line that runs into the main piece that sticks into your ear. It is very flexible and holds charge for a long time. I use it in the gym and I sweat a lot and so far it has not caused any issues with this product. I left it on one night after using it in the gym and forgot all about it and went to use it the next night and realized I did not turn it off. I decided to try and use it anyway and it still worked perfectly for the remainder of the night. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a high quality bluetooth product that will not let them down.

"This Binger Watch was a wonderful purchase. Its a beautiful watch. It fits very comfortably. My favorite feature is the clasp. Its a two sided push button that releases the clasp. No help needed. Its very elegant looking, yet looks great with casual wear as well. I have worn it with other bracelets on my arm and as a single piece. I really like the size of the face. The numbers are easy to read. The watch also has the date. I am totally satisfied with this beautiful watch.

"Overall I really like this product. I like being organized when I'm traveling or even for my different workout clothes that I keep in my vehicle.

Pros: Lightweight and nice sizes for carry-on luggage. I like how the bags can all be fitted into the largest size when it is not in use. Light flexible material makes it easy to fit in layers of clothes. I was surprised at how much clothes I could fit in one bag. The amount of pieces they give are just right for you shirts, jeans, shorts, etc. These five bags seem to fit perfectly into my average carry-on. Looks like they did their research.

Cons: The material is lightweight and does not quite hold a specific shape like a carry-on. Which may not necessarily be a bad thing. Only for those that like things to be a little more structurally rigid for packing. I am a little concerned on the material. Seems a little thin and I wonder how long they may last for someone that travels a lot and are constantly unzipping it.

In conclusion, I think this a great product. Good size and nice to pack. I would definitely buy more of these if I could.

"I am one of those guys who is always hot.  When other people are complaining about being cold, I want to crank up the air conditioning because I feel like I am baking.  My wife has even called me her personal radiator because I give off so much heat.  This is particularly a problem for me in my office where the thermostats appear to be nothing more than placebos put in place to make you feel like you can actually control the temperature.

The other day, she surprised me by plugging in the Set of 2 Mini Portable USB Fan by Generic while I was sitting at my laptop working from home.  WOW! Was I impressed!  The air power put out by this fan is amazingly strong and cooled me down relatively quickly.  The flexible design is also a great feature in that it allows you to position it pretty much any way you desire.  This is definitely a surprise for which I am grateful as I have been running it almost non-stop since she gave it to me!

I purchased the Set of 2 Mini Portable USB Fan by Generic at a discounted price in exchange for my fair and unbiased review.

"This product does exactly what it claims to do. I have used them to chop up a ton of vegetables and have yet to cut myself! The gloves fit perfectly according to the size guide that is in the pictures for this product. I got a medium and it fits nice and snug so it doesnt slide around on my hand and leave me prone to getting sliced with my sharp knives. The stitching and construction of these gloves is very high quality for the price and while I've only been using them for about a week now, they have shown no signs of falling apart anytime soon. Even when I accidentally slice the glove with my knives the glove doesnt seem to take any damage and no fraying occurs. I have yet to poke myself with the tips of knives when having the gloves on, and I don't think that this fabric will prevent a tip from stabbing through. It is more for preventing slicing with the sharp side of the blade. I have washed these in the wash a few times also and they have stood up to the washing machine no problem and come out good as new with all the vegetable juice cleaned out from the fabric. I will probably be picking up a few more pairs of these to give as gifts to the other clumsy cooks in my family.

"The car mount itself is actually quite tiny...roughly the size of a golf ball, but somewhat smaller. Pretty much the entire thing is made up of metal so there will be no worry of any pieces breaking off. The mount can be broken down into three pieces; the part that mounts to the dashboard, the part that the phone mounts to, and the magnetic piece that you adhere to the cell phone. The first piece is able to adhere to your dashboard via an adhesive tape that comes attached to it, and on the opposite end is a metal ball which is the male piece of the ball and socket setup of the car mount. The next piece is a metal socket that makes up the female end of the ball and socket setup. They are held together by a very strong magnetic bond, which allows for easy adjustments to be made without you having to worry about it falling apart. The third piece is the magnetic metal sleeve that gets adhered to your device via the same kind of adhesive tape as before. That piece is what attaches your phone to the actual mount via a magnetic bond. The end of the mount also has a rubber ring around it to keep it from scratching up your phone or phone case.

"I like this bag. It is a great size for a day out at the theme park or anywhere else where you will be walking around all day and don't want to be bothered with a big purse. I have an iPhone 6 Plus and it fits in this bag just fine.

PROS:
The liner is nice and thick. I can't tell you how important the liner of a bag is to me. If it is too thin it wears and tears quicker. Also, when the liner is too thin, you lose your small stuff at the bottom of the bag. It is hard to explain but I am sure you ladies know what I mean.

It seems to be well made. The zipper seems to be sturdy.

For being such a small bag, it has 4 separate pockets for easy organization.

CONS:

The packaging was super cheap looking. It came in a plastic bag and the first thing I thought of was one of those ""$10 and under"" stores where everything is displayed in plastic bins. The bag itself certainly doesn't look expensive, but I believe the packaging is important. It is what gives the consumer the first impression. I would definately not recommend this as a gift unless you plan on repackaging it.

Overall, I am pleased with this bag. I like small bags for certain occasions and I own a few that I love but they don't fit my iPhone 6 Plus. This is a practical item that isn't ugly so I am happy.

"I purchased the Ultimate Purple seat cushion for my husband, who is a rural carrier for the USPS. He delivers mail in the standard issue LLV (long life vehicle or mail truck depending on who you ask). My husband has issues with his back and previously had surgery for a herniated disc in his lower lumbar region. Fast forward to now and he has herniation again, along with nerve damage in his legs and feet. He has a large rural route, which takes him along some very bumpy dirt roads and the LLV seat has no shock absorption whatsoever.

After doing some research into the Purple mattress I was happy to see they also made seat cushions, so I bought one for my dad, who is a truck driver and one for my husband, who is a mailman. Amazon sent the wrong cushion initially, but I sent it back and they quickly replaced it for the Ultimate seat cushion. My husband was excited to get the mail that day! He immediately used the seat cushion in his LLV that day and has been using it ever since. It's amazing how something that seems so simple can upgrade your level of comfort instantly. He was bragging to his coworker, who is also a rural carrier about his new seat cushion, so today he decided he would leave the cushion in the LLV for his coworker to try when they switch shifts. I am happy to report that he also loves it!

The Ultimate Purple is pretty wide and perfect for the larger derri&egrave;re. If you have a smaller derri&egrave;re or seat width, I could also recommend the Double Purple, which is the cushion I purchased for my father. Just take a look at my Amazon reviews if you are interested in the Double Purple seat cushion. The Ultimate Purple is very comfortable and has helped immensely with the stiff ride, dirt roads, and long days of mail delivery. I would not be surprised to see an influx of orders for every model of the Purple seat cushions once the word of mouth gets out. I will say that I think the Purple seat cushions are priced pretty high, but you pay for a good solid product that is completely mobile, which allows you to upgrade just about any seat.

They also look like candles and they look like they have dripping wax down the side of each one.
There is also a setting for permanently on so if you do not want the flickering, then you can have it permanently on.
the light color is a yellow and you cannot change the color.
I have had them for about a week and the batteries have not faded. I thing that because they are LED, they should las a while.
They work on a small remote which allows you to adjust the brightness in solid mode and the brightness in flicker mode.

I often work on a cruise ship and the bigger threat is fire, so needles to say, open flames are forbidden. These make an excellent alternative.
Included are clips that was clip to a tablecloth and the candle fits in the top of it.
The fact that they work on batteries, makes them wind resistant as well.
 You do need to purchase 10 AA batteries because they are not included. The remotes battery is included.

Pros
Very realistic flicking light
Realistic looking
LED
Works with a remote
Table cloth clips included
Not a fire hazard

Cons
Batteries not included

The rubber pads on the bottom really help it from not sliding around, especially if I accidentally knock it when I reach for something nearby. It's made of aluminum alloy, not cheaply made at all.

It fits my biggest phone with no problems which I was relieved about because I like to play a couple of mobile games and sometimes, while my characters are building something or I'm waiting a while until I earn more game money to upgrade my gear- I will do things on the computer during that time, and instead of constantly having to pick my phone up to check it- I can now glance over to my phone on this holder and see when it's time to go back to the game.

It fits mine and my husband's smaller phones perfectly and also my tablet which is bigger than my biggest phone. I also like that I don't have to remove the phone's cover- it sits on this just fine with the cover on it. You can set your phone in landscape mode which is how I usually use it, or portrait mode. A product that is very simple- yes, but it is very useful and comes in handy, more than you'd realize. I'm really happy with it and can highly recommend it!

"I go on a lot of science expeditions, where we can't bring more than a single large 80lb pack, which includes our tent, sleeping bag, cold weather gear, and tools.  So everything personal has to be small, lightweight, and multi-use.  When there's no running water, baby wipes are your friend, but there are thousands of times when you just need to Wash. Your. Hands...... Which you can sorta manage with your water and a small towel---it's not great, but it's better than nothing.  That's why microfiber is important--it's light, packs down into a a small size, dries quickly, and is good at scrubbing skin.

FYI--If you're working in hot climates, you can use this as a cooling towel.  The microfiber has a lot of microscopic surface area, which allows more energetic water molecules to evaporate from the surface, leaving a cooler surface behind---that's the power of evaporative cooling!

I have the brown color, which I was offered as a promotional sample in exchange for an objective review, and  was initially apprehensive about the color because I didn't want it to disappear among similar earth-toned outdoor gear---but the good news is:  it's a much prettier color than it sounds.  It's actually a dusty rose brown, which means it's less likely to disappear on the floor of my tent.

Apart from the excellent sueded fabric, the other nice thing is that they imprinted the logo, rather than printing it.  So it's tone-on-tone, instead of glaring at you.  The edges are finished nicely in an almost-blanket-stitched fashion, so everything is neat and tidy.  This is a great, fuss-free, multi-purpose item to have in your tent  when you're camping, but I can also see it being useful around the kitchen, or even for drying wet doggy feet on soggy days.  I'm happy with these cloths, and they'll go with me out into the field.

---Promotional sample provided for the purpose of candid and objective review.---

Update Jul 1016:
These have performed so well out in the field (washing hands, wiping down mirrors, cleaning optics, cooling towel) that I came back and got more in the most high-visibility shade available.  The blue ones are even better because you can see them in a dark backpack, or in the dim lighting of your tent.

The fabric is unlike any of my other microfiber towels---it really is suede-like, which is good because unlike the microfiber towels with the longer pile, these don't trap small specks of hard debris that could scratch your equipment.",1
"So far, I love it. For the price, you cannot beat it. I should of done this sooner, as my old mattress was over ten years old..
The bed is firm mattress with a slightly padded top. For me this is perfect as I like to sleep on my stomach.
I was able to get it in the house myself and set it up in ten minutes. I waited the recommended forty-eight hours before I slept on it. It had a slight odor on day one but disappeared by the time it was to sleep on.
I recommend getting deep tuck sheets- the bed does expand to the twelve inches.",0
"I did not know something like this existed.  Using this product, instead of letting my old tv collect just, I can use it with newer software such as PS4, Chromecast, Xbox, and more.  It also comes with instructions making it even easier to use.  All one has to do is put in the hdmi wire from their device to the box and then use AV wires to connect the box to the tv.  It is that easy! The converter box is also really small making it easy to store!

"Surprisingly larger than I expected it to be. I was able to fit a decent amount of items inside and it wasn't hard on the shoulder either. The material seems easy enough to clean and doesnt seem to retain water when I carry it in the rain, though I didn't let it sit in the rain to test it. I do have to say I didn't like the material flaps that sat at the ends of the zippers, I felt that they were a little unnecessary and the bag does make a little more noise than I would like. I don't believe that those 2 things would make this go below 5 stars though. I love that it can fold up smaller when empty and closes that size with a button. Also love that it can with the extra little handbag that have several compartments.

"I put this bra on and it is like heaven. It is seamless, soft, comfortable and supportive..it stretches as I grow. l like the material the bra is made out of. The soft material easily moves out of the way for easy access, yet the bra is still firm enough to provide great support.

Exactly what I needed. I have other waist bags but I purchase this one because I can put my water bottle in it.

"Review from husband as the S5 active phone owner:
This phone case was packaged well, nothing damaged or missing.  Its very similar to the Otter Box Defender series, but with a much more palatable price point.  Weight increase is negligible, I like the fact they include a screen protector, to me its value added.

The case is 3 parts, the inner silicone sleeve, the outer poly-carbonate hard shell and the rotating belt clip.  The sleeve and outer shell went on easily and fit snugly.  All the button offsets lined up and worked well.  I particularly like the stand although it is a bit of a chore to open, the angle it presents while the stand is deployed is perfect for table top viewing of videos, gaming, or reading.  I found the added thickness of the phone with the case on to be very comfortable and natural feeling in my hand.  Holding the phone while talking gave me a secure feeling that I do not necessarily get while using the phone sans case.  The phone fits well in the belt clip, it does not feel like it will just fall out, yet can be easily removed for quick access.  I typically do not use these but this one felt sturdy and well-constructed.

Overall I like this case, the mix of the silicone and poly-carbonate allows it to slip easily in and out of my pocket which is where I predominantly keep my phone so accessibility is important to me.  I rated this case a solid 4 stars, its a good value and Id recommend it.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it is similar to so many other cases and honestly I need to be wowed before I give 5.

"I bought this LG K7 / Tribute 5 Screen Protector, SOOYO(TM) Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector (2.5D Round Edge/99% Clarity/Shatter-Proof/Bubble Free) for LG K7 / LG Tribute 5 [Lifetime Warranty]-[1Pack] for use to protect my HLG Tribute 5 phone screen. I love that the screen protector came with such handy tools to clean the screen protector before placing the tempered glass protector on the phone.  I do wish it came with stickers for installing the phone protector to make sure the tempered glass is aligned perfectly on the phone, as I have received those stickers with other phone protectors in the past.  Instead I carefully had to align the screen protector with my hands holding the tempered glass around the edge and drop it into place which worked just fine. I was able to use the phone immediately after install as nothing needed to dry or anything. I was easily able to make the screen protector bubble free with the use of a credit card.  A square card did not come with the protector to get out bubbles. The installation process was relatively easy and painless. The phone still works just as smoothly and has the same function as it did before without the screen protector. The screen protector does get some fingerprints after a while just like any screen protector will but one quick wipe from a cotton cloth makes it like new. Tempered glass is the absolute best for protecting the phone screen from getting damaged.  My biggest issue with this screen protector is that it would not adhere to the phone around the curved glass edges of the LG Tribute 5 so it looks like a the protector is coming off all around the edges.  Due to this main reason, I gave this product 3 stars.

I have attached a picture of the phone protector box as it came out of the packaging. It looks wonderful and exactly like the product listing. The quality of the phone protector seems great after a week of use. This phone protector is really functional and I am fine with my purchase but would have chosen a screen protector that fit my phone better had I known.

They can be tricky to fill on your own and I had to have help but that isn't a design flaw, to be expected with this type of thing.  I'm sure there are ways I'll figure out to make it easier.  We made homemade ""Go-Gurt"" to put in them and my daughter loves it.  So much healthier than store bought and much more cost effective.  Can't wait to experiment using these pouches more.  So far they are easy to clean but I could see there being trouble with them completely drying on the inside so we will see how that goes as we use them more.  Overall, very pleased with this purchase.",0
What a cute leash for my precious girl! I have a cocker spaniel that I ordered this for. It is very well made and super cute!  It is 4 ft long and has a swivel latch that is easy to hook to collar.  The handle or grip of the leash is made of neoprene and feels great on your hand! No more burn on your hand if your dog decides to pull. I feel confident using this with my dog. I love it so much I  have actually ordered the harness to match! I am very appreciative to have received this product for free or at a discounted rate in return for my honest and unbiased review. I know how much I rely on other people's reviews to decide whether or not to make a purchase. I hope this review has been helpful to you in deciding.  Buy with confidence!  This is a great leash!,1

This is a very good leaf net or silt rake.  It looks just like the picture and is very heavy duty.  The netting is very strong and so is the frame.  It seems like it's going to be indestructible.  I use it more in the fall and spring when I have a lot of leaves and twigs falling from my trees.  I have a lot of trees.  The rake net holds a lot of leaves and even picks it up off the bottom of the pool if it is slid under the leaves.  It seems like it will last forever but at least I know it will be replaced if it doesn't!,0
great product quick shipping,0
Would have been a 5 star if the seller would only check their product before shipping.  One of the part which attached to the screen is loose so I have to be careful not to move my screen unintentionally if not the screen would tip over.  The other arm work well. I can imagine if both was working well this would be a good item.  I wrote to the seller and the offered to change the product BUT I have brought this overseas.  It works but not as well as it should. SO FRUSTRATING.,0
"I love these ring.  I usually wear a titanium band but any time I am doing any work with my hands I end up with huge calluses all over my hands from where the titanium band rubs them.  This ring corrects that.  The silicone is really soft and stretchy.  It is probably the most comfortable ring that I have ever worn.  I wasn't sure how nice this was going to look when i purchased it, but it looks so nice.  I have been known to wear this as my daily ring sometimes. It looks that nice.  The black almost looks like metal.  The band stretches about 3 or 4 times its size.  I ordered a size 9 and I normally wear a size 9 ring.  This ring fits exactly the same way as my titanium band size 9.  The only problem I have ever had with these rings is when I get sweaty the ring is really hard to take off because of the silicone.  I don't believe that is a con for this product though.

"I am a jewelry  fanatic and all of my friends know this.  They are always checking to see which piece of jewelry I am wearing.  The day this arrived, we had dinner reservations with friends at Disney.  When arrived at the resort to check in for our reservations, the two ladies at the hostess counter could not stop raving about what a beautiful necklace I was wearing.  The necklace comes in a small black pouch inside a small black box with Caperci written on the top.  The chain is sterling silver and 17 inches in length. There is a 2 inch extender at the end that allows 19 inches for the chain, should you want.  There is enough space to remove the chain if you had a longer chain on which you might wanted to try the pendant. The heart is a Large Blue SWAROVSKI ELEMENTS Crystal that has 3 rows of cubic zirconia diamonds draped across it  The blue crystal is 1 inch in length a just over 1 inch wide.  I cant stress enough the beauty of this necklace, photos in my opinion do not do it justice.  This would be a great gift for a girlfriend, daughter, or wife for any special occasion.

The battery definitely lasts for days which is far superior to any other models on the market. And the rechargeable aspect is wonderful. I have 2 dogs and the collar worked great on my year old lab mix and not so great on my stubborn Weimaraner.

"So we've been looking at getting a little stockpile going for the next time we might have a hurricane come through and I came across these. This particular company's products were one of the reasonably priced options for the size you get, and they offered a HUGE amount of flavors. I decided to try the Pasta Alfredo and I am pleasantly surprised by it.

The flavor is surprisingly good. You can definitely tell that this isn't the same thing you would make at home, but its certainly far from the worst thing I've tried as well. The sauce was thick, the noodles were good, the seasoning in here was good. Not too bland, not too spicy. It was surprising considering it came from a bag and has a 25 year shelf life.

My only issue is how long it takes for it to cook. Boiling it for 15-20 minutes is kind of a pain if you are taking this with you for camping, or if you are using this because you are out of power. I do understand the trade of though of the longer shelf life. I saw that this has to be SUPER dehydrated to get that long shelf life, and since they don't use artificial ingredients and preservatives, thats just what you give up. Its not a big deal, but some may find it to be a hassle.

Speaking of ingredients, I was also really surprised at the nutrition facts and ingredients for this. This has a lot of carbs per serving, so if you are taking this camping or hiking, you would really need those carbs for fuel, but it also has a fair amount of protein per serving, which is important because it keeps you feeling full. So I think they found a good balance with this. I love that there are no bad ingredients and that this is made in the USA. Thats ALWAYS a bonus. Overall, I'm super pleased that we gave this a try, and I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors as well.

"This Prestige Home Fashion Wide Width Thermal Insulated Blackout Curtain - Antique Bronze Grommet Top - Chocolate in Color is just what I needed for my large double windows in my bedroom.  The sun comes up on that side of the house and beams through that window and heats the entire room up in no time and my husband and I wake up hot.  Now that I have these blackout curtains by Prestige Home Fashion the result is the room is staying much cooler now, thank goodness.  Not only are the benefits from these curtains a plus, but they are also very luxurious and beautiful.  The Antique Bronze Grommets are a elegant touch and also make it very simple and easy to put the curtain on the rod, my husband and I had them hung up in no time.  They were a little wrinkled from the packaging, but inside was a paper that stated to put them in the dryer with a damp cloth for a few minutes and the wrinkles come out and I did just as it instructed and the wrinkles did come right out.  These curtains are thick and heavy duty, but at the same time very elegant.  The curtains are very soft, such as a silky feel.  They are simple gorgeous and do exactly what they are designed to do.  My camera does not do them justice, but the room is so dark, I couldn't really get a good lighting exposure while taking the picture.  I highly recommend these to anyone one that is trying to keep the bright sun out of there face while sleeping, these are great for 2nd and 3rd shift workers, so that they can get good quality sleep.

"I don't like the design. It as long as your typical TV remote control, and definitely wouldn't fit inside a pocket properly. I'd prefer the Anker Astro E5.",0
I have a couple of these and they work great. The o-ring seals well so you don't have to crank the lid shut(i think thats how people are breaking it). Its also easy to spin the lid on and off with one hand. It says its for 25lbs but my dog food is 33lbs and it just fits. No smelly plastic and keeps the dog food air tight and fresh. Made in the USA makes it even better.,0
"It has taken me a long time and a lot of wireless speakers to find a better sounding speaker than my Arespark Bluetooth speaker that has been my favorite for some time now but this is now my new favorite speaker (sound wise) with my Arespark one being a close second and here is why.
This sharkk  25 W Bluetooth speaker sounds amazing. The sound quality coming from this guy is super clear with a great range in tone. It does not sound Boxy at all and has a nice sounding base to it also. It also connected and reconnected very easily to my iPhone and iPad.
In the description this speaker is powered by three 18650 batteries however there is no way to open up the speaker to get to these batteries to replace them. It would've been nice if there was a way that you could replace these because I have many of these batteries laying around for flashlights and what not. The speaker should last most of the day at half volume with these batteries and that is pretty loud if indoors. Outdoors I found myself turning the volume almost all the way up.
When I purchased the speaker the description said it would come with a charging dock however it did not. The speaker is rechargeable with the cord that came with it but it would've been nice if you could charge it with the standard micro USB like most other devices.  The dock is apparently is not available for purchase at this time. I do see the seller fixed this in the description and not sure how one reviewer received one but this should be cleared up a little better by the seller for future customers.
The speaker is about three times the size of my 7w Arespark speaker ( please see the photo comparison below) and the sound is definitely better than it but not a super Huge difference in sound quality or volume. It is definitely loud enough for me but since this speaker is 25w I was surprised that it wasn't much louder than my 7 W speaker.
The speaker has an auxiliary input and an output however there isn't any other inputs. It would've been nice if there was a slot for a microSD card so you didn't have to use a device to play music.
There is a USB port but it is 5v output for charging Devices which is nice if you need to charge your phone in a pinch kind of like a battery back up.
Also this speaker is not water resistant or waterproof so you have to be sure not to get it wet when using it outside.
One awesome feature is the thermal sensor that lights the keys up when your hand gets close to the buttons on top.
On top there is a power button, track up, track down, Pause/play, Bluetooth button, volume up, and volume down. It is nice that this has separate volume buttons.
Overall the sound quality on the speaker is amazing and I would highly recommend it to anyone for sure but If you want something smaller and more portable,has an SD card slot, water resistant and cheaper I would go with the Arespark.

"Purchased this flashlight for my husband, who likes to keep a flashlight handy in his travel bag.  He is very impressed with it, likes the feel, and the amount of light it produces.  This is not a lightweight flashlight, weigh about 15 oz. so if you are close to your allowable weight in your suitcase, this may put you over the limit.  But I think the size is perfect as my husband has not really liked most of the small flashlights I have purchased in the past for him, he immediately put this one in his travel bag. The amount of light it puts out is amazing, no more fumbling in the dark when he is trying to locate anything.  The main reason I purchased it was because of the strobe light, in the off chance someone tried to enter his hotel room he has a method to disorient them.

"I work in sales selling Flower vases. This was exactly what I needed. We have vases manufactured overseas so the make the molds in mm instead of inches. Some customer will ask for the exact measurements of the outside and normally we just round off the quarter inches when we post a listing and also for our catalogs. Now we are able to get an exact measurement for them.  I like the fact that we can also measure the inside diameter as well because our glass is pretty thick.

This is very easy to use and super accurate. I have only had to zero it once! It has been accurate ever since that time.

"The other reviews had me worried about this product, but my own experience has been much different than most who have reviewed before me. I've been using this unit for over a month now. I make at least one shake or juice a day and have had nothing but good results. This small unit is very powerful and thoroughly mixes my items up into a perfect texture. I like using spinach, avacodo, strawberries, and various coconut milks to make my shakes. I love the shakes! They make me feel great and taste very good. I like that this unit is small and super easy to use. I prep my bottle and add the lid with the blade and just mix away. Clean up is simple and the bottles are well made and easy for me to take to the gym or wherever I'm headed. I hope that my mixer doesn't break like some others have because it really is a very useful device in my home.

"I had been considering one of those tower adapters for my desk to get a few plugs and allow me to charge multiple USB items at the same time.  I have a couple of other methods I have been using for charging and this is easily the best.  In the past I have tried USB hubs, USB hubs with separate power sources mult-port wall adapters, outlets with USB ports and numerous single port USB adapters, and even smaller travel versions of this type of device. They all have various uses but this is definitely the one you want for desktop use.

First the general layout.  It sits flat on the desk and has enough mass to keep it in place and nice clean lines and a crisp white color.  It does have a light blue indicator light on top so you know its powered up (it retains its glow for up to a couple of minutes after power is off if nothing is using it) and while it does glow through the center USB ports it is not annoying at all in a completely darkened room. The cable is very thick and has good strain relief at both ends with a sturdy 3 prong plug with excellent finger grip built in for easy unpluging and can put the device about 4' away from the outlet and if its closer there is a white velcro cord wrap to keep it tidy. The on off switch is next to the plug on the end. It is nice and flat and squared off as it sits on the desk and offers better support to AC adapters than some of the domed or rounded off version I have tried, but it also has rounded corners along the sides that look very good and the only style lines that will attract dust are the very faint bands that give each gang of 2 outlets a separate appearance.  The QICENT logo and brand silk screened on top are very discrete.

On the business end the 6 3 prong outlets on top are oriented with the grounds toward the inside which give a much cleaner appearance and are spaced far enough apart for all my larger plugs and most of the smaller AC adapters.  The truly epic sized wall warts will still take up more than one plug, out of the ones I have I would say its about 50-50 but most of those that are modern fit fine.  The USB selection is where it really shines 6 ports spaced far enough apart for any of the cables I have and even most of the devices with integrated plugs without interference and they are all rated at 2.4amps. According to the label it has a total of 40watts available which so far has been plenty for me, the most I have had plugged in is 3 devices that charge fine on 1amp and 2 phones which require higher capacity and no problems whatsoever.

Honestly I can't think of anything to fault this device so far. Like other modern surge protectors that I have there is no separate indicator light or fuse so there are no visible indicators of it working, however my old surge protector which never tripped and just failed on the surge protected never indicated a fault, they also often only offered partial protection. This also doesn't have any provision on the bottom for surface mounting, but again, I have never used it in any other power strip.  I honestly love this device and it has allowed me to greatly de-clutter my desk which is awesome, I would highly recommend it.

"Love my thermos and use it everyday.  However, my husband's was ruined when he put it in the sink that was filled with dish water.  Water got into it somehow and We can't open it to let it dry out.  The water splashes around in it.  Threw it away - didn't want anything to grow in it.

I don't soak mine in water so I'm not sure if it's a common problem.  Way too expensive for that to happen though.  Won't buy again.",0

"We have been keeping this rodent trap very hot for the last two weeks because they are baling the hay behind our house and all the field mice are running to safety. And that safety just so happens to be my garage! I wanted to catch them before they had a chance to make it into the house again so I ordered this trap. I don't like using poison because I have little dogs that could somehow accidently find it and ingest it. I've lost track at how many we've caught in this trap but it's close to 20. Each time I just put a little peanut butter (works way better than cheese because it's a stronger odor) as bait and turn it on. Sometimes we can no more get back in the house and sit down and the beeping noise sounds letting us know it's time to clean it out again after a casualty. I knew we were getting a lot of the little critters in the garage but I had no idea we had this many! I am using it plugged in because batteries are so expensive and this thing is working so hard. But I would imagine if I wanted to place it in the house under a cabinet or something for reassurance the trap would work just as well with batteries.

"This is the first hands free leash that I have used, but have been wanting to try it out for a while.  I received this leash in exchange for an honest review, so this seemed like the perfect time to try one out.  I have had the leash for a few weeks and have used it almost daily since receiving it while walking with my very ""adventurous"" dog.  He loves it, I love it!  It is very sturdy and handles his darting out to chase a squirrel or other such interloper.  These side adventures are also no problem for me.  I was afraid that if he decided to give chase that it would knock me off my feet.  No problem.  Generally he walks calmly beside me.  At times he likes to lead the way.  This leash handles both positions well.  The bungee type cord also gives him some leeway without it being unruly.  We have not yet tried running or biking with it, but that is next.  The waist band is adjustable, so will comfortably fit many.  I really cannot think of a ""con"" for this leash.  You will definitely be satisfied with this leash.",1
"When I first saw this I thought no way would it work very well at all because this thing is tiny. Shortly after inspecting it a little more and then using it the first time did I realize size doesn't matter when it comes to this camping stove.

 This comes in a small plastic case that you could easily fit in a pocket of your hiking bag or even the pocket in your pants. After getting it out of it's case you can extend the arms that the pot sits on and attach the fuel source.

 I love that you don't need anything like a lighter or matches to light this because it comes with an automatic ignition already attached. This ignition works GREAT and lit the fuel with just one click every single time I used it. The flame is even adjustable so you get just the right amount of heat.

 This is great for campers, hikers, or for those that like to be prepared for emergencies. Since it is so compact it will fit in your bag without taking up much needed room.

 I received this camping stove for free for reviewing purposes. My review is based on my own personal use and opinions.",1

"These boots are really cool. Both boots have pockets that go all the to the way to the buckle in the back. They are thin, so they won't fit a wallet or a key chain, so I would suggest using a Baggie or small bag to store things before putting them in your boots. The boots are stylish, and fit true to size or somewhat large. I ordered a 9 and wished I ordered an 8.5. I lke how they lace up and have the side zipper for easy on/off. The only negative is the zipper for wearing (not for storing) is plastic and cheap feeling. I'm not sure how long it will last. However, I am very happy with this boots! Love them!

  As soon as I received this butane torch lighter I was excited to try it out. It was beautifully packaged.  I love to solder sterling silver, copper & brass together to make beautiful jewelry.  First of all, it didn't come with any instructions what so ever.  I do know how to fill a torch due to having others before this one.  So I filled the lighter up with Butane, pressed the red igniter button and......not a darn thing.  No flame, spark, nada!  Unlike my other torches this one doesn't have a sliding switch for the flow control.  I found something underneath the handle where you fill it with butane that looks like a battery compartment opening that you would use a coin to turn it.  There is a + & -, but it didn't do anything upon turning it.  The handle is made to look like a chrome metal, but it is just plastic.
  I received this FOGO butane torch lighter free or at a discount for a truthful, honest and unbiased review of the product I am testing.

"Obligatory disclaimer: I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review.

Reader disclaimer: I normally do reviews in a pro/con format, but this product literally left me with no cons to talk about. The material is very sturdy and offers plenty of protection. The pattern is aethestically pleasing while at the same time contributing to the overall effect of the product. I don't anticipate the clear parts yellowing in the future like most clear plastic things.

I will say that it does take some effort to get the case onto the phone, but after it's on you won't have to worry about it falling off or anything; it's a very snug fit and once you realize the fit is perfect and button placement is perfect, etc.... You won't want to take it off anyway.

"Pros:
+ Highly effective
+ Shrinks swollen pores
+ Controls oil
+ Easy to use
+ Guaranteed
Cons:
 - Application has a learning curve
This is one of the most effective acne treatments. You dip a cotton swab into the bottom of the bottle, hold for a second, and proceed to dab every imperfection in sight.  If a zit is fully developed, expect a 30 to 50% reduction overnight.  If you apply as soon as acne begins to appear, it can reverse it and clear the pore altogether.  If you're like me, you'll probably need 2 to 3 Q tips to treat your face.  Each swab covers 4 to 5 spots. Highly recommended

"Oh gosh! I love this cozy one piece outfit. Very warm and fuzzy, I have washed it and it holds up well without shrinking. I was a bit dubious at first as to whether the size would fit but it fits me fine, top and bottom. Hubby got the biggest kick out of them, says I looked like a pink kitty..lol. I think that they will be perfect for the cold winter months coming here in northern Wisconsin. They only bad part is you have to take them off completely to use the bathroom. Not so bad if you can wear a shirt underneath which is what I will most likely be doing. Gets kind of chilly in our house.
So if you will be ordering a pair, you can order the size you usually wear and it should fit pretty good.

"This is a lightweight, nice looking robe. The fit is as expected, and it is is a nice length (just above the knees, I'm 5' 3"" and got the small). The quality overall is great, there's no loose threads and the stitching is solid. Visually it's appealing and exceeded my expectations - it's not overly shiny or cheap-looking. I ordered the dark purple, but received the lavender - no biggie, it's still quite pretty.

The fabric wasn't as cool to the touch as I'd hoped, and may be too warm (which I guess isn't entirely unexpected for 100% polyester) for hot summer days. Because the fabric is smooth, the robe tends not to stay tied very tightly, and I find myself needing to re-tie it quite often.

Overall, I do like this robe.

I have to say I love this calendar sticker!  Our family needed something that would help us all stay on track with appts. and this is perfect.  I stuck it right to the front of my fridge and got myself a couple chalk markers to write with.  It's really cute!,0
I ordered these for the shape and the fact they were BPA free. When I received them nowhere did the package or product actually say BPA free so I don't think they are. The shape is good.,1

"For starters, this is a cute dress! The material feels kind of cheap but what else did I expect? The sleeves definitely are not 3/4 sleeves and are full length. They should probably update that little detail. I was worried about the sizing and normally wear a size 14 in women's clothing but this dress (in size large) was big on me. I should have ordered a medium, for sure. The overall design is cute and simple, the neckline is just right and doesn't go down too low, and the length is exactly where I wanted it to hit (I'm 5'6""). It's a lightweight material that seems perfect for any season and I didn't find it to be see through. I received this dress at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review but this had no impact on my opinion.",1
Great Protection device. I put it on my nieces tablet and it's really done a good job. My niece had broken two tablets but this one is still in perfect condition because of this great case. I would definitely recommend it to others to buy for their kids. Great :),0
"I have recently acquired a small wallet that zips, ID sized... And had decided that while I do like it, for cash and my everyday cards I really prefer the design of a traditional long wallet.

Then I was offered the opportunity to test and review this wallet and thought Perfect! I'll give it a shot. (edited: However, at the time this wallet was NOT priced at over a hundred dollars. So my rating is based on a MUCH lower price point. At any price it is a very nice, quality wallet, but there's no way I'd pay that much for a wallet, for me or anyone else.)

(That said, here's what I like about it:) It comes in beautiful vibrant colors, and it has ample room inside for the cards I use regularly. I don't carry a check book any more, but it offers a space for that, and a slot with clear plastic over it for my license. I LOVE that it has a leather flap over this clear slot which hides my ID when I don't need it to be seen. Very nice feature.

The zippered portion for change is quite sufficient in size. I really adore the deep pink shade. The leather it is made from is solid feeling and stiff, not overly soft but not at all unpleasant feeling.

A silly thing but one which really impressed me nonetheless is the gift box it arrived in. The wallet came wrapped in a bright orange poly-fabric pouch, enclosed in a beautiful bright orange box. Really lovely presentation, and if you are buying a wallet as a gift this is a big plus in my opinion. Little touches matter.

The only thing I'm not sure I like is the way it closes, a little belt-like flap. It works well, it holds it shut, and it allows for expansion, plus it is simple to open and close, and in the end I may love it. I just don't know yet!! It is unfamiliar to me and I need to try it a bit to decide. I have only used my wallet for one day, so I will update after more use.

All in all, I'd easily recommend this wallet for yourself or someone else. (See photos) HOWEVER...( I've found I need to edit this review after viewing the offering)... my rating of five stars WOULD be affected by price. I'd pay $20 and love it. I'd pay $30 and like it. Maybe. More than that, and I'd probably skip it, but it IS leather and nicely made.

I was given a free (or heavily discounted) sample of this product to test and review, but have offered only my own opinions and observations. If, after continued use, I find myself less satisfied with this piece, I will update my review and explain why.",1
"Love love love this case. My interest was sparked after hearing the Kardashians rave about this case, so naturally I had to purchase it as well. Kind of bulky and thick but the lights work great and make my pictures look so much better. Super fast shipping! Awesome product!",0
I live in the deep south so solar anything is a good bet for us.  With summer coming on I will be using my Rand Solar cooking tube to keep from heating the house up.  3 of these little pans fit perfectly into the cooker.  I was using the tin foil throwaways but wanted something more permanent. This was the answer.  The specific pans that can be bought for the Rand are running $50 with shipping so this was a big bargain with the same results.,0

 It slices very very thin and it dices and minces an onion with no problems at all, I have been using this knife for a few days so I can not tell you how well it will hold its edge, but it is Damascus steel and I had other Damascus steel knives and they held there edge with proper care longer than knives, I have that cost more. I will update if this one loses its edge. Now proper care, is very important you always want to clean the knife as soon as you are done using it, dry it and put it back in the box. I would NEVER put this knife or any quality knife in a dishwasher, yes I'm sure it is safe to do so, but with any good quality knife the less they are bumped and rub against any hard surfaces or other tableware the better. The fastest way to dull a good knife is to put it in a dishwasher. As soon as I get done using my knives I hand wash and dry and put them away in my knife holder, so that they are not touching or bumping against each other. Mine is a roll up holder. So no metal on metal.
 Always use the knife on a cutting board, either plastic or wood, this keeps the knife from cutting the surface you are cutting on, and helps  keep the knife sharp.
 Over all I really like this knife it is my new go to for tomatoes and this summer will get a work out when my tomato plants start producing, it will be fried green tomatoes then on to salsa and finally canning season. With proper care this should hold its edge for months.
 I like the way it feels in my hand it has good balance.  A good addition to your collection, by the way you can never have to many knives or kitchen gadgets. I can not wait till the garden is producing this will see major use with onions, peppers, cucumbers and tomato. This is a good choice it will become your go to knife at meal time. It has already become my vegetable go to knife.

PROS
Damascus Steel
Well balanced
Good edge
Full Tang
Sheath
Tip guard

CONS
None but I will update at the end of gardening season, if needed.

This is a beautiful picture which matches my living room decor perfectly.  I need to knock off one star as this is not worth the 45 bucks...there are other canvas' which are larger and just as nice for less..  This is an honest and genuine review for which I DID NOT receive any free products of discounts.,1
This case is very handsome to look at and has a feel of elegance when is on your phone and in your hand. Does not add bulk to your phone but does give it adequate protection. With a slightly raised lip on the front it protects the glass screen front. After using this product for about a week I'm very satisfied with it and have not noticed any cracking or peeling. It seems to be very well made and was easy to install.,0
"The 5-port EZOPower USB wall charger is truly a must have! We all have that felling where we have too many devices to charge but not enough electrical outlets to charge them and we simply do want a power strip either. This product has a built in surge protector to protect your devices from power surges.  This is great when traveling and you don't need to pack all of those wall chargers with you. Simply pack the EZOPower wall charger and go about your travels knowing you have one device that can charge up to five of your devices at the same time. This device is very compact and does not take very much room on my desk. This device also has two super charge ports for faster charging of devices.  I'm impressed with how well such a  small device is able to do it all without much heat coming off the device. I'm telling all my friends and family about this product!

"I received this dress this week along with a few other items and tried it on as soon as I could. It is true to color, and a very lightweight knit.  I typically wear an XL after having lost over 50 pounds (and still working to lose more!), but for this dress, after having a sizing issue previously because I had missed seeing the seller's size chart, I recommend reviewing the sizing chart carefully, I had to bump it up significantly to fit to my measurements. Review the size chart provided by this seller carefully. It is not the Amazon chart that is automatically linked to clothing, but the chart to the left with the photos of the item.

Other than the sizing issue, and the fact that it is a very lightweight knit, this is a great summer dress. It is sleeveless but will not require special undergarments. It is a tad long on me (Im 57), but my summer stacked sandals (about an inch and a half tall) will make it the perfect length for me! I really like the stripes in it  although I had concerns about them before trying it on.  I will also say that it is my practice to wash my clothes in cold water (unless their usage or other circumstances necessitate hot water), and then hang them to dry. As this is a cotton knit garment, I would seriously urge you to do likewise. I would definitely wash this dress in cold/cool water and hang to dry for best results, no shrinkage, etc.

PROS:
True to color
No special type of bra required
Very comfortable
Lightweight knit
The photos depict the actual garment quite well
The sleeve and neck holes are nicely bound with a knit bias tape and look very nice.

CONS:
The Amazon sizing is not correct for this garment  be sure to check the sellers size chart inserted with the photos. This is NOT sized according to American size norms (if you are in America, if not, that may not apply for you!).
Personally, I strongly recommend cold water wash, hang to dry  that is my norm, but for you, that may be contrary to what you usually do.
Mine was a little long, but the right shoes will fix that!

CONCLUSION:
Again, I must reiterate: the Amazon sizing is not correct for this garment  be sure to check the sellers size chart inserted with the photos. Especially in light of that, personally, I strongly recommend cold water wash, hang to dry  that is my norm, but for you, that may be contrary to what you usually do. Otherwise, this is a lovely lightweight knit, with true colors to what I saw on my computer screen. I got the black/grey stripe and love it. This dress would be suitable for a casual restaurant, hanging out with friends, lounging around the house, or even for a pool cover-up as it is just put on and off over your head. For the price, this is a nice deal, and I am seriously considering paying full price for another color of this dress. It is just that comfortable!

"The set of 3 lunch boxes are amazing! I am a very picky person when it comes to my food touching, and these lunch boxes are sectioned off so my food will never touch. They have awesome clasps that snap and keep suction so they do not leak everywhere. I usually pack my lunch using Tupperware and it is so bulky. I can pack my whole lunch in one of the containers and it is not bulky and does not take up a lot of room in the refrigerator at work. The sleve helps keep my food cooler so I can pack it in the morning and have time to go to the gym in the morning before work.

"This is one of the only screen protectors that I have found for my S7 that actually fits the entire touch screen. I have bought a few lately that  are so small that then makes my touch screen area so much smaller. But this one was different. I rated it 4 stars because there were no directions. The entire box was written in a different language but none of the writing looked as though it was directions. Luckily the wipes had numbers on them so I knew which to use first and luckily I had put on a screen protector like this before so I knew what to do. But if this was the first screen protector I had bought I would not have known what to do. The application process was super easy. You take a film covering off the protector, line the holes and cutouts up then press down. The only negative would be that it seems as though the screen protector isn't pressed down all along the edges. Maybe that's the way it looks because it around the entire screen. It doesn't prevent me from being able to use the phone so it doesn't bother me too much.

I would recommend this product.

"So I payed only $45 including free shipping on EBAY directly from the manufacturer.  It is worth $45.  Compared to my DropCam Pro, it is woefully inferior.  The iPhone interface is cumbersome at best.  Way too many controls.  I do like the on-board SD storage option.  Connectivity is my major issue.  Many times it says connecting but doesn't connect.  No, there is not an issue with my WiFi as my DropCam at the same location connects flawlessly.  Truly at the price point I shouldn't complain much.  Will upgrade to the DropCam at some point.",1

"Holy hell what have I been doing with my life.  Took this out for a test drive last night when I got it and was impressed with the ease of use and straight guts I was achieving.  The handle feels great, you can tell the blade is done with pure craftsmanship.  The sound it produces while cutting is mesmerizing.  I have never heard a rip sound like that before.  I feel that the pull cut is much more precise than the push cut.  I have never cut wood this straight before. Must have for hand cut dovetails.",0

"I like my new passport cover. As you can see in one of the the pictures, my passport fits inside the cover protecting the edges of the passport. There are plastic sleeves for securing the passport. The inside front has a plastic pocket probably good for a card of some sort - ID or credit card. I attempted a picture of the inside front sleeve and card holder. The other picture shows the front cover of the holder. As you can see, it includes a rubber band for keeping the holder closed to further protect the passport. While I am partial to pink, the cover comes in a variety of prints and colors.

"The Vtin Professional Over-the-Head Bluetooth Wireless Headset with Noise Canceling and a Hands Free Microphone is a well-made product with a long 12 hour Battery Life.  I believe the price point to be reasonable for the high quality.  As of this review the price was $25.99 for the unit with Free Prime Shipping.  I gave the product 5 stars for design, manufacturing and price.  I especially liked the fact that the product came professionally boxed and has a warranty.

1) The Headset was shipped in a professionally printed cardboard box.  The outer box was printed with the manufacturers website which is [...] and the Customer Service / Support Email which is support@ivtin.com.

2) The item comes packed on a plastic card inside the box, which also contains a set of directions and the charging cable.  The directions also contain the manufacturers contact information.  Per the Amazon site the item has a 45 days money-back guarantee and 12-month worry-free Guarantee.  I find that to be a big plus.

3) I used this item with my iPhone 6.  Pairing was straight forward per the directions and I found the charging time of 2 hours for 12 hours of talk time to be very good.

4) The unit does provide some noise cancelling however it only covers one ear.  The sound quality was exceptional and the microphone was very easy to adjust.  In addition the headsets headband expands by simply pulling it apart or pushing it in.

5) The unit allows you to answer, mute or end a call as well as adjust the volume up and down.  You can also redial the last number called by simply double tapping the multi-function button.  The buttons were well placed and easy to access.

6) This unit would make a great gift for anyone who likes the Game Console Single Ear Headsets.

I am giving this item 5 stars since it is extremely functional, comes with a warranty and is professionally boxed which would make it a candidate for gift giving.

"I've been looking for a pair of inexpensive sunglasses for my son. Something he could just throw in his backpack. Well I found them.
He's been using them and says he really likes the fit and comfort. The polarization actually helps. Especially when he's outside running drills with ROTC. They are very lightweight which makes them comfortable on the bridge if his nose. For an inexpensive pair of polarized sport sunglasses, the High Contrast sunglasses really fit the bill. The high contrast feature is really just ""enhanced"" polarization with a slight brightening of everything you see. But, the lenses still manage to screen out the brightest rays. So as per my teenage soon: he definitely recommends them for everyday use.

The handle remains cool while cooking and it is dishwasher safe.  It is slotted to allow the straining of oils or sauces.  The price is reasonable for a spatula that will surely last for years to come.  I highly recommend this product.

"This is a GREAT wireless keyboard.  My 18 yr old son spilled a bottle of water onto his laptop therefore ruining his keyboard and this is the second time he's done it! I refused to pay for another repair job, so I decided to try out this product as an alternative.  The keyboard and mouse were so easy to set up, we didn't have any problems with it.  He sets it on top of the old keyboard and uses it just like it were connected.  The keys work perfectly no sticking or double tapping, and the mouse glides perfectly! This was the perfect alternative to a laptop repair. The keyboard is lightweight, it doesn't add much weight to a bag when taking it on the go!

"I bought this girdle to help with giving me a bit more back support with my heavy lifting exercises during my workouts. It's definitely working great for that purpose. This is a great girdle for a bit of cinching and back support. As far as waist training goes, that requires an actual heavy boned corset. This girdle will do nothing for thinning out or defining a thinner waist. With it closed up and worn under clothing it's a bit bulky so it'll definitely show. However, using it during a workout these aren't issues that concern me at all.

The workout girdle comes in a plastic bag and is ready for wear right out of the wrapper. I do corset training so I bought a size I knew I'd be comfortable in. If your new to using cinching garments go with a comfortable size and work your way into tighter garments as your comfort level changes. This girdle helped keep my back a bit more straight than without it which resulted in me being able to push out one to two more reps than I normally would. To me that was an instant win for purchasing this girdle.

I've found no defects in the way this girdle is crafted. All of the hooks are lined up and they all hook/unhook with ease. This is a great addition to my exercise gear and I'm beyond pleased how it's already started helping me improve my workout. I gladly recommend anyone wanting to use one for fitness to buy one and see for themselves how wonderful it is.

"These are okay leggings. There are a few issues with these leggings, but I'll start with the good first. The fabric of these leggings are quite comfortable and the ones I received are a nice black color. However, I'm not so sure I would call these leggings a one size fits all. They go way past capri length (to the heels) on a 5'1"" person. This doesn't mean they are unwearable it just means that you have to hike up the ends of the legs a little bit. These leggings also seem to be a bit see through even on a fairly small person. They aren't the worst see through leggings I've seen but I wouldn't wear them out in public. They will be strictly worn at home for yoga/exercise. I imagine on a larger person the ""see through-ness""  will be worse.

Overall these are okay exercise leggings for wearing around the house. They probably wouldn't be okay to wear out in public, but they are quite comfortable.

"This handbag was one I was looking forward to being that I was in the market for a change of purse at a lower cost. This one looked to fit my needs. Here are some things I noticed and liked about this handbag:

-The handle is compact for hand carrying but not too small to use on the shoulder if you like to carry bags directly under your arm. The handle is made with a shiny black plastic coated matieral with thick stitching. Aside from some slight bending from storage prior to reaching me the handles were uniform and defect free.

-The coloring is off on my bag. It's supposed to be a charcoal grey color however it looks like they took a brown bag and sprayed it with the grey. It shows splotchy under bright light (like in the grocery store) and outside. This was a big bummer for me being that it does not have a try dark grey look.

-The front of the bag has a nice fixed buckle style detail to it and gives a great touch to this bag. The material on the bag is bumpy/textured and gives a great detail as well.

-The bottom of the bag has four pegs to stop the bottom from being set directly on surfaces and protects against damage.

-The inside of the bag is my favorite. The bag has so many pickets and a center shallow divider that has a magnetic button closure. The bag has two nice deep lined pockets on one side and a open area on the other.

Overall aside from the issues with the coloring its a nice bag, it holds everything I could possibly need and I have one in diapers so that's a huge plus, and the bag is holding up nicely thus far.

"This outfit is adorable! For reference, I ordered the smallest size (2-3) for my 8 month old. It is of course big, but she'll be able to wear it now and for at least a year. The colors are gorgeous and it is the perfect ""Cinderella"" outfit. It's ideal for a toddler who wants to wear dress up clothes every day because it's comfortable and non restricting. We'll be using it to wear at Disney World also. Another positive is that there are snaps at the bottom which make it easy for diaper changes or little ones needing to use the potty. The one drawback however is those snaps rusted after the first wash and have left brown stains around the area. I did wash on gentle in a laundry bag, so not sure why that happened. It does not affect the integrity of the dress however and they are not visible when the dress is worn. I did receive this product for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
"Nicely packaged with a 'care card' advising you of how to de-wrinkle the curtains.  Nice color (grey), good fabric.  Minimize light really well.  I live in Alaska, so that's a MAJOR quality when ordering blackout curtains.  Took one star off for not being FULL blackout quality and price.  You can see in the pics how light does seep through the curtain.  I get that the light coming in above and below is due to the rod, but the day this was taken wasn't as sunny as it usually gets here. Since these are shorter and only one panel, I feel they were pricey.

This is because it doesn't seem to be very consistent at all, even at a closer range and I can't ever be happy with how is is sighting in.
Second, there are no open sights, so you have to use a scope on it, annoying if you are wanting to shoot rather quickly.

"I purchased this thinking it would be great!  It didn't seem like a cheap crappy one from China,  but I guess I was wrong.  When it arrived it was packaged really nicely.  It included everything you need to install.  When installed it was full of bubbles from the solution and they would not go away no matter how many times I rubbed them.  The corners kept peeling off and I just got mad and took it off.  I emailed them my complaint and they sent a replacement because they claim it was defective.  The 2nd on I installed with no problems.  No bubbles.  But the they do cause your screen to lose clarity.  You get a fuzzy screen,  but they claim it goes away after a few days.  I'm not sure about that. IT IS NOT CASE FRIENDLY..  it will peel and move and bubble up of you put a case on.

"I bought these for both work and home use. At work, I have been using the lid eraser off an old dry erase marker that quite frankly has seen better days, and at home, my kids have been using paper towels. To say these erasers are much better would be an understatement! They are amazing!

The colors and shape are awesome, definitely more fun to use than the basic black, square eraser. My kids and coworkers both love them, they remove them from my whiteboards, test the magnetic strength, flip them around, etc. The size is perfect for both adults and kids to use. They are great at cleaning the whiteboards without you having to put force into it for the stubborn marks. They also remove all of the dry eraser residue unlike other erasers that still leave ink flakes on the boards.

"I bought this after a very careful selection amongst what is there on Amazon and in Target/Walmart. I found these to be perfect. I am from India, and have n number of spices (powder and raw). These are easy to use, and the stand is very sleek, something which I loved.

The only thing, which if easier would have been a cherry on the cake, is if there was an easier way to put spices into the jar. But I guess thats because of small mouth of the jar which is with every jar you would get.

I recommend it highly.",0

"My husband wears uniforms to work so we keep them separate from our regular clothes and towels (since they smell like diesel fuel).  Right now they usually end up in a clothes basket that sits in the hallway - which I HATE but there really isn't anywhere else to put it.  The Urban Mom Door-Hanging Laundry Hamper was definitely a warm welcome when it arrived!

First Impressions:
Super thick material.  Love the grey with white accents!  The hooks were folded into the fabric for shipping so be careful not to let them fall on your toe when you unfold it.  They aren't heavy but even the lightest things hurt sometimes if they hit the right spot!

I initially tried to hang this on the closet where his uniforms are stored but the door was way too narrow so I moved it to the hall closet and it fits perfectly there.  We have shelves in that closet and even with the bag full, there are no issues closing the door.  (The bag poofs out quite a bit when full.)

Pros:
There is a zipper on the bottom of the bag that allows you to dump them straight into the washer or unzip over a laundry basket and let them fall in.
You can use the bag to carry the laundry in if you have to go somewhere to do your laundry.
The material is thick and there is extra reinforcement around the hole so that it doesn't wear over time.
It's the perfect height for an adult (children might have a hard time reaching it)

Cons:
Sometimes when I remove the bag from the door, the hooks come with it.  It may be my doors aren't thick enough but this is kind of annoying.

Overall it's a great product and exactly what we have been needing!

"In my 10+ years of cell phone use, I have purchased, used, sold, and straight thrown away many different cases from many different companies.  This review will hopefully share with you some of my experience and make the decision to purchase this cell phone case or not easier for you.

Upon opening the box this cell phone case was mailed in, I see a small black cardboard box with paper wrapped around it.  Upon sliding the paper off, I see that this box does not open from the top or sides like a normal box but rather slides open from the sides.  When I slide the box open, I see the cell phone case held nicely into place by a piece of styrofoam.  After easily pulling the case from the styrofoam, I feel the smooth but textured lambskin for the first time.  Upon flipping the phone case in my hand, I notice that the inside of the case is even smoother than the outside and is rather pleasant to feel.  The cell phone easily snaps into the case by placing an entire side of the phone into the case and then snapping the other side in.  The sides of the case where the volume and power buttons are housed are nicely cut out and smoothed over leaving you easy access to the buttons.  Both the top and bottom of the case are also cut to fit, leaving no messy look and easy access to the ports at the bottom of the phone.  With the phone snapped into the case, there is a tiny lip that offers some protection to your cell phones screen should you place it face down on a flat surface.  Being made out of leather, this cell phone case offers you an excellent grip making it very hard for the cell phone to slip out of your hands.

I would highly recommend this phone case to pretty much anybody.  The lamb skin offers you a great look and feel while offering some protection to your phone as well.

"Excellent sounding headphones at a reasonable price. Only reason I gave it less than a 5 star is because I find the adjustable ear wrap a bit awkward to use but once it is on I love using it.

"The merchant shipped 10 bulbs just incase any bulbs got broken.  All 8 of my bulbs with the 2 bonus bulbs in arrived in perfect shape.  So I made out pretty well. These Bulbs are for a E12 light socket and are sometimes hard to find in this size.  The body of the bulb is clear with a flame tip.  They look great and adds a flare to that fancy light fixture or any light fixture for that matter.  Yes, the body of the bulb has a clear glass on all sides, which helps allow more light to cast out from the bulb.  This is important if you require adequate lighting, because most bulbs this size (E12) are 40 watts like this bulb. This allows unobstructed lighting that will not dim through a frosted glass,  which are never bright enough for me.  The clear glass also makes the bulb a little cooler, however they are still hot to the touch.  This bulb is bright for only a 40 watt Bulb.  The light is plenty bright enough.  However, if you are don't mind it darker the frosted bulb maybe for you.  The light is dimmable so you can save a little more energy and / or add that romantic feel without lighting all those candles.  I would definitely recommend this product.

"I refuse to spend more than $50 on shoes or flip flops.

I buy a pair of Reef every year. I get about 10 months out of them, but I wear them for 12. Eventually they wear so thin they go through the air padding in the heel, and though less comfortable than when new they still feel 100x better than old navy flip flops.

I wear them to Vegas no less than 2 times, 12 hikes (no less than one 12000 foot hike, and one through a glacier in the summer), and I wear them with horses and cattle (though I probably shouldn't for safety).

I gave them 5 stars because they work and I won't buy anything else, assuming the price is under $50, because as I said its my personal limit. I'm cheap. These things are not.

The bottle opener is stupid, as I wouldn't put the sole of me feet on my drinks, but functionally I think (no evidence, just experience) that the opener aids it arch support by keeping the sole from over flexing.

I gave them 5 stars because nothing else works for me. Also, I refuse to spend",0

This is one of the best Yoga mats I have owned!  It is 72 inches long which means I can lay down without my head or feet touching the floor! It is also 1/4 of an inch thick so there is enough padding for me to be comfortable. It is reversible so I can flip it over and use the other side. It is made of non slip material for safety.

"This hub is what I really and truly need. It expands my USB ports from two to 4 ports. Here are some other qualities about this port:
Compact & portability: The size of the hub is almost the size of a credit card. It is compact and one can carry it in computer bag, jeans pockets, and so forth. The design of the hub is compact and easy to carry around for all purposes: traveling, mobile working, carrying with you just in case you need it.
The next feature that I enjoy about this hub is the functionality. It is super speed. The data transfer rates is estimated to be up to 5 Gpbs. This is amazing. A word of caution is that your device should also be compatible in order for you to experience the speed. The good news is, you will still enjoy great speed even if your device is USB 2.0 or 1.1. The device is backward compatible. I tested some pictures and videos from my Nikon camera, and I was amazed at the speed while being connected to this device.
Versatile: we want one device with many capabilities. This hub is ideal with laptops, and desktops. I often get to facilities during my travels where I have to use an onsite desktop, but need to connect my usb drives and my other mobile devices. No need to fish for these ports in the back of the PC.
Some areas of improvement, I cannot seem to think of any right now. This is by far a great designed product, compact, portable, great speed for data transfer, bus powered, full functionality, and with free lifetime technical support. Id recommend this device to anyone

As a hot natured person fans are one of my personal favorite things in the world. This is great for so many different things. Even though the AC is on in the car, you can have chill bumps in the front and be sweating in the back. Handing one of these to the kids makes a huge difference. Also you can easily clip it to a grocery cart and many other things. Shopping and riding around are the two times I get the hottest. Oh and sleeping. One of these lives beside my bed at night. I have two larger fans in my room too, but I needed something small for my bedside table, our a/c doesn't reach our room without the fans pulling. I use it at my desk and everywhere.
These fans are strong too! Even the low setting pushes out a good bit of air, but the 3rd setting is amazing!
Takes a few hours to completely charge, The charge lasts all night long on the 2nd setting. I recommend this to every one including my whole family.

"As others have pointed (and still yet unwritten reviews will, no doubt, mention) these locks are in plastic casings and while attractive and conspicuous, they offer less security than hard-case metal ones (Travel Easy, Landing Gear, etc. - all bearing the same manufacturer's logo as these) which are available for a slightly higher price. I, too, found the setting to be a bit awkward but once mastered, it is a piece of cake.

From my point of view, the 'protection' these locks offer is more like that of an unarmed security guard who is not allowed to put hands on anyone but exists, primarily, as a visual deterrent to crime. Likewise, these locks provide little actual protection but, by their very nature and appearance, may help to deter it.

Like most/all of these 3-digit security TSA luggage locks, the combination cannot be changed once set - so be sure to note it down somewhere!

"My husband loves to cook, he is particularly fond of his bamboo cutting boards so you can imagine his distress when he found out that my mom used his to cut raw meat *face palm*. We have small children so we decided to get new cutting boards rather than try to clean, you just never know what can lurk in the knife grooves of the past. I ordered this and another cutting board for him to replace the contaminated ones. First off, this thing is solid. My husband was ecstatic when he saw this, looking forward to getting rid of the old ones even! If you know someone who loves to cook or even a professional chef this board is incredible and would make an amazing gift...or if you accidentally ruined someones cutting boards because you had no idea...this would make an amazing replacement. This is sure to last for years to come, it's absolutely beautiful.

"For what I paid, this little wireless doorbell is pretty cool.  Arrived quickly, good packaging, and fairly simple setup.

There are some things not optimal, such as you'll need to use caution when installing screws to hard mount the button... To do it, you remove the cover, exposing the inside small circuit board with small holes thru which you install screws.  You need to use some force as the back plate has no through holes, so you actually have to screw thru the plastic too.  One slip of the screwdriver and you'll damage the unit.  So BE CAREFUL with this, or, use the double sided tape!

Setup was easy... You need to cycle thru the many tone options one by one, and once you've heard them all, you'll have to go thru again to select yours.  There are a lot of rather bizarre tunes that play which I can't imagine anyone would select... At the loudest volume setting, a lot of them are somewhat painful to hear as the higher frequencies kinda rattle your brain, but we found a few we like and I'm sure you will too.

Another thing to keep in mind is the receiver plug design means that if you plug it into a dual outlet, you'll barely have any room to squeeze only a very small plug into the other receptacle.

Hope sharing these considerations has been helpful for some...Overall, a great little unit for the money (assuming it continues working)!",0
"The was my first experience with buying an LED light bulb, over the years I had used incandescent and then moved to CFL. I have been a big fan of LED lights in other applications like in my car and handheld flashlights so I was excited to use them in the fixtures of my home. First off they are a bit more expensive than incandescent and CFL bulbs, but I think they will be worth it in the long run.  The light that comes of these things is nice and bright and fill the room with light. I also love that they do not give off much heat like the old fashioned light bulbs would, this was nice for my bathroom which was getting a bit warm just from the incandescent light bulbs I had before. These light bulbs also are much more energy efficient than CFL or incandescent bulb, I am hoping to see a dip in my power bill in the coming months if I change all the lights in my house to these.

"Arrived a bit scuffed but totally usable. The size 9 fits my size 7.5 ring finger so I would say the sizes run a bit snug. Great ring if you need something to replace a metal band for safety or security purposes, or simply just for comfort's sake. I would purchase a second one as a gift.

"Im sure we can all relate to having to keep 1000 ziplock baggies in our lives at all times! lol From sending lunches and snacks to school, to bringing snacks on the go, to keeping little items, like screws, together! and much more! I know that in my family, we go through them like crazy! Well Yummi Pouch  Sandwhich bags fix that problem! These cloth reusable bags make snacking easy at home or on the go!

I have used these to pack lunches for my boys. To send sandwiches, chips, fruits, snacks, etc. along with them to work, school, and on the go! These bags are very nice because the are sealed with a zipper so they keep the food inside them fresh. They also keep the food from spilling out of the bags themselves. These are great to have around to take everywhere with you! My son even uses his at home to keep his food in! We LOVE them!

I LOVE that these are washable and reusable! Pay a one time fee and never again! These are great for your pocket book and for the environment! You are not constantly throwing away plastic bags. Instead you are reusing these ones! You can machine wash these. Although I have always hand washed mine, my friend that purchased these machine washes and they are always clean!

These are so great for so many reasons! They save money and save the environment! They are easy to use and easy to clean up after! I LOVE them and will be purchasing some more! They also come in a few really cool patterns!

We purchased to deter Birds and other furry rodents that like to climb into our fruit trees in our yard.  I have tried many other things such as tying a string to a old CD and let it hand from the tree.  People are always asking why there are cds in our trees.  So we decided to try the Scare Tape - Easy to use, just cut a strip and we tied it to a limb.  I know some people staple but we didn't want to damage the tree.  What wind we have made the tape blow.  The sun reflects off it as well and we have had far less birds in the area than before.  I have noticed less holes poked in our fruit which a positive plus. I think it is helping out so far so good.

"So far, so good. We have been infested with ants lately. This is largely due to the lack of rain, I think, but also because our grandson is a little messy sometimes and will leave a plate of cup around and the ants will find it immediately! Those things can smell sugar a mile away! He left a cereal bowl with a small amount of milk in it on his desk, and it was completely covered with ants in the morning! I almost fainted when I saw it! Yuk! We got out our new Death-On-Contact General Bug and Insect KIller and went to work. First of all, we had to get rid of that bowl - which was horrific! Then we began spraying the ants that remained in the area and followed their trail back as far as we could. Most of them died pretty quickly, and we just wiped them up. We waited a few minutes for the stragglers to appear and did the same thing again. This time we got them all. My husband sprayed around inside some of the areas we have seen them the most, and other than one here and there, we've had no more swarms, so I'm happy. He was using Raid, and I didn't like having that in the house, especially with a child around breathing it.

"This wallet seems well made... The stitching is straight and (as far as I can tell) strong. The leather feels really nice.. Soft, not plastic-y... The color is deep and beautiful (i got the rosey-purple color called wine red. But it is a deep magenta color. Very pretty!! Exactly as pictured in the description)

The wallet itself is small but expands pretty wide. One side has 11 spaces, the other side has a wide pocket (they show folded bills in there in the photo) and a small zippered pocket for coins etc. I easily fit 2 plastic cards into each of the 11 sections, or 4 paper business cards, and it zipped with no problem, so I can hold at least 25 of the cards I use. (Some paper business or frequency cards, most plastic)

I generally use a long wallet which holds fewer cards and takes up more space. I'm looking forward to having something smaller in my wallet (since i don't need a checkbook sized wallet any more)

The zipper works smoothly and hasn't caught on the lining for me at all.

There's a convenient windowed space for the drivers license or ID outside.

And I have to state again that I LOVE LOVE LOVE the color!!!

I received this wallet as a discounted sample to test and review, and I offer only my personal observations and opinions. I'd expect to pay $10-$20 for it.

(edited 7/1/2016... as I've spent more time with this wallet, I like it a little less. I still enjoy it, but I've noticed a couple of drawbacks. One, it does't hold quite as many cards as I'd hoped. Over time I removed a few, although it still provides a lot of room. Second, and this is simply personal preference... I prefer not folding my cash up in the wallet, I find myself dropping it into my purse beside it instead. So... I think I will go back to using a longer wallet for cash and keep using this for the bulk of my cards. Maybe as store apps take off and stores start letting us use our phone numbers instead of cards we won't need so many cards all the time. Until then, I'll use this.)",1

"These mini mason jar shot glasses are adorable! They can be used for other things other than shot glasses as they have covers. I will be using mine for storage containers for things like spices and small objects. Each shot glass is 1/4 cup size, about 2-1/2 inches tall with the cover on, and about 6-1/3 inches around the outside of the shot glass. There are six that are included in the set. They are made of thick glass so they are very durable. The cover is stainless steel and screws on and off very easily. One thing I would have liked is if the shot glasses could stack more safely on top of each other. They can be set on top of each other, but they slide very easily.

"I am a traveling therapist doing homecare, so that means that I'm in my car for a good majority of the day traveling from one patient to another.  I was skeptical at first about this phone mount for the car as I need to have my phone accessible for GPS or if a physician calls me, etc however I was wondering if it really would stay in place in the vent of my car.  I was thinking my phone (Samsung s6 edge) would be far to heavy to keep it in place.  So far I have been using this car mount for over a month and it has been PERFECT!  I even have a student who is tagging along with me now and saw it in my car and asked where she could get one!  Very handy and easy to install!  From the website:

The Sorker magnetic car phone holder clips easily to your vehicle's air vent ensuring your phone is within an effortless reach. And allows for easy access to your phone's headphone jack,control buttons and charging port.

To secure your device just place the magnetic metal plates (supplied) in 1 of 3 ways:
1. Stick the adhesive metal plate either directly to the back of your device or on the inside of its case.
2. Place the metal plate in between your device and its case.
3. Stick the adhesive metal plate on the inside of the removable back cover of your device.

Compatible with: iPhone,iPad,Samsung Galaxy,and most other smartphones.

All I did was take it out of the package and install the magnet in between my case and phone.  It is very easy and has a very strong magnet.  I simply placed the vent holder portion securely into the vent and place my phone on it.  It holds up really well- even on bumpy roads!  I just turn my vent off on that one so that hot/cold air isn't blasting on the phone all day.  I will mention that this holder seems to attach and stay on one vent better than the others for some reason, but I've had no problems at all!  GREAT product!

"Great Pillow. I bought the Navy Blue Striped style for my living room couch. I already have blue in there & it matches perfectly. I like all the patterns that this pillow cover comes in, if you want a beachy theme they have a lot of different ones to pick from The pillow is not 100% cotton as the description would have you think, the inside tag says cotton & polyester. The size says 16"" but when mine was stuffed it measured more like 14"", I guess it kind of shrinks in when you stuff it with a pillow. Please not this listing is just for the pillow cover, you will need to go to walmart or such & buy an insert, if you get it from walmart it is in the fabric section. Make sure you know the size because they sell several different sizes. They are relatively cheap around $5 I think.
The bottom has a zipper so you can put the pillow insert inside easily & it also makes the covers easy to wash in the washer. I only buy throw pillows that have a removable cover so I can wash them. The colors are nice, I like how well it goes with the room. The texture of the pillow is soft, the fabric almost feels slippery. It makes a little crinkle noise compared to my 100% cotton covers. I like mine a little softer then these but it will work. The pillows are just big enough in size to rest your head on it if you plan on using it for that. Overall I am happy with my purchase. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.",1
"this is a bad helmet I welded a lot with it. auto darkening went out on me in three months of having it. not satisfied with the product. it was decent for awhile but the back of it the band that attaches it to your head is highly uncomfortable had to replace that has well. I would not recommend this its fine if your only in a welding shop for a couple of hours a day but if this was meant for hard workers and people who are in welding classes all day for almost 8 hours straight I do not recommend this helmet period! I recommend miller, Lincoln electric or save phace helmets. again I am not satisfied with this product after using it for a good while also the shade 13 lens is a joke I let a buddy of mine use it for there mig test and they said the same dang thing! not happy period.",0
I love it! We ordered 3 fans for the bedrooms of our house and they work so well! The fans are really quiet and they don't rattle or make any noise. I highly recommend this Hunter fan!,0
Good washcloths not to thick and not to thin seem to be well made and that they will hold up well. After the first washing ( which you should do before using ) they only lost about .25 inch's off the size and for being all cotton that's good. If need again I would buy them.,0
"This product was received free from the manufacturer in return for an honest and unbiased review.

This is my second foray into the world of the dash cam, something I have been looking at for a while after a protracted legal proceeding to claim back my excess after a no fault accident. It would have been a lot faster had I had the evidence of a dash cam.

The unit sits unobtrusively on the windscreen, held in place with a suction cup mount. A power cable from a cigarette socket is provided

Once switched on the LCD display shows just what the camera is seeing. I was pretty impressed with this, the camera has a 170 degree of arc lens and pretty effectively sees what the driver sees, and a bit more. The image quality is very good as you would expect from a 1080 p HD camera.

I installed a 64 gb sd card into the easily accessible slot and was good to go. Recording is a simple matter, and I particularly like the motion sensor that switches the camera on when the car starts to move and off again when it stops. I had to play around a bit with the sensitivity to get the best results, but I was extremely impressed.

I simply popped the card and inserted into my computer to download the images, there were no problems here. The recorded video was of high quality, and impressive in it's detail. You can also download via the USB cable.

As well as recording what the car is doing there are some driver safety functions, such as lane departure and forward collision warning. I tried these and they work well though I would use them as a back up and not as a replacement for safe driving and good observation! You also need to turn the forward collision function off when trying to park in a tight spot.

In all this camera is very easy to use, easy to install and gives excellent quality footage for very little effort. 5 stars,",1
"When I first started using adult coloring pages, I was using only wax based colored pencils such as crayola and cra-z-art to color with. It was ok, but then I found out about gel pens (especially glitter) and my pages really started to come alive. I have tried many different brands and at different price levels. And there a lot of them, but each one has its own attributes whether it be point size or color variations.  These pens are a little bit different because they have a finer point.  That makes them very nice.
These pens are really easy to use and take little to no priming to get the color to flow evenly. I did have tighten the tip of a couple of the pens, most likely they came lose in shipping. Upon coloring with these pens for the review I did like the size of the tip, they are great for both large and small spaces and only a couple of them were scratchy instead of smooth, and if I am being totally honest I have never found a set yet that did not have at least 1 scratchy pen. I would recommend these pens to anyone who loves to color with gel pens. I did receive these pens at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.",1

"The case is working great. You charge the case using a standard lightening cable. There is no cable included so you must provide your own. It's nice to have a case with the same charging cable as your phone itself because that eliminates the need for multiple cords. Many charging cases use micro USB cords.

The case charges slower than my phone itself but also has more charge capacity so that makes sense. It helps my phone last all day, and I'm very heavy user.

The case construction is pretty solid. It's easy to put on and take off. All buttons are accessible and all of the phones functions work well with the case in place. The prop stand on the back is a nice bonus.

This case seems slower to charge than others but it still lasts the day.

I was provided this case free for product testing and review.",1
"My wife really loves this.  She says it's very comfortable and the material is great quality.  She enjoys sleeping in it especially since it's not too warm. I really enjoy her wearing it because it looks fantastic on her.  The only con that we can come up with is the tie string in the back. It is quite aggravating because the string does not want to go through the holes. Other than that, this product is great and I will be looking for more for my wife. For full disclosure, I received this item at a discounted price in return for my honest and unbiased review after using the product.

"I brought the color black in size small.  It fits the body just fine, but the sleeves are a bit loose.  I would prefer it if the sleeves have a much tighter fit.

Pretty straightforward and simple really.  If you're in the market for more shopping bags, ones you don't have to throw away, here you go.  I would recommend this seller to other shoppers as I had no trouble at all.  It's a shopping bag and for my shopping uses it works just fine.  Not too big, not too small.

"These light bulbs are very bright. They're called daylight and they remind me of fluorescent bulbs by the light that they put out. I love that because I have them right over top of my computer and I can see everything perfectly clear.  I don't want any warm light in my office so I have really love these. If I want to be able to dim them I realize that I'm going to have to get an updated dimmer switch because the older ones don't work with the led's. That's fine because I don't need to dim these anyways. The lifespan on these is supposed to be like 50,000 hours and I sure hope they last that long because I really like them. I gave them five stars because they work perfect in every application. I receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

Criteria for products I review with Amazons Rating Criteria in Parentheses:
 1 star (I hate it!): Feel it's a waste of money. Will never use it again. Would never recommend. Not safe to use. Either throw away or return it.
 2 star (I don't like it): Don't like it and wouldn't use it again, but may still have at least 1 positive thing about it.
 3 star (Its ok): Product has both positives and negatives, and I may or may not continue using it. Someone else may like it more and is potentially still worth purchasing.
 4 star (I like it): Item as described in functionality, purpose and quality. May have 1 or 2 things I don't care for or would change, but not big issues. Would recommend it if asked.
 5 star (I love it!): Practically perfect. Nothing is lacking in functionality or quality. Love it and would not only recommend, but would purchase for others and continue to purchase for myself.",1

"For someone who has lived with an old-school crank pencil sharpener for years, the chance to receive one of these in exchange for an honest review was more than welcome.  That old sharpener is so ugly and does such a poor job, I have it mounted on a shelf out in the garage!

This baby arrived in the mail today, attractively packaged in a plastic box with instruction sheet, USB cable and extra blade module.

Pop 4 AA batteries into the well and do your thing.  It sharpens pencils.  Period.  5 stars.

I don't personally intend to use it tethered via USB, but thats a nice feature if you are so inclined.

I cant agree with the reviewer that said the shavings well was difficult to remove.  Just press the sides together with two fingers and gently rock it back and forth until it comes out.  Then empty.

Very pleased at this point and will update, if necessary, as time goes on.  This one gets to stay in the house!",1

Each of these have their own distinct ups and downs. The HIMBOX HB-F01 is a Hybrid type of FM transmitter which provides the best of both worlds which plugs into your car's charging port while providing a powerful 2.4A USB charging port and using a 3.5mm Jack for your phone for better sound  quality

This also happens to be my favorite kind of FM transmitters available today

Design
The Himbox HB-F01 consists of a charging unit that plugs into your cars cigarette lighter charing port and has a 2.4A USB port for charging your cellphones/devices. The USB port is lit with a Blue LED from the inside telling you that its powered on . The second part of this transmitter is a main controller Unit with a Red Segment LED display for the frequency and frequency adjusting buttons on either side which then extends into a 3.5mm jack that plugs into your phone. The cables are nice and thick and the Build quality also appears to be good which should last a good amount of time.

Performance
As with any FM transmitter it is really critical to find the right frequency with least amount of interference for optimum sound quality  . Ideally once tuned you should hear little or no static with nothing playing on on your phone/stereo - If you do hear static you have to keep trying until you find the right one. Once tuned the HimBox FM transmitter provides really good sound quality with very good Bass . Treble and voice reproduction (see my video) with almost no static - thats the main advantage of the 3.5MM jack plugging directly into your phone rather than using Bluetooth . It is also easy on the phones battery , as you don't have to turn on bluetooth.

The performance of the 2.4A charging port is also very solid and I was able to get readings of 1.3A to 1.4A using the Ampere app while charging my Galaxy Tab ( Its rated for a max of 2A), and the reason we won't see a full 2A reading is because the screen is drawing some power while the display is turned on . But a reading of 1.4A is very solid with the screen and device is on . You should be able to charge your phone and tablets at a very good rate

Pros
- Hybrid design gives the best of both worlds  it provides very good and clear sound quality using the 3.5mm jack while not completely wasting your car's power port by providing a power 2.4A charging port
- Sound quality is very good
- Easy to operate and read control panel
- Build quality is good with use of nice thick wires which should withstand wear and tear
- Does not eat too much of your phones battery as it doesn't use Bluetooth

Cons
-No built in microphone means you cant use it to answer phone calls - they tend to be weak on such devices,But if thats a requirement this one may not fit your needs
- You may need to use a double sided mounting tape (not included) to place the controller in an easy to reach position

Closing Thoughts
The Himbox Hybrid type of FM transmitter is one of the best choices you have available for your car with excellent sound quality and the practicality of a powerful USB charger - All at a an unbeatable price making it a very compelling buy and one of my favorite. Highly recommended

The best thing I could have bought for my 2 lil pups!,0
"I purchased the Black Modern Place Coffee Thermos mainly for use as a coffee thermos, but it works great for keeping beverages cold as well as hot. The thermos arrived in good shape, wrapped in a plastic bag, and inside a cardboard box. I washed the thermos and tested it to see how well it kept beverages both hot and cold. It kept my coffee hot for over 12 hours and my ice water cold for 24 hours.

I like the feel of the bottle, and it fits in my cars cup holder. This bottle is very tough and I have not noticed any leaking.

"I'm delighted with these headphones. I charged them overnight, flipped the on button, and they instantly appeared on my iPhone. Easiest pairing process ever. The sound quality is good, and they are comfortable. I am using them for cardio workouts and general music listening. It's nice that they fold to tuck into my purse. A little pouch to carry them in would be nice, but I am using a soft eyeglass case. The headphones came with instructions, extra earpieces to customize the fit, and a charging cable.  They feel sturdy and well made, and the wires retract to protect them from damage when you're not using them. I received a discount on this product in exchange for an unbiased review.",1

This holder is decent but it does not maintain your phone well. The phone will flop around on it and that's if you can get the phone in the ridges with a case on it. It does grip the car though. I did notice if leaving residue of some type on my dash though.,0
"HOLY CRAP! I have wanted one of these for a long time. But all the ones that I have looked at are European models and cost $70 or $80. This one is $19 with free shipping.

The quality really could NOT be better. I am amazed at the level of it. Very pleased. The only complaint I have is there is no real instructions with it. You would think it would be self explanatory and just plug and play. And that may be so with a lower end pressure washer, mine is not though. I actually had to turn my pressure washer all the way down so that it would actually foam the soap. Once I did this I got the thick foam that we are all looking for. I have to give a heads up to ChrisFix on youtube for the link to this product by the way.",1
"I purchased these after using a set of gloves that my daughter in law had. Using her set, I was able to reach into a crock pot and pull a whole chicken out of boiling hot juices. Sure, I could feel the heat, but it wasn't concerning. This is a different brand, however, and after my first test, putting my hand in hot water to pick up hard boiled eggs, I did feel somewhat concerned about the amount of heat I felt. I wasn't comfortable leaving my hand in the hot liquid for very long.. which would be somewhat required for long enough to lift a chicken out of a crock pot. When I do try that, I will be cautious... and if that test is successful, I will return to change my rating to 5 stars. I do feel that using these to flip food on a grill, it would be just fine. Short term exposure! I love the silicone hot pad holders. I cook my bacon in the oven and felt very secure lifting a pan of hot grease and bacon out. I like that they are easily washed if food or grease gets on them, as does happen sometimes with typical cloth type pot holders.

"I do love this cheese board. The design is gorgeous and will go with any kitchen design, I personally have the coffee/ bistro design. And this goes perfectly.  I think the utensils work great and are very sharp. Definitely keep these away from little hands.  I think the ceramic plate is a nice touch to this board, it gives a better flare than other cheese boards.  The tiny tasting forks are a good addition as well.  I thin my favorite part is the names and designs of the different cheese words on the board. I don't see a negative w towards this board right now, but if something comes up, I'll definitely update my review.

"This is a great product. My six-year-old daughter loves filling and refilling these with all sorts of juices. The only negative thing is that the small ziploc-type slider is kind of hard to open and close. So some adult supervision is required. But generally, we love these.",0
"Beautiful necklace and perfect for yourself or a gift. I actually got this necklace for my daughter since she loves jewelry. She is only 6 so I don't like to get anything too big or bulky or on the flip side anything too small(hard too get on) or tight. The ""E"" is so cute and the pendent is a perfect size(about the size of my pinky nail).
My daughter loved the necklace and she wears it all the time. It is super light weight and easy to get on and off of her when needed.
The shipping wasn't prime so it took a little longer but it was packaged very nicely which would make it really easy to gift to someone special. It came in a nice velvet bag which was a nice addition to the necklace and a nice bag to easily store your new jewelry in.
Overall this is a perfect jewelry piece and I think I am going to buy one for myself as well so we can have matching necklaces (except with my initial).

"I ordered and quickly received the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Case - Diztronic Voyeur - Matte Black & Crystal Clear - Soft Touch TPU GS7 Edge Bumper Frame & Hard PC Back Cover Window with Anti-Scratch Coating.  This Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Case bu Diztronic was mailed in a brown card board shipping box along with a few other items I ordered were shipped to my front porch by UPS.  This case is packaged in a thin brown card board phone case box with the companies logo on the front box in black.  This case is clear with a black frame (trim) going around the phone.  The entire back of this case is crystal clear and allows you to personalize your phone with a picture or something under this back or just use the clear back to show off the back of your phone.  There are raised lips on the corners of the back of the case to protect the back of the phone.  There is also a raised lip on the front of the cover to protect the phone screen if you lay the phone down screen first on a level surface.  The cut outs for the phone and the bottom ports are done very well, it does not impede the functionality of phone. The corners are reinforced to withstand a drop if that does happen. The buttons are black in color as to not take away from the sleekness of this case. This is a very thin case and does not add any bulk to your phone. The edge on the phone is still open and functional. I really like this product I think it enhances the look of the phone and the functionality is still there. I would recommend this case to anyone looking for a clear case

"Exactly what I expected, in the exact quantities I expected. The coupon terminology dictionary was useful, as I am a beginning couponer. The starter pack includes plenty of sleeves for probably someone's first 3-4 weeks of couponing, if buying inserts faithfully. After that you will likely need to get some extra sheets. Then again, if you are a light couponer who keeps up with expiration dates, you may not need new sheets for a while. My only wish is that the sleeves were double-sided. You can put coupons in the front of each sheet and the back of the top row, but you can't put anything in the back of the other rows for two-sided pages. See pictures.

All in all, a good starter pack that I would recommend to someone just starting out!",0
"So cute! I love the color combos & this one is my current fav. Seriously, I love this wallet & am now looking for a new bag to match!

Lots of compartments for cards, zippered areas for change, etc., ID card window - everything you need in a wallet in all the right places. Seems to be well-made (no lose threads, seams that look like they'll unravel, etc.). I absolutely buy another color combo if I needed a new wallet. Good stuff! (Arrived FAST, too!)

"I have tried so many screen protectors for my cell phone, and this one definitely one of my favorites. You feel like there is nothing on your screen. I have received it yesterday and tried on my phone. I posted a picture on how it looks. You can see how clear it is. The glass is very durable and very tempered. It was very easy to apply, and I had no problem with air bubbles. It sticks so smoothly to the screen. The sensitivity of the touch screen is not affected at all.
The package of the screen protector is very nice and protective. It comes with a wet wipe pad, and a dry mob. Also, there is blue tape like square. This is for the removal of any dust that might stick on the original screen before placing the new screen protector.
I have long nails and I used to always scratch my previous screen protectors. However, for this one, I tried to scratch it with my nails on purpose, but it did not get affected. I am very impressed. I haven't drop my phone yet, so I do not know if it is going to break easily.
Overall, very good quality.

"I got this backpack to carry my books and laptop in for my master's program that I'm starting in the spring.  It's very stylish, has leather straps and zipper pulls.  The fabric is thick and feels really durable. I was able to fit all of the books and notebooks I will need for a day of classes plus my tablet.  I can fit a decent sized book as well as the notebooks for the class and my laptop as well (there's a padded section in the main cavity for electronics to be safely transported in).  It has multiple smaller pockets in addition to the main cavity.  There's on inside of the top flap, one on the inside of the main cavity opposite the padded technology pouch, one on each side, one on the very front of the pack, and then there's one that's kind of hidden that is on the back of the pack.  It's on the right side, nice for your phone or something like that that you might want to be able to get a hols of quickly.  It appears to be sturdy and well made. No worn areas or loose threads.  I'm not entirely sure why it's being marketed as a men's product, as I am a lady and am quite excited about using it.  It seems pretty unisex to me.  All in all I'm excited about this purchase.

"I have always used a screen protector on my phone ,but wanted more protection if I had dropped it on the ground. After getting a few small scratches from dropping my phone a few times I decided maybe it was time to put a case on it to keep it from future damage. I got this case since the design is simple and I'm mainly using it to protect against scratches. I LOVE that I can clip it on my belt!  I can't speak to how much protection it offers as I'm not going to test that intentionally, but I can say with confidence it offers much more protection than a screen protector.

"I received this product awhile back, and took me awhile to review because I needed to actually use it first! So now I can speak from experience as we just took this on a long trip to the south of France.  We found it comfortable, convenient, secure, discreet (does not show through the clothes), and easy to use.  There were plenty of HOT days and this was fine to have against the skin without being uncomfortable - basically, it ""breathes"" well and doesn't make you sweat all over the place.  We used it daily and it had plenty of room to fit our essentials: cash, a few cards, passport, and a small set of keys (to our rentals), and even room for a couple very small vials of homeopathic remedies I like to have on hand without making it too bulky or overstuffed to securely access our cash and cards. I LOVE that it has the RFID blocking which is crucial in this day and age.

I have travelled a lot of the world and certain places in Europe are known for their pick-pocketing.  To me, a money belt is an essential.  Also, the scanners people are using to commit identity theft is a worldwide problem (hence the need for RFID blocking).

If you want a few personal tips to increase your security, then read on, if not, then you can skip the next paragraph.  Research and know your destination and how common theft is. Or, just assume it is and take precautions.  For our travels in France, theft is VERY common in all the places we travelled (it was easy to see plenty of reviews on tripadvisor for pick-pocketing and many car break-ins as well).  To keep your holiday smooth and hassle free as possible I would suggest leaving your car with absolutely nothing in it at all times when parked - or at the very least nothing showing. Do not load your money belt in front of your car - it will send a green light to possible thieves that you are a tourist and may have additional items in your car. Using your money belt is fine in public - I just would not load it in front of the car.  Make sure to keep your money belt neat and clean and do not overstuff it to risk dropping cash and cards. If need be, clear it of any accumulated receipts or clutter accumulated each day.
If packing chapstick, lipstick, etc... makes it hard to reach the important essentials easily and securely then just hold onto them elsewhere like a pocket, small purse, or backpack. Anyway, these are just some tips that will hopefully add additional help for some.  I have travelled all over the world for many years and I just like to be able to offer advice and suggestions in hopes that it can help someone.  All that being said - the world is wonderful!! Go out and travel!! Don't be scared (of thieves and the like) just be smart and you will not be targeted ;) This money belt is a great smart start! ;)

"Thing is junk. I have latest version 10.11.5 (el cap on early 2011 macbook pro 13) and does not work. Sure there may be a fairly complex workaround to make it work, but for all intents and purposes, it does not work. I expect plug and play or something close to it. I couldn't even downlad the drivers or software from the manufacturer. The mini disc they include is worthless on vacuum drives (the cdrom's in all macbooks).

In fact, after pulling it out the usb slot my onboard bluetooth now is ""unavailable"" and only works again when i restart it. Havent tested on windows or ras pi, but I suppose i will just so i can find a purpose for this. But now new ras pi 3 includes bluetooth so it is even more worthless....",0

"This hammock is very nice! It comes in a nice carrying bag, is made of very nice parachute material, and the straps that are included with this hammock are very nice. We have a lake house and wanted to purchase a second hammock and we are very happy with this purchase. This hammock is nicer than the original hammock we have that is made from the same material. My husband was very impressed with the straps that came with this item. We love that this hammock holds up to 400 lbs. We have kids that like to play in the hammocks and swing in them so we like that this product is made of nice quality materials and holds up.

"I got a sample pack of two bulbs, one soft white and one day light, I am 65 years old and I have never and I mean never seen light like this come from electricity light bulbs of only 60 watt. I put 1 bulb up in a 4 bulb fixture under a ceiling fan that had the florescent type and a regular incandescent bulb, this LED 60 watt bulb was so much brighter than the other two, I got on AMAZON and ordered 12 of the day light bulbs before my wife could get down from the ladder. Thanks to VIVID LIGHTING I can see all over my house with most rooms needing 1 or 2 light bulbs any more is a waste. And just think of the money saved by just costing less than 1 dollar a year to operate each bulb. Thanks again VIVID LIGHTING. The only bad thing is I probably won't ever have to order again because they last on average of 22 years. LOL the joke's on you VIVID!!!",1
"Seems very good quality and the size is relatively small for 21w, especially when folded.  Wow, very thin and easy to carry.  My only concern is breaking the panels. I assume they are glass because they are very stiff. I may revise my review later if they prove easily breakable.

"Finally I can stop yelling at my husband to clean the walls after hammering steaks with the old fashion meta tenderizer hammer.  I always found pieces of meat and spots of blood everywhere!  The tenderizer is awesome for using on beef, pork and even chicken.  The blades are super sharp and able to penetrate and pierce through easily.

So easy to use and by just placing over the meat and pushing down.  Simple to clean too and dishwasher safe.  Safety cap is included.

The blades and metal hardware are of stainless steel.

"This is hands down has been the easiest and best wireless doorbell I have own! I purchased this one simply for the fact that is was wireless, and because I live in an apartment complex I wanted to get something people could use the was distinctive and yet I be able to take it with me when I moved.

The Doorbell unit comes in a couple different color choices but I opted to go with black and not some of the other fun colors they have. The main unit that plays the tones for the bell is small and compact about eight inches tall and five inches wide with a depth of about two inches, so it doesn't take up a tone of space. It offers sixteen different tones for your listening pleasure and yes the traditional doorbell tone is in the mix. The unit itself feature a visual feature also the blue ring will flash when the bell is pressed, you can also set it to not flash and just have the tone, or to have the tone and delayed flash of the blue ring. There are four sound levels and each is good I have mine on the second setting and can hear it anywhere in my apartment including the back of the apartment. The doorbell part the hand outside is not as sleek and stylish as the main unit, it features a clear cover over white paper and a metal finished button, and the housing being black plastic like the main unit. If you wanted to get creative you could do something with the white cover since they do provide extra mine came with five. Everything you need the mount the unit comes with it including anchors for drywall installation.  I simply use the removable adhesive strips to mount mine. The remote is built to be outside, it has rubber covering to protect the inside mechanisms.

 It didn't take much effort to sync the remote to the main unit, and you are able to add additional remotes to the unit. The doorbell unit also comes with the batteries you need so it is ready to go once you slip the batteries in. Easy to setup, easy to install, in minutes.

The reading is very quick and it fits comfortably in your hand. There is a opening on the bottom most likely for a wrist strap or to loop it onto a tool belt or something similar. It comes with it's own battery which was very nice. There is also a auto-off function to save battery life. I was provided this product for an honest evaluation & review.",1

Which apparently is a good thing. :) She likes them so much she asked me to purchase her another set in a different color.  If my grandmother likes them anyone will because she is one picky lady. They are really nice quality for the price too.

This tape kit is a really good deal whether you're someone that goes through tape rather quickly or just likes to stock up on stuff for the coming years. I compared this tape to name brand scotch and noticed that it wasn't as thick as the scotch stuff, which is what a normally use. I decided to ship out a package using the Novo tape instead and the shipment arrived just fine (i sent it to a friend). Despite the thinner design, I don't think it will be an issue. Moving onto the roller, it works just like any other brand. Push the tape onto the cog wheel and then feed through the metal lever, and you're good to go! You can actually adjust the tension of the cog wheel by twisting that little knob in the center as well. This will help with the output of the tape, whether you want it to flow easily or have to put a decent amount of force into it. Anyways, most people mistake the plastic piece above the serrated teeth for a guard, when really it acts like a squeegee for tape, and it works great. This tape kit will last a long time for me, and I probably won't be buying tape for a few years. I recommend this!

"This set of containers has a collection of 20 different colorful pieces. (Some are duplicated colors BUT still super colorful) The product description says 'non stick containers' and I can honestly say they are non stick containers and the description tells the truth, I've put them to the test with everything I can find that's sticky and not a single things will stick to these. So in my own opinion that's a plus PLUS not just a plus. They for well enough so that the lid does not to pop off in your pocket and the lid stays on tight which is another plus PLUS because no one wants a lid to fall off. These containers are perfect for a variety of things like oils, herbs, grains, home made cosmetics, and anything small you'd want to keep track of. These have been VERY useful in this household and we have used them for everything and used them a lot since we received them.

"Worked perfectly fine on my mother-in-law's iPad Mini 2! Just like with some other glass screen protectors, this cover went on perfectly. The instructions and preparation materials was a nice touch. As long and you clean your iPad screen before applied this it should go on fine. Be sure to align the glass before placing it on your iPad. When you first place it on your iPad, you do have a few tries to slowly lift it off and readjust it. For me, I was able to do it on the first try, but there were times when I needed a few chances to do it.

Alot of us women with larger fingers cant get our fingers in those tiny little factory case holes. This case makes is easy! It also ships lightning fast. I love the great color, it seems to have a brightness to it, that I just adore. This case just seems to have a bit more quality put into it than the other cases I have had in the past, it is much firmer and the ends of my case are so firm and well intact.. its very high quality!.

Dont waste your time and money with cheaper more inferior products!! I truly expected to pay so very much more. You can just tell a difference with this c ase and cheaper cases. Look at them side by side, check the color and the strength of the case. Its hands down better than any case I have ever owned. When you pay so much for a phone, don't take any chances on cheaper cases that don't fit as well as these, and don't help you grip them.

"Overall I am very happy with these 2 in 1 stylus pens. First off, these pens are conveniently skinny and feels quite solid.  The stylus portion is very responsive with my tablets and smartphones.  I don't have any issues with the stylus scratching the screen or other damages.  It is easy to twist the pen and expose the tip.  I really like that they are medium tipped and are quite light. The best part is the ink just flows rather smoothly when writing. There are no stoppages, clumping or inconsistent amounts of ink that comes out while writing. I have been using the same pen daily for the past couple of weeks and it has so far been going strong in its ability to retain a lot of ink. The medium tip really makes writing on forms quite convenient and effortless. I do recommend these to others as the quality of writing is extremely good.

"Great digital thermometer! I wanted this thermometer because it was longer and would work better in large portions of meat like ham or turkey. It is very durable and packaged extremely well. The temperature reading was very similar to another digital thermometer that I own when I tested them against each other. I think it would work well on smaller cuts of meat such as steaks as well but I haven't tried this yet. I like that it is longer so you don't have to stick your hand next to the hot product in order to use it. It has a good protective cover for when not in use which is a great safety feature.

"This is one of those products that scores on functionality - it does what it's supposed to do.  It's really thin and sleek, and has a subtle ring of light around the base that pulsates to indicate active charging.  I have another charger with an obnoxious super-bright charging light that lights up my bedroom at night (not a good thing), so I appreciate this one being more subdued.  Like all of these kinds of wireless chargers it's a little picky about placement position, but once you figure out how to position your phone it's a non-issue.  The charger works consistently and works well.  It is able to charge through my phone's Otterbox Symmetry case, which is a nice.  It does not get hot with my Galaxy S7, something I've experienced with other chargers.  It also doesn't support fast charging with my S7 - not a criticism as it doesn't claim to, but something to be aware of.  All in all this is a perfectly fine charger that's slim, reliable, and does well exactly what it's supposed to do.  Full disclosure, I'm an active Amazon reviewer and was fortunate to receive this complimentary charger in exchange for my honest & unbiased review, which is exactly what I've provided.",1
"I was on the market for a new shower mat for the last week because my daughter slipped and fell while taking a shower last week.  When she fell, she busted her chin open and blood went everywhere.  I had enough and decided to find something that would work.  I came across this safety mat and I'm really glad I did.  Outside the fact that I have 2 daughters and my mother and sister both live with me... (my poor husband) the mat is a beautiful light pink!  Everyone loves the color and it works very well.

The mat is oversized and takes up most of the floor in the shower.  I was expect this mat to cover maybe half of the floor but I would say that it takes up 3/4 of the shower which add so much safety for everyone!  The bottom has suction cups built in so the mat doesn't slid which I love.  The top also has bubbles on top of it to add traction for the person taking the shower, nice addition.

Overall I was really surprised at how well the product was made and love the fact that the mat was so large.

Very cool that it comes with a scraper and a plate to create art on.  This is a great beginner kit for anyone who doesn't already have supplies for a 3D pen.  It would make an excellent present for someone.  No bubbles in the filament to clog the pen with.  Comes out smooth and fits the 3d pen.

"Good packaging, box has nice branding with lots product information. The aluminum gives it a solid quality feel, size and weight is perfect for me using it as my main work inspection light. The 3000mah batteries are a nice touch,a lot of other brands give you low capacity batteries. Kinda weird that they don't provide battery for the small flashlight. Batteries take a long time to charge (hours) but batteries do last a long time too. Not sure it's truly 1200 lumens but the light is clean and very bright. The zoom is one of the best features letting you go from a wide beam to spot beam with just sliding the head forward. The one thing that takes away from the flashlight is the on/off ,beam selector switch, at times the switch changes modes instead of just needing it to turn off & on.

"This case is a must have for your Galaxy S7. I can't really give this case enough praise, it's that good. Ports line up perfectly, buttons feel very responsive and clicky when pressed. What really makes is case standout is that it's thin for a hybrid case,  it has a nice extra high lip to protect the screen while faced down, and the grip that the textured back provides is absolutely exceptional.

I got the gold color ToiKo X_Guard case for my gold Galaxy S7. The gold color of the case is a little lighter gold than the color of the phone. More of a champagne color than a rich gold. I think it looks great. The clear TPU core material is very nice and flexible without being too soft. It's also not perfectly clear but more frosted while still being transparent enough to see the color of the phone. I like this case so much that I might purchase the black case to use the black TPU core with the gold outer shell. I think a black and gold color combination would make this case look even better. There are no sharp seams or any parts of this case that take away from the experience of holding my phone and I'm 100% confident that this case will protect your phone from significant drops and scrapes.

I am recommending the Toiko X-Guard to all my friends and family. I think that this case is a must have, especially if you are looking for great drop protection, good looks, and exceptional grip. Great work on this case Toiko!

I received this case for free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

Update: I recently received the black Toiko X-Guard for my Galaxy S7 and I am still extremely happy with this phone case. This is still my go-to case because of the great protection at grip this case provides. The black TPU feels the same as the transparent TPU from the gold case but the black plastic textured backing feels slightly different than the gold textured backing. Both backings feel very grippy in the hand but the gold backplate feels slightly more rubberized and just a little softer. I'm now using the black TPU core with the gold plastic backplate. This color combination looks great. I also have to say that the transparent TPU core looks exquisite with the black back plate as well. These cases are great for mix and matching colors.  The overall quality between both colors is still way above the curve compared to other cases on the market. This case is a must have protective product for my Galaxy S7. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.",1

"I'm so very pleased with these serrated steak knives from A Cut Above Cutlery. I purchased them for my husband as part of his birthday gift. He's a big meat eater and I knew he would love these - he did! What I like:
1. They are nicely weighted. Not heavy, but not flimsy - they feel substantial.
2. They are sharp! (But not so sharp you could be cutting off your finger and not know it until it's hanging off your hand).
3. They come in a fab, compact box to keep them in excellent condition and make them easy to store.
4. As far as steak knives go, they are sexy.
5. They make a fabulous gift! Although a feng shui expert once told me it's poor form in China to give knives as a gift (it's considered bad luck) so do what you will with that tidbit.
6. I've been using steak knives for years with big, wooden handles - they are fine - a little cave man/Viking - but these are more elegant.
I'm happy to retire the wood set and add these to my dining arsenal. Nice!  I took photos but am having issues uploading - will try to add them when whatever's going on stops going on. I received the item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",1

"I love getting Kangaroo wigs. They are always well made and fun to wear! The Afro wig comes packaged in a plastic bag, and in a net to keep it from tangling. All i needed to do before wearing it was a little finger combing to shape it. The wig is securely sewn into the head cap, making it durable and able to stand up to the sometimes rough play of kids, which is important for me as my nieces and nephews all love to play dress up.  The hair is soft, i was able to wear the wig for a few hours without it itching or irritating me. The Afro is unisex, and looks good on both males and females. My son loved wearing it.  This is a great wig for the price, and would be perfect for Halloween, a costume party or just to change up your style. I received this product at a discount/for free in exchange for my honest review. I never leave good reviews that aren't warranted.",1
"I ordered these lights after watching a YouTube video on how to change the traditional lights out. The man in the video recommended changing to LED bulbs, and the energy savings, and I thought I'd give it a try.

First, let me mention that I purchased this product. I did not receive a free product in return for a review. Having said that, these are fantastic. They are actually brighter than the old bulbs, far easier to remove (should they ever go out), and don't get overly hot, thanks to the aluminum casing. Also, I had previously had the problem that the traditional bulb would get so hot that the glue holding the glass lens would fail and the glass would come off. These have the glass securely on, and again, they don't get that hot, so I'm relieved not to have to deal with that problem anymore.

Product was packaged well, nothing arrived broken, and I had them all installed in 20 minutes (the hard part was getting the old ones out). I even had one light that wouldn't light with a traditional bulb, and it lit up wonderfully with the LED bulb in place. I would definitely buy again.",1

"This iPhone battery case works really well. I have been testing this case for a while and it works really well. It charges the phone well and it is marketed at a great price. The item arrived quickly and was well packaged. It is nicely designed. It is sleek, minimal, and clean looking. The aesthetics compliment my space gray iPhone very well. The Zerolemon logo is located on the back and proportioned with the size of the case.
The case itself is strong, sturdy, and has proven quite reliable. The case consists of a frame and a battery, that snaps together instead of sliding together as the advertisement seems to suggest. Regardless of that, the case is built well and does not come apart unless willed. My phone has been safe with normal use. The volume and power buttons are covered and the mute button is open. The placement of the speaker ports are at the front. The case is made of rubber. It feels good in the hand but it is a bit slippery. It is not a fingerprint-magnet, but fingerprints do shows a small amount. The case is a bit heavy for one-handed use, but it is one of the slimmest cases I have seen. Unfortunately, the audio jack hole could be a bit bigger. Some of my headphones don't fit. Most of the time I use bluetooth so it isn't a huge bother but, if all you use is wire buds you may or may not have a fit. The slim apple provided buds fit and any like it would likely be ok. The manufacturer should have added an extender with the case, similar to what they have done with the lightning port.
Charging the case is simple. The case uses a Micro-USB cord, to charge and sync. The case does not get hot while charging, which is a big plus. The battery case charges from 20% to 100% in about two hours and, even after a full charge, the battery case still shows two indicator lights left (25-50%). The switch to the battery can accidently be triggered if placed in a pocket or loose in one's bag.
After much use and a few drops here and there, I am pleased to say that this is a pretty nice piece for the price. I would have liked to see a few differences but, truly the positives outweigh the negatives. For the price, the battery case is the best option for iPhone 6 owners looking to extend their battery life. I highly recommend Zerolemon and look forward to using more of their products in the future. This item was received on promotion in exchange for my testing and review.",1

"A torch is a torch, right, even one that has an LED instead of a filament bulb?

So when asked by Anker to review a sample, I did think twice, why do I need another torch? Ive got several in the drawer, even LED ones, an Inova X5, cheap ones from the local supermarket and I even have a couple of old filament bulb torches, the AA Maglite!

Then I thought, why not? It comes from a company I associate with external batteries and charger cables of quality. So what have they done with the lowly torch? How does this one compare with the others? So I said yes, please!

Packaging: It comes neatly packaged in a recyclable bag and cardboard box with clear pictures on the side to help you figure out how to use it. No batteries included, 3 x AAA are needed and I guess this makes them easier to send out; as the mail carriers now need to know when batteries are included, since lithium ion ones became such a burning issue, literally, when damaged.

The torch itself: it feels and exudes quality materials when handled and taken apart to insert the batteries, like the Inova and much better than the supermarket cheap alloy ones; and will take more knocks and drops without harm to the casing and circuitry. The on/off switch is good and positive, but wait, whats this? It seems a bit hit and miss as to whether you switch the torch on and it provides light, or you get something reminiscent of a disco strobe light. The box diagrams indicate a high light, medium light or flashing light; I can cycle through the 3 settings and the continuous light ones I cant see a difference in brightness and then theres the strobe effect! Im still struggling to think of one occasion that Id need this other than to blind an assailant, or duck tape it to the handlebars of my bicycle to use at night to warn oncoming traffic of my presence! Ok, now Ive thought of two. I wonder if theyll produce a version with a bicycle handlebar clamp?

How bright is the light? Very, especially if you accidentally shine it in your own eyes. For several minutes youll be able to see a blue square of the LED imprinted on your retina. So use carefully and don't let the children loose with it!

Is it good for seeing with? Yes, and so it should be the box says that it produces 400 lumens; one of those measures that don't mean a lot to most folks, me included; and it says the batteries are powering a 5W LED! My floodlight for DIY tasks is only 10W. The Inova, apparently, produces 31 lumens; and yes, it looks dim compared to this one; and even the supermarket ones weak when compared. Itll easily light up a large room. If you remove the lanyard its quite stable when stood upright to bounce the light off the ceiling during a power cut. Can it light up the garden when shone out the window at night to see whats prowling around? Yes.

Of course, youll have to take my word for it, as taking photographs of the torch in use don't really cut it, even the best digital camera isn't as sensitive as the human eye in capturing detail and information; especially for something that is designed to be used when its dark! So youll have to be satisfied with a few snaps of the torch itself being unwrapped.

So, is it the sort of torch that youd miss if you had one, then were unlucky enough to lose it? Definitely.

Should you buy one? If the price is right for you and for what you want to use it for, yes.

Now the important bit that Anker ask me to include: I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.",1

I got this for  my quads. I had a bad fall a few years ago. I didn't realize I had injured myself as badly as I did, till I tried to ride a bike and couldn't pedal. I am using this for a little at home therapy to massage my Quads. I have noticed a difference, although I don't know if I can completely recover after having let the injury go untreated for so long. I also like this for my back. I am not strong enough to do it the way they show in their diagram. When I use it, I place it on my yoga mat to help it not slip, and then I just lean back against it. I gradually roll my back against it until my torso is off the ground. I then roll back and forth a few times. It really gets the kinks out. For my quads I get into a plank position, with the roller under my thighs. I can then roll back and forth slowly massaging my upper leg. I have also found a few other exercises on youtube to use for my quads with the Shape Ape. I have to say it takes getting used to, kind of like a deep tissue massage.

"After careful measuring and comparing, I thought this would be the perfect size. Teeny bigger than 24""s and a little smaller than the 28""s.  However, when I opened it, it just seemed too big and when I looked on box and measured, I saw that it was what the box said: 27.5 x 20.5 x 20.5.  It was not the measurements listed on Amazon. Probably not a big deal for most but for some of you are measuring your  cars etc.. to get one that fits so I figure you would want to know.  For my new 13lb long legged rescue mutt, the 24"" will be plenty big and will be a better fit in  the back seat of our Mazda CX5.  The crate seems great.  It was a little tricky to put the top rail together but it did go and would probably seem easy after first attempt. This one does not have accessories pockets or mat inside.",0
"Disclosure: I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.

The Powerline+ line of cables are very well made, with a braided fabric wrap around the exterior. This makes it feel very heavy duty, but also makes it very stiff. Although a bonus with that is that I have not had this cable tangle at all. The USB plugs themselves feel very sturdy as well. This also comes with a nice little magnetic closure case, with Velcro loop for storage or length management inside.

The only USB C device I currently own is the Nexus 6P. This cable does perform rapid charging with my phone's power brick.

Anker is my go to company for any type of USB cables, but the Powerline+ feels like a much more durable cable than any other I have ever used. They also come with that cool little case I mentioned, which is a nice little bonus (unless you get the 10 ft. Lightning Powerline+, that one does not for some reason).

This is a solid cable that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to anyone looking to buy a replacement or extra cables.",1

"I purchased this Mako the shark dog toy for my two 6-month-old boxer puppies.  My puppies are very hard on their toys.  Normally, soft toys have a hole in the seam with stuffing coming out in no time, so I am always on the lookout for well-made, durable products that will hold up for more than five minutes.  This toy is described as being good for aggressive chewers, so I had high expectations for Mako the shark.  Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.
When I took Mako out of the box, I was surprised by its material.  It was kind of stiff, and I really thought that it was difficult to move my hand in the puppet mouth.  I originally thought this was a good thing because perhaps this toy really was durable and would last.  The puppies were very excited when they saw Mako.  They immediately started biting him as I had the toy on my hand.  Like I said before, because I found the puppet mouth difficult to move with my hand, I do not feel like the toy was very interactive as stated.  I took the toy off of my hand and let the boys play with it.  Within about five minutes, they had pulled off one of the fins.  They were playing tug of war with each other when this happened; however, I expect more durability out of a toy at this price point.
If you have a dog that is easy on their toys, you will like this for its uniqueness.  However, if you have a dog that is hard on toys, this is not the product for you.

"I am very happy with the Foneso bike lock. For the price you get a very high quality bike lock that should do a great job at wording off bike thieves. I have watched many youtube videos done by many different people that investigate what bikes get stolen and why. I was surprised at how many people left there bikes unlocked or used just those thin cord locks. A lock like this Foneso bike lock has think chain links and requires more effort so a thief is more likely to go on to still another bike and not mess with this. The Foneso bike lock has a neat feature to change the lock combination and it is simple to perform. You just open the lock, slide over the ring on the combination side, change your combination to the desired numbers and than just twist the ring back and you are all set. I have had zero issues with the combination setting and use of this lock. I like that the chain links are covered by the sheath. It helps keep down noise and helps prevent the chain from smacking against my bike.

"I absolutely LOVE this mortar and pestle set! Prior to purchasing this item for personal use in my kitchen, I had only used them to compound medications at the clinic I had worked at. There is something so incredibly soothing about using one of these.
I had always seen them being used as a kitchen tool on cooking shows, but had never personally used one for food preparation.
One day I decided ""Hey, why not buy one of my favorite tools at work and put it to use in my kitchen as well!?""
I am so happy I did!

 I love the deep bowl design. Plenty of room to mix and easy to use.

 Very heavy weight, made of smooth granite.

 Beautifully crafted, solid design. When not in use, it is a nice decorative piece as well.

 Easy to clean and care for.

 As far as care and cleaning, one thing to note is to not use soap. The granite will absorb the soap, possibly contaminating your food. All that is needed is a rinse of hot water, and then put in some kosher salt or white rice to absorb the moisture. So, so simple!

The first thing I made was my guacamole!
Using the mortar and pestle made preparing it so much easier and quicker. No more chopping cilantro and garlic, just throw it in the bowl and mash it up! I'm also planning on grinding up some steel cut oats to add to a homemade body scrub soon.

I highly recommend this set to anyone who loves to cook, or those who are looking to learn how to use a unique tool in their kitchen.

"As a Taste of Home Volunteer Field Editor, I received the Debbie Meyer Cake Cutter in both the U-Shape and V-Shape in exchange for an honest review. These cake cutters do work very well. The V-shape cake cutter was easy to use and you can easily adjust the size of your piece of cake. My cake was very moist so the cutter squished it a little bit at the middle and it didn't make a clean cut. Also, it was awkward to put the cake on the plate. Most of the time I want to lay a wedge shaped piece of cake on its side to serve it, and this cutter made it a little tricky to do that. The square/rectangular cutter was also easy to use. It cut each slice perfectly, and I was able to adjust the size of the piece easily. Each slice was cut neatly and looked great served.
I really liked how easy these cake cutters are to use and that they are not sharp, making it safe to have around my kids at a birthday party. You only need to cut the cake, squeeze slightly to lift, and put on a plate. They are also easy to clean. However, they are a little bulky. I live in a small house and they will take up a lot of room in my drawer when not in use.",1
"I purchased the Naztech MagBuddy Magnetic Air Vent Car Mount to use in my 2014 Honda Accord.  I have previously used a device that was suctioned to the window and it left a mark and fell off sometimes in the hot Florida heat.  I am using the product with a iPhone 6s with an iHome case that has room to store your ID credit cards and money behind the phone (it is thick).  The product comes with good directions and is very easy to install.  You just have to assemble to pieces to make the piece that attaches to your vent which was easy for me.  It was putting a ball into a tight area.  The you attach a magnet anywhere on your case or phone (anywhere that you feel comfortable).  I have it installed in my case that slides opens to hold money.  It is thin and doesn't take up much room.

When I went to install the piece into my car - I just unscrewed the ball joint (I have no idea if this is really what it is called) to get it in the correct position and then tightened it back up and then applied pressure to slide it into my air vent.  I then set my phone on it and it held very well.  I realized it wasn't in the exact position I wanted - so I took the phone off (very easily) and readjusted the position of the vent magnet piece.  I have been able to use it to hold my phone in a great position for GPS.  It has only come off once and I really think that was because my son put it on there and it wasn't positioned over the magnet very well.

"MagSafe was one of the more interesting parts of owning my first MacBook back in 2012. Coming from a Sony laptop, I was amazed by the ingenuity that had gone into making that little magnetic break-away safety feature. Im pretty sure it has protected my bulky classic MacBook Pro from disaster a couple of times. Then I switched to this beautiful little laptop called the MacBook in 2015. While its a gorgeous marvel of engineering and design, it is unfortunate that the specification for the USB-C port used for charging doesnt leave room for a similar mechanism.

This is where Griffins BreakSafe USB-C cable replacement comes in. Simply put, its a replacement for the white USB-C to USB-C cable that goes between the Apple-included charging brick and your laptop. One of the ends of this cable employs a mechanism not too dissimilar to Apples MagSafe to protect your laptop from accidental yanks.

Since the laptops body does not include any magnets around the charging port, the BreakSafe plug that goes is split into two parts. One of these parts is a little nub that actually plugs into your laptop and the other end is connected to the cable itself. This way, the cable itself can split (and attach again magnetically) if someone happens to trip on your cable.

I have been using a free sample unit sent to me for review for a couple of weeks now.

The idea is great, but the design could use some work. I have a few comments:

1. First of all, the plug that fits into the laptop itself is bulky. I totally understand if its an engineering restriction to accommodate USB-C compliant components along with the magnets required to function. But keep in mind as a prospective user that it looks a little tacky when plugged in.
2. The cable is thicker and stiffer than Apples cable. This may mean that its sturdier in the long run. However, the stiffness causes it to easily disconnect during regular use. It does not happen frequently enough to be annoying, but it still happens enough times every single day. Expect it to fall off when you turn your MacBook to face someone else, or when picking it up and moving it. If you don't keep it plugged in much, its not a deal-breaker.
3. The black color of the cable looks really out of place. Firstly, it doesnt look natural with an Apple product, which usually come with all white cables. And secondly, it doesnt match Apples power brick that it also connects to.

Barring these issues, this product has a lot of potential.

Either way, the Griffin BreakSafe makes for some really solid insurance. It has already saved my laptop from disaster at least once, when someone tripped over my cable really hard. But considering the long battery life on these ultraportable laptops, its not hard to have a nice charging schedule that avoids the need for being plugged in while working.",1

As someone who believes we should treat our environment with the utmost respect, recycling is very important to us, so this seemed like a brilliant idea. Why wouldnt we support a company who makes their entire product from a recycled product?

--  The color-coded system is brilliant and we each have our own bag. We are using our Click-It bags to hold our emergency supplies as we live in an area with terribly unpredictable weather, and should a disaster strike, we need to be able to leave right away.

--  Each bag is 14 inches by 10 inches so it is perfect to hold an emergency amount of supplies.

--  Because the bags click together, they stay together. No more rummaging through a large plastic container looking for everyone's individual bag. They are all hanging together, ready to go in case of an emergency.

--  The zippers do not feel cheap or flimsy. I feel confident they will last.

--  Each bag has a middle mesh panel allowing air to circulate. I especially like that feature as it prevents that stale and musty smell I have sometimes experienced with solid plastic storage bags.

Honestly, I could go on, but we are genuinely 100% pleased with our Click-It Closet Organizers and they are serving us well. I would not hesitate to recommend them to my fellow Amazon users.

"These tongs are the best I've ever owned! They're much better quality than I was expecting for the price. The lock works well and is easy to use. I've now used them 10 or so times to cook chicken, and I've put them on the top rack of my dishwasher every time. Still look and feel brand new. The silicone mitt is nice too, although I don't use it much. It's thicker than I thought it would be, so it does keep me from getting burned on hot dishes from the oven, etc. All in all, I feel like I got more than my money's worth!",0
"My 3 year old daughter loves her sandwiches, but half the time she is struggling to keep the food in between the pieces of bread. Once I stumbled across this on Amazon I thought what a great idea! There are two separate pieces that work together: the crust cutter and the edge rounder. I use various sizes of bread, and it works well on all of them.

You do have to press firmly for it to go all the way through the bread. I did notice if I tried to use it on a plate or anything other than a flat surface that it did not cut and round completely. I would highly recommend this to make sandwich eating so much easier for kids.",0
"The wallet is functional and it's RFID blocking feature is worth the asking price alone, but I can't get over the cheap material they used. It seems durable enough, but feels extremely cheap. I also wouldn't trust the neck loop to hold up under strain, it feels like one good tug would set it free. I have, instead, been using it as a front-pocket wallet for the past week or so. In this role it works well enough to hold my ID, Insurance card and a credit card with room for a few bills in the back. That's about all you'll squeeze in there if you want it to close.

"The jury is still out on this product. It is cute and is pretty quiet. As far as catching the bugs, either I do not have any in the house or they don't want to go near this zapper. I could probably put it outside but I don't think that I want to do it. I will continue to use it this summer. I love the neon green color and it is very lightweight so it can be moved from room to room.

"My sister's dog knows this is for her the very minute it comes out of  the box. She is a miniature pincher with a lot of bark from everyone often waking I up the new baby. The instructions were easy to follow and it fits her well. The best thing about it is we don't have to shock her at all. It actually vibrates or pulses which is good

"I have used screen protectors before and this is a good one!  First of all, you get a two-pack, so that means you get 2 tempered glass screen protectors, 2 wet wipes, I dust cloth, and 2 sets of guide stickers with dust-absorber.  That was like having insurance in case you messed up the first application.  It was very easy to apply on my iPhone 6s, so I didn't mess up.  The first time I laid the glass down I wasn't happy with the alignment, and it was easy enough to remove the glass and re-align the placement.  No bubbles.  The glass has curved edges and it doesnt fit the phone screen surface all the way to the edges, but I prefer that.  That way, it doesnt interfere with the phone case, so with the glass screen protector and the phone case, you actually get better protection on your phone.  My grand-daughter likes to use my phone---a lot---and she tends to get smudges on my phone and screen.  It is very easy to clean them off the tempered glass.

"My husband and I love our deck. In the mornings we are able to enjoy the sunrise with our breakfast and coffee. In the evenings we can enjoy dinners and drinks on the deck since the direct sun is on the other side of the house. However, after  the sun goes down, our only choice was to turn on the patio lights, which always seemed to draw in the bugs. I wanted light, but I wanted something different than our bright buggy porch lights. This 20 ft strand of 30 LED globe lights really filled that need. This string of small solar powered lights is decorative and does not seem to draw in bugs like the larger brighter porch lights did. There are so many ways you can decorate with them, since they don't require electricity, giving you more freedom to decorate in places where outlets are not available. The attached solar panel collects the energy throughout the day, and the lights will automatically come on at dusk and turn off at dawn as long as you've kept the power switch on the back of the panel on. There is also a mode button on the back of the panel that lets you choose between having the lights blink it stay steady on. These lights have survived several thunderstorms already and have continued to function perfectly. While hanging clips do not come with the lights, I found the clips to be a great way to attach the lights to our sun sail for a fringed look during the day and a consistent lighting along the entire seating area at night. These lights are just like other light strings, however, if you don't want to mess with clips, you can simply drape them over branches or wrap them around railings. Either way, if you want to stake the solar panel in the ground, you can attach the removeable stake to the back of the solar panel to keep it in place at ground level. I was extremely happy with all aspects of these lights and will probably be buying more of them very soon. This light decorating is both beautiful and addictive!

Very well made product.,0
"Quite a nice set. I was very impressed with the quality of workmanship. I like that a safety light can be reduced to be so small, lightweight, and yet very bright. With the 5 LEDs per unit, they will give a warning light that is very visible. They are very easy to operate and can be used on the back of a bike, on a back pack, and in a host of other situations where a warning or caution light is needed. I like it tow extra standard CR2032 batteries are included  beyond the three that come with it. This is a nice touch. And the extra accessories  a mini-screwdriver and Velcro strips for mounting. They are sealed well, are durable, and I found them to be very reliable. Off, on, flash, and strobe  these are the basic modes needed. I like it that I can carry them as a backup light in my backpack when I go walking or biking. They little mighty lights are keepers.

Very nice and just as described. Only issue is that once it is put together the tiers are not as steady as I would've hoped because they are still able to twist and turn around a little.  Didn't want to over tighten the tiers in fear of stripping the screws or the fact that I may not be able to untighten them for disassembly.  Makes a very nice showing.,0

"Update: I have been using this for 2 years and it's just as great as it was when I first got it.

I'm really excited about this minimalist wallet. It's probably meant for men, but I have been on a downsizing kick. I'm constantly going through my stuff and getting rid of what I don't need. My bulky wallet was taking up too much room in my purse. This one is perfect. I feel that my stuff will stay more organized in there as well. As you can see from the pictures, it's a vast improvement. I fit it all into the minimalist wallet, then took some stuff out I didn't need. I like the sport feel to it as well. The bungees are strong and really hold my stuff in tight. I no longer have the fear that everything is going to fall out, like I did with my other wallet. I'm very happy with my purchase and will probably use this for many many years to come. I received this wallet at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Like you, I rely on reviews to make my purchases. I hope this one helps!",1
"As a top reviewer for Amazon, I'm always trying to refine and improve the pictures/videos I take/make. A lot of the time the camera picks up on unwanted backgrounds, particles, lint, dust, and uneven table surfaces ... or simply some products are just hard to take a photo of, and having a riser, aka a stand, is so helpful when trying to showcase a product.

These risers from Combination of Life are just what I need, and I've already used them today for another review to showcase a car charger, which worked perfectly!

They are made from thick Acrylic and come double sealed with a protective layer to prevent scratching while in transport. They are very sturdy and feel very high quality and when you bend them, they feel extremely strong and did not feel like they would snap.

The sizes are:
Small riser: 3 x 3 x 3 inches
Medium riser: 4 x 4 x 4 inches
Large riser: 5 x 5 x 5 inches

I find all of them will work fantastic for a variety of products ranging from many sizes.

The only issue is dust and fingerprints seem to love these stands... and the camera loves picking up on imperfections, so I'll have to keep a microfiber cloth on hand before snapping those photos to rid away any unsightly marks.

"I was excited about getting this handbag because I have been searching for a light pink drawstring handbag. But the material is sooo lightweight that it makes me wonder about the quality. I would like the material to be thicker because it makes for an awkward fit when you actually put items like a wallet in the handbag. I like the color but I am not really impressed with the product.

I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. As your can see, receiving a product at a discount does not influence the number of stars I give it. I always keep it honest and tell it like it is. If you found this review to be helpful, then please vote to let me know. Thanks! ",1
"The package was apparently pre-opened and the box came with the broken sticker.  I wonder if they were previously returned items.  The bride has a loos head, and the cap doesn't stay on.  They seem to function so far, so I will still keep them, but I was disappointed with the loose head.  I like the size H 2.87""* W 1.1"".  I put some music and the transfer speed was just fine.

"I received this case in purple and I really like the fit as well as the design.  There are similar cases on the market that do not fit your phone exactly. The fit is exact and it is not an awkward or bulky in any way. The silicone piece that holds your phone inside the case has button covers and the correct cut out for the two microphones, speaker, and charger abd headphone ports. It also has a recessed cut out for the camera lens and flash . There is a slot inside the flip style housing to keep a credit or debit card along with an ID, if you needed to run in somewhere quickly and didn't want to bother with carrying a purse or bag with all of its contents. This case has a cut out to enable you to see the time and important information on the screen, so you are not constantly having to open and close the cover. It comes in 5 very nice colors and the purple that I received looks exactly like the picture. I am very excited to have gotten a chance to test this product and review it.

"From the picture the bag looks like canvas. In person it also looks like canvas but is truly a very soft smooth leather. I am a teacher so I like bags that I can fit file folders in, along with books, notebooks, pens etc.

Other reviewers commented on the size of the bag and having difficultly putting the bag on their shoulder. I did not expierence that problem.  I may not have had a problem because  I am petite. However, I generally don't hold a bag of this size that is packed with stuff on my shoulder.

Yesterday was the first time I used it and took it out with me to doctor appointments and the mall.  I received so many compliments on my bag from coach toting people.  It looks and feels expensive.

Another reason I love this bag is because it has inner pockets. 1 zips and the other side are pouches. There is also a pouch on the side of the bag so you can easily access keys or cards. Etc.

I received a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.  The attached pictures show the bag holding standard size file folders.

The purse arrived quickly and was packaged extremely well. There was no creases from shipping. Overall, a great value.",1

So far so good. I haven't found any mice in the house. It seems to be keeping them out pretty well.  The first setting you cannot hear the second setting is ear piercing so I would not recommend that when somebody  is home. 3 and 4 kind of sounds like a saw it doesn't hurt your ears but if you're watching a movie or something I could see it being annoying 5 and 6 will make you run those hurt! nobody needs to be around for those maybe a vacant house up for sale or for rent. I have noticed that they work great on mice but I really haven't seen any difference with roaches or spiders so I'm not sure if it works really well with them or if I'm just using it on the wrong setting. I will still keep trying but I definitely recommend it especially if you live out on a farm I've noticed it does keep the flies some other way as long as you keep it plugged in otherwise they're right back.

"I truly like this notebook cover. It even smells good, a bit like leather. It comes with a standard notebook that is actually very functional as is - but it is easily changeable for a planner or schedule notebook. It has space for pens (or pointers that are the size of pens), business cards, important papers, a slim phone. As an adult, I can tell you a small notebook like this that fits inside a standard size purse (or your laptop bag) is perfect to attend conferences, seminars or meetings. You know how you have to take notes, exchange (or receive) business cards, have quick access to pens and a place for receipts that you may need to get reimbursement. If you don't want to carry a purse and just the notebook - you can tuck the phone in the velcro pocket. It even has a little space for a memory card - in case you are also needing to transport a presentation or whatever stored documents. This cover has space for all of that. Plus it looks classic, sleek and unisex: it will work for any gender preferences. I also like the stitching throughout. It is very tasteful. The color is neutral so it will easily match any outfit - if that is a consideration. This canvas material is wipable but it could stain if you spill black coffee and don't clean it up right away.

I received this notebook from the vendor for review and evaluation.",1
"Installation: Was easy to install using the paper template provided to cut the door. Sticks to the door with 3M adhesive that is already placed on the product for you.

Quality: The material is strong and stuck to the door well. You could paint the product if you like (it ships as white and doesn't need paint unless you want to change the color).

Use: Our cat was suspicious for about 10 minutes and now he loves it (see photo).

Overall: I like the appearance a lot, judge for yourself on this one. I'd recommend this to anyone who needs an interior cat door. In our case, this door is a closet that has the cat's liter box so it's very nice to keep that door closed.",0
"This battery is awesome. I have an iPhone 5s and I can charge it all the way about 3 times using this battery. It take a while once it's dead to get a full charge again, but it's totally worth it. I use it more than I use a wall outlet. After a few months it wouldn't charge all the way anymore so I emailed the manufacturer and the sent me another one. I have had the second one much longer than the first with absolutely no problems. I have really got my money's worth out of this and am appreciative of their awesome, fast customer service.",0

"I really love the design of this bag. The colors and design stands out and looks very attractive. The bag is well built with perfect stitching and heavy duty zippers. This laptop sleeve has amazing built quality. It's made durable from the outside and soft plush used inside. The thick interior plush padding will protect your device. The bag uses dual zippers and the zippers works perfectly without giving any issue. It comes with a small accessory case; it's perfect to keep the power cable in there or the mouse. My laptop fits perfectly inside and can be taken out with ease. I have tried 2 different laptops and both fitted in perfectly. Overall, I would recommend this product.

"These shoes are hip and trendy.  I got the black pair that has white stitching, brown trim and a white sole. The laces are black and white!  The stitching is nice on these.  The shoes seem well made.  These would look cute in the fall with jeans.  But could be worn with shorts or other pants.  They would even look cute with some skirts.  Women or men could wear these.  They are lightweight and comfortable to wear.  My teen would wear them but they don't have bigger sizes (he has a big foot).  These are cute and would be great for school starting soon!

"I ordered this lace crochet-trim swimsuit cover for my daughter's birthday. We still have a few more weeks till her big day, but I let my other daughters check it out and they are all envious and want one for themselves. It is made of light and airy fabric that gives you some coverage without sacrificing the breath-ability of hanging out in a swimsuit. The crochet lace details add such a fun romantic bohemian feel to your outfit. This is definitely a win. I might have to buy a few more for my other daughters, and me too. I think it is the cutest swimsuit cover I have seen.

"I am very happy with these blackout curtains. These curtains help keep our room more cooler by keeping the sun out. I am sure when winter comes it will also help keep our room warmer and help keep draft and cold out. These curtains are pretty wide and long. Which nice when you have tall and wide windows. These curtains has strips of material on the back so you can put your rod in this way or you can pass the rod directly through the curtain itself. Each way makes it look different. So it depends on your style how you want to do it. I am one of them one people that dislike getting woke up by the early morning sun rise and these sure do help keep the sun from shine in and waking me up. It keeps my room dark. You get two blackout thermal panels to a set. It has a nice Thermal-Lined on the back. Over all i am very excited with these curtains. They are great to have all though out your home.  The only problem I have with these is the color does not match the photos on amazon  (which for me is not really a problem  but could be for someone) they say they are a teal color  but  we received a darker almost navy blue color  but they still work and look great..

"These shorts are so comfortable & soft! I got the Midnight Dream Black shorts in the X-Large size (I usually wear a size 12 in bottoms). If you're looking for a tighter fit, you *might* get away with ordering one size down because of the stretchy waist and drawstring. Obviously the model is wearing a different size and we don't know how tall she is, but I'm 5'2 and the shorts are still short, but not as short in the picture (which doesn't bother me at all but wanted to mention it for those who want super short shorts). Also, the pockets are definitely big enough to actually put stuff in so they're perfect for anytime use. The quality is really amazing! I don't expect any loose threading any time soon. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.",1
"I was so surprised when these arrived because they are so large!  They are quart size!  They are wonderful.  Solid glass that feels thick and sturdy.  They have reusable lids which are great for storage purposes.  They make a great drinking glass for a fun change too!  I really like these.  They have a 2 inch opening in the top, making them a little tricky to clean if you are putting thick drinks in them and not rinsing them out immediately afterwards.  They are darling and would make a great centerpiece vase as well!  I'm thrilled, they are perfect!  I filled mine with raspberry lemonade to beat the heat!

"With my 18+ year old male dog I swear by belly bands.  He just can't control his bladder as well as he use to.  On top of that, I've been fostering various dogs for the last 12 years through a local rescue and belly bands are essential for the male dogs when I don't know their potty habits yet or for housebreaking.  Belly bands have saved my house more times than I care to count.

I am a fan of these bands specifically too.  I have tried numerous others and used to get them custom made where I got to pick my pattern and exact size, but gosh that gets expensive.  Especially since it's good to have several on hand so you can have them in the wash if needed and still have others to use, so it's great that these come in a 4 pack.  For the price, these are hard to beat.

They say the patterns are assorted but I got the exact ones pictured which I was very happy about since they are adorable.  And, in fact, they look even nicer in person.  They have a little bit of elastic which I normally don't like since it makes a lot of bands bunch up on my dog, but on these it's just subtle enough where it isn't bunching which is fantastic!  The material does feel like it may attract dog hair, but it is also soft and breathable so it's very comfortable on my pup.

My only complaint is that is seems odd that my 18 pound terrier wears a size ""large"".  Normally he is a ""medium"".  That said, the actual measurements are very accurate so definitely measure your pup and go by those when selecting a size.

I like to use&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TENA-Serenity-Ultimate-Pads-36-Count/dp/B00J4YWG6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TENA Serenity Ultimate Pads, 36 Count</a>&nbsp;cut in half for inside the belly band (see photo).  If they get soiled all you have to do is throw away the pad and put a new one in.  Super easy and sanitary.

"First, so you know, my music preferences are easy listening, country and bluegrass and my review is based on listening to music of those genres.

My thoughts regarding this headset:

1.  The sound  is good for casual listening.  In fact, for $18, the price at the time of this review, the sound is very good. I am listening as I type this and enjoying it.  The voices of the singers are pretty much as expected, including those with deep voices.

2.  Volume will likely  be an issue with those who  prefer their music real loud.  Songs that are normally loud are loud enough, but those that are not could be louder.  I listen to audio books when on the treadmill at the gym and the volume is not sufficient for me to hear the reader without straining when the gym speaker is playing music.  Audio book readers are harder to hear than music.

3.  The controls are on the wire below the ""right"" earpiece, about even with my jaw line.  There are 3 control buttons:  power/play/pause/call; + volume/next track; -/go back.  Long press for volume change, short press for track change

The buttons are large and well spaced and very easy to use

4.  Fit for me is fine.  The earbud are positioned next to the ear canals and the
earpieces feel secure on my ears.  I can run, jump, and shake my head without any movement on the part of the earbuds.

But I know from experience that with headsets of this design you don't know for sure how they will fit until you put them on.

5.  Pairing was quick and easy (BT).  Two phones can be paired simultaneously.  Pairs on red/blue flashing, but it is easy cover the light with your thumb or finger when pressing the power button

6. The headset charges fast, 1-2 hours according to the specifications.  But play time is short, 3 hours or less.  However, for $18 I still think this headset is a good value, providing you are not depending on them for extended listening.

Wearing them for an hour or two at the gym, they are a good choice because they are so secure.  But remember to charge them when you get home.

Included with the headset are a charge cable, pair of earbud covers, and a user guide in Chinese and English that is OK, but the print is very small and hard to read without a magnifying glass.

I received the JBM Arms Compression Sleeve recently and I am happy with the product. I received the white compression sleeve and I use the sleeve while I am at the gym and while at work. The use of the sleeve helps for some of the pain that I have throughout the day from old injuries playing sports in high school and college and after having a hyper extension injury to my arm that could have serious and having the residual pain was a blessing although at times hard to deal with. So using this sleeve has helped me immensely and given me the some relief while at work.  I could definitely see people using this product for anything athletic or even wearing while doing activities that cause discomfort and pain of the arm or elbow. The compression sleeve works well although when I received the JBM sleeve I tried it on and it was just a little tighter than I expected. Besides that the sleeve works out well. Its made of great quality and I think it will last longer than I expect. The only issue I have is that the compression sleeve does not fit as well as I thought it should. Although it does stretch very well for a conforming fit I found that sometimes it was a little tight for my arm. This could have been an issue with me getting an accurate arm measurement. Overall the quality of the product is great and the capabilities of use of the sleeve are awesome. I recommend this product to anyone who has had arm pain either from an injury or excess wear and tear on their elbow joint. I received the JBM Arms Compression Sleeve at a discount or free for my honest review.,1
"Mountain House reminds me of backpacking with my dad when I was 10 through high school (I'm 28 now). So, when I convinced my girlfriend to come backpacking with me, I told her freeze-dried food was part of the experience and picked up a variety of these.  While there are a few brands to choose from, Mountain House has always been the standard for me because:

1. They actually taste fantastic
2. They're very easy to make
3. They're surprisingly affordable

When its pouring rain and you just hike over boulders with a 30-40lb pack for an entire day, Mountain House meals are easy to prepare and taste better than they should.  Don't change a thing, I can't wait to share these same meals with my kids when they're old enough to camp.

Just make sure you're patient and follow the directions - if you dig into them too fast you'll burn your mouth and the food will still be crunchy.",0
"Both my little girl AND my cat love this little toy!

It was so so easy to snap together- and even with a ten month old throwing it around its stayed together perfectly.

I got the green color and I really love it!

Easy, durable, cute, and evidently lots of fun!

I definitely recommend!

"These cracked glass solar lights looks great and works as expected. There is a ON /OFF switch inside the lid which you have to turn ON first before using them. And make sure that you place them in area with ample sunlight.
The light is not very bright but just enough to get your attention.

The quality however is not that great, I suspect that they will not last long considering the environmental factors such as rain and wind.

"This dress is freaking awesome!  I ordered it for my daughter for her birthday and she was over the moon!  It is so pretty... seems very well made for a dress up costume!  The colors are vibrant and it fits perfectly.  I imagine we'll also be using this for Halloween this year.  In fact, she loves the dress so much she asked to wear it for school pictures and I thought you know - why not?  So we did!  I can't say enough good about this - super cute, exactly as described, well made... made my girl happy!  I received this product at a slight discount in exchange for my true and honest review.",1

"Super comfortable boots! Come in many different colors and styles (the quilted boots and zebra ones too) The run kind of small, so. I would say go up half a size. I haven't had them long enough to see if I had the same issues that some have had with the boots splitting or ripping. The pockets on the boots can fit cards, money, etc. The zippers in them go up and down without issue. I did put some WD40 to make it more easier.

"This was unisex trimmer is better than I expected. If you are looking for something to support the back and workup a great sweat then this is for you. Below I suggest how you can get the most out of this waist trimmer but for now let me tell you about my experience with this waist trimmer. This trimmer is great for working out and wearing for a few hours a day to support the back.  I ordered the Large/ X-Large. The L/XL is 42 inches long and 8 inches in tall for the highest part of the trimmer. I made sure to measure it.

The unisex trimmer breakdown:
1. This trimmer come in 2 sizes S/M and L/XL
2. There 1 large Velcro band and 1 small Velcro band
3. Both Velcro bands are adjustable
4. The fabric is very sturdy and durable
5. It focuses on lower back and torso
6. The 4 flex compression helps to support back

Activities I did with waist trainer:
1. 15 minutes on treadmill
2. 45 minutes on stair master
3. 15 minutes weightlifting
4. Wore for 3 hours during work

My dislikes:
 I dislike that there are only 2 sizes I wish it was broken down separately

My Likes:
 I like how  sturdy the fabric is, it seems like it will last for more a long amount of time
 I like the flex bones because they help the lower back to stay upright while walking or working out
 I like that it is unisex so both men and women can where it
 I like that it stays in place and does not move around while working out

TIPS How to get the most out of this waist trimmer:
1. Use this waist trimmer when you work out
2. DO NOT wear it under clothing hoping for a slimmer look because it will appear bulky
3. Size wise if you weigh 180lbs or less get the S/M and if you weigh 181+ or more get the L/XL
4. Know that this is not a waist trainer IT IS A waist TRIMMER its focuses on the lower abs, partial love handles and lower belly pooch
5. It supports the back a little for a temporary amount of time please don't expect for this to work all day like a back brace because it is not
6. It feels okay against the skin but I suggest wearing a camisole and putting the trimmer on top of the camisole or wrap your stomach with saran wrap then place the trimmer on top it so the trimmer doesnt irritate the skin

This is a good product for a person who workouts or looking for a little back support for a few hours a day. I would recommend this product to a family member or friend. It is worth exactly what you pay for it.

"I personally LOVE this iphone case. The case is pretty, bordering a fantasy style castle scene, and it's interesting . I doesn't look childish, and it's not plain jane, it's just right in my opinion.
The thing I REALLY like about the case now:
The design is slim enough you can fit your iphone 6 into a runner's sleeve or runner's belt, without any hassle. It also fits into my phone wallet with ease, a little snug, but I like the fact that there's not a chance it will fall out, but leaves me easy access to get my phone out without difficulty.
The case STAYS ON! My biggest complain about iphone cases is they don't stay on, and if you turn your phone, there's a chance of it slipping out of the case. This is not a problem with UrSpeedtekLive iPhone 6 case.
There's a bumper all the way around the phone to help protect edges and corners in the event you accidentally drop your phone. Some cases do not have this, and those are more for decorative purposes than anything.
This is not as protective as the fully encased ""box"" style cell phone cases, and if you drop it in the water, it won't be protected -- but I surely did not get this case with that in mind. I don't plan on dropping my phone in the water anytime soon (as in-- ever).
I just wanted general protection and a case that actually stayed together and ON my phone, which is what I got!
I received this product free in return for an honest and unbiased review, which I have given.",1
Beware! There isn't any ventilation. It makes the body feel hot and uncomfortable! It would be a better product if it had ventilation holes in the foam queen pad to breath. I sent it back for an exchange for a ventilated pad.,0

"This looked like a good item for my wife, it was very sturdy but poorly made. The rod that closes the cutters fell off the handle less than 5 minutes after we opened the package. We did not even get a chance to cut any plants or branches before it was broken. This item looks good but be forewarned it's not made well. Save your money and bend over to cut flowers and twigs.",0
"I ordered the Golastartery Vintage Wild Alloy Anchor Multilayer Hand Weave Leather Cuff Bracelet 11 days ago, expecting it to arrive over the next month, but it came today.  I am quite pleased that it arrived so early.  It came in a basic plastic zipper pouch that was inside a bubble envelope, and looks exactly like the picture.  The bracelet part is a flat leather cord, colored on both sides so you don't have to worry about an ugly side showing.  The anchor is very shiny and pretty, and is solid and sturdy that I don't think it'll ever lose it's shape (unless forced).  The bracelet can only be worn as shown in the picture, because of the way the metal is curved, and that puts the anchor right on the top of your wrist (or bottom, if you put it on upside down).  It is a little tight on my wrist if I don't move the knot that makes the loop, but I ordered it for one of my kids, so it'll most likely be loose on them.  Overall, this seems like good quality material, and I'm impressed at the color and overall appearance.  I ordered the light blue, and the color looks just like the photo.  I am very pleased with this product.

"I bought an 18' Bestway steel from pool, but neither of the mounting brackets work with my pool. The frame is more oval so the screw on one keeps popping off and the other one doesn't tighten enough to keep the skimmer from moving/floating.

I purchased this jacket for my job as I have to wear business casual styles clothing. The jacket is very flattering and Paris nicely with pretty much anything. You can wear this blazer with a nice pair of jeans a pair of dress slacks a skirt or even over a dress. The jacket has a little bit of stretch to it and is completely lined. The jacket itself was sicker than I had expected more of a Blazer quality then a cardigan so to speak.

Our last trampoline we didn't not purchase these.

"Very lightweight, powerful suction, easy to use attachments.  This vacuum does not stay charged long enough to do more than one room, or more than a set of stairs.  If you are tall, (I am only 5'7"") it is too short to stand up straight for vacuuming.  So for this reason, it can be hard on your back.  Consider this vacuum for small, quick jobs and you won't be disappointed.  Consider the price if you're only looking for a small, quick job vacuum!  I hope it lasts at least 20 years for this amount of money!",0
"My Bostons LOVE this thing. While it is very sturdy, if they miss and get ""clunked"" it doesn't hurt like a hard plastic frizbe would.

"I ordered a medium in size and they fit well. I did have to turn up the cuff at the wrist to ease the compression; other than that, they fit very well. These gloves are lightweight, silky feeling and provide light compression, without being too restrictive. I really liked that the fingers are open so you don't lose tactile abilities. These are great if you need light compression in your hands, with slight rubber nubs on fingers and palms for assistance with gripping. I recommend these gloves to others and will be purchasing more, so I can leave a set in the car for ease of gripping the steering wheel while driving. These gloves are made of 88% nylon and 12% spandex. They wash up easily. I hand wash mine in cold water but you can machine wash these on delicate cycle.
They are breathable and are high quality. I use these daily and I have felt a difference in my hands while using these gloves. I will purchase these again.

"This Moto x Pure Edition Screen Tempered Glass screen protector works great and was VERY easy to install! I've had many smart phones over the years and installing screen protectors was always a huge pain as I would go through about 3-4 before it looked right. Even then I would still have a bubble or two.  I got this one done in 1 try with NO bubbles!!

Look at my pictures and you'll see the protector came in a hard covered case to keep the product from breaking or cracking. It also came with a wet nap, dry nap and dust absorbent. The only problem is it didn't come with installation directions! Thankfully, it was pretty self explanatory and I think I did it right because my screen looks great -- no bubbles at all.

Here's what to do:
1. Clean your phone screen with the wet nap.
2. Wipe down your phone screen with the dry nap.
3. Use the dust absorbent to pick up any particles the dry nap may have left.
4.  Peel off the screen backing and stick to screen.

The quality of the screen cover is top notch (9H). As a fitness instructor and Mom, I drop my phone at least once every day but this protector has never scratched and has kept my screen in one piece.
I see that others have complained about this not covering the whole screen, but I don't even see how that's possible.  The protector goes to the edge of the clear bumper case that comes with the Moto Pure X phones. The only tiny bit of screen uncovered is at the top by the 'earpiece' and camera.  You wouldn't want it covering those devices anyway.
Even though the protector is pretty thick, I have had no issue with functionality. The touch screen works fantastic like the protector isn't even there.

Bottom line, I would buy this again and highly recommend it especially for those who have had bad experiences with screen protectors in the past like me. This one is by far the best on all accounts!

"I had my good friend Serynne test this product out as it fits her style.  ""Summer is almost here, and I am an outdoorsy goth! As much as I look forward to the sun and heat, my skin screams creature of the night. Searching the internet for ways to protect my creamy white skin from the sun, I was inspired by the porcelain women of the Victorian era and just had to get myself a parasol!

This GORGEOUS, foldable parasol is more than I could have ever asked for. The black inner layer stays cool with the top gold/bronze reflecting the sun's rays! I LOVE the layer of black lace with hints of sparkle for the magical visual appeal of class and charm. The foldable feature with a slip pouch makes it as easy to store in your purse as a small umbrella, or you can leave the lower half 'clicked' down in place and its longer and thinner to store in narrow places. I may as well get one in every color for every occasion! ITS A FAIR GIRLS MUST HAVE OF THE YEAR!

"About the product:
This is a cute bracelet, especially if you're obsessed with anchors or the beach. When it arrived, it took me a minute to try to figure out how to wrap it around my arm and tie it. The metal anchor part only fits with the ancho right in the middle of my wrist. Its not one that you can slide around your wrist. It has to stay exactly like the photo shows. Its cute to wear though!

"I am absolutely giving this hammock five out of five stars.  First of all this hammocks does not say it comes with straps but straps to hang on a tree were included.  Most hammocks of this type come with some rope to secure it to a tree but anyone who messes with hammocks knows the luxury of the tree straps.  This hammock is triple stitched and when I opened it there were no tears or any fabric frayed.  I purchased one before and fresh out of the box it had frayed material.  Needless to say it did not last very long and I have two kids who are rough on everything.

I looked at this one particularly for the fact that it advertised a mosquito netting.  I do a lot of kayaking and always looking for an easy and lightweight way to pack some type of shelter on my kayak.  This would be perfect for a backpacker as well.  The mosquito netting is sewed into the hammock and it open with a durable looking zipper on the side of the hammock.  The package also includes a couple pieces of what looks like 550 cord to use to bring the net up off the user and draw it tight to the trees.  Neat little idea to wrap up a little shelter and protection from the bugs into one package while still giving you the comfort of a parachute style hammock.  I am considering buying a second one to give to a fellow kayak-er as a gift.

I did receive the hammock at a reduced rate in order to provide a review of the product.  I do a lot of reviews on Amazon and very rarely do I give something the full five out of five stars.

I got this in a large due to reading other peoples reviews and I wish I hadn't. Well I wish I could have tried the medium and the large. I feel the medium or the size for my shoe size always HURTS so I ordered a size bigger. It is slightly too loose at first but after standing all day it doesn't HURT like the others. I think its not entirely tight enough to give me the complete compression it is supposed to, however I'd rather not be in pain all day. If it hurts I won't use it, then where does that leave me!",1

"I love waffles. Who doesn't? I also love panini sandwiches and other stuff that is delicious and easy to make. This sucker combines four different cooking options: Waffle, Omelette, Panini Sandwich and Regular Sandwich. They are all nonstick and dishwasher safe, so if you're lazy like me the clean up will be easy and you will have nothing to whine and complain about.

I mostly use this for waffles and thus far is has done excellently. It's closely smoothly, is lightweight and the plates are easy to take in and out. If you like your waffles crispier though, I suggest leaving it a minute or so more than the light tells you to. It cooks waffles to perfection, but I prefer mine with a bit of crunch.

The sandwich press is excellent too, and I was happy to not have to worry about burning my sandwiches or blackening the bread. If you are using thicker bread it's going to be a tight fit, but what can I say? Delicious sandwiches are not for the faint of heart. Get your muscles pumping and ready yourself for a fantastic sandwich.

I received this product at a discount price in exchange for an honest review. All of my reviews are honest, but I'm glad I was able to write a good one. It's a sad day when you have to give a bad review to a waffle maker. Waffles are supposed to be food items of joy. Good luck and happy eating.",1
"I received this product at a discounted price for my opinion. i would've bought this at full price. We are planning a long vacation this summer to a high tourist area. I always wear a cross body purse but sometimes I don't want to carry anything and my hubby will. This is perfect. When he's ""in charge"" of holding all of our stuff, he puts everything in a backpack. Well, traveling on a subway or mass transportation can be tricky with backpacks. The thing I like about this is there are many clips that can be attached to the inner parts of a backpack so it'll be much harder to just grab and run. On that same thinking, it will be a lot easier to find everything we need (credit cards, phone, etc) instead of rummaging thru our bag. It comes with credit card protectors so that's another plus!!  If you do want to just carry this, it comes with detachable straps to use it as a crossbody bag. This is perfect!!!",1

I live in hot, humid Florida, and I always have a water bottle with me, whether I am in the car, out for a run, at work, or wherever.  Water bottles can be bulky and difficult to store, so what appealed to me about these is that they are collapsible.  If they worked as advertised, they would take up much less room in the cabinet, in my luggage, or wherever else I am that they are not currently filled.  I had to give it a try!

They arrived very promptly, and you get two 26-oz water bottles and 2 extra colorful lids.  Great feature!  Should I need to wash out the top/lid, I have a spare ready to go.  You can watch the video I made that shows exactly how they work, but in a nutshell.there is a locking mechanism that you can easily lock and unlock, to allow the button to be pressed to open the lid for drinking.  I love this, because the lid automatically flips open when you press the button, and if you don't want that to accidentally happen if you are in the middle of sports or think you may accidentally hit that button, you simply lock it.  Easy!  It can all be done with one hand.lock, unlock, open, close.

The opening to the bottle is large enough to easily fill it without a funnel, and even large enough to add ice cubes.  Screw the lid on, and the drinking hole is a perfect size where you don't have too much coming out at once, but you're not sucking on it to get a drop.  (I've had both kinds of water bottles!!).  While you are drinking, the smart spring design keeps the cap in place so it won't come back and hit you in the nose!  This product can be put into a dishwasher, but it is recommended that you hand-wash so you don't get a dishwasher smell.  However, warm water gets rid of that odor if it happens.

I am super-impressed with these!  It even comes with cleaning tips, including tips on how to get rid of the hard water ""whitish film"" I always get since I have hard water in my home.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  However, please know that this discount does not in any way affect the words in my review.

"Considering how unimpressed I have been with Bastex's products in the past, I was surprised by the quality of this case. It isn't the best, but it's okay for the price.

PROS
- different color options allow you to customize the look
- feet on the bottom protect it from the surface it's laid on
- cutouts are well-sized for the most part
- comes with wraps on the case to protect in transit

CONS
- feet dig into your hand
- camera cutout is too big

All things considered, this is a nice case. Better than previous Bastex products, but still not as good as competitors'.

"Wow how fast this arrived is incredible!  Ordered it on Sunday afternoon and it arrived Monday morning (you have to just love Amazon Prime!).  Anyway, lets get to reviewing this beautiful Antique Pink replacement band for a 38mm Apple Watch.  I purchased this for a wonderful friend who is as big of an Apple fan, as I am and was tickled 'pink' to receive it as a gift from me.  She gushed about how nice the color matches her favorite color which is a light to pale pink and how elegant she feels her Apple Watch seems to her now with this cool new band.  We looked it over and the material is slightly thinner and more pliable than an original Apple silicone style watch band, but actually that works to her favor, in that she doesn't like a watch band to feel tight or binding.  The snap enclosure 'stud' on the back to keep it on her arm works just like an original and removing her band and attaching this one went (as expected) totally easy and quick.  Now that she is a fan of changing the look of her watch, I expect that she will want to know who I ordered it from so she can look through and purchase other colors to dress up her watch 'wardrobe'.  I will be more than happy to tell her it was through Valuebuybuy and give her the link to their ads on Amazon.  Thanks guys (at Valuebuybuy) for making me shine as a great friend and offering such a wide array of colors of this type of replacement watchband.  See attached pic of her arm proudly showing off her new cool watchband.

"Awesome little pillow!

It is real memory foam and is unbelievably comfortable!

The stretchy band on the back side makes it very easy to throw around the headrest and you can even get it around your head to wear it as a bow tie if you wanted to!

I think this pillow is so comfortable that some people may even use it as a decorative pillow for a bed or couch.

I have been using it as a lower lumbar support against my back in the car because it is nice but has that soft memory foam touch where you sink in and gives me some support and makes the ride to work a little more comfortable.

I highly recommend this product to anyone for whatever their purpose may be! If the pillow catches your eye or will match something in your house give it a try it is awesome!

I received this product in exchange for my own review and hope that it was helpful to anyone that is considering purchasing this product!",1
"Just to clarify, this is NOT 14k Gold!  It is not gold plating; it is simply a gold color.  If it had any gold in it, it would have to be stamped as such.  It is however a high quality tungsten carbide ring.  It comes in a nice box (which is important if you are giving it as a gift).  It does have comfort fit, which fit as expected.  (you typically want to do a half size smaller for the comfort fit design than what you would normally wear).  Being tungsten carbide, it is scratch resistant.  It is very elegant and looks like a real gold ring, but it is not gold; and the tungsten carbide will keep the shine.

Perfect lights for several different uses. These lights are so petite and delicate they can be used anywhere. I love looking on the internet to find projects and reusing these lights over and over.

"I love this Wireless Bluetooth Headsets!!! It fits me very well, even though I have small ears. I like the color and it is very stylish. The headset comes in a nice box with instructions, extra earbuds, and micro USB charging cable.
It is easy to pair up with my phone. This headset has better sound quality than my original Samsung S5 headphones. I was very surprised and impressed of the sound quality when I first played a song using these headsets. I love how I can talk on this headset for more than 5 hours when it is full charged. When I am calling someone on the phone, they can hear me just fine. They actually can hear me better with this headset than when I just using the phone itself.
When turning off/on the headset it does say power off and power on and the light is flashing, on the right side, when it is on every 6-9 seconds. This light turns orange, on the right side, when you turn it off.  I like how this headset flashes light, on the right side, because I always forget to turn off my headset. The flashing light also helps me find the headset, while it is still on, whenever I lose the headset. This headset never fell off when I was running. I always have this headset whenever I go to the park and store.
Overall, I really love this headset. I highly, highly recommend anyone who is interested in this product. I do not have any cons for this product, but I do have a lot of pros! My favorite part of this headset is when it plays a cute song/ringtone when someone is calling me. It always makes me smile because it is so funny to me. I am just not used to hearing that song/ringtone.

"I will start off by saying I'm fat. Blah, blah, blah, fat shaming, blah. I call it like I see it. I have a mirror. I know I'm fat. Does it hurt my feelings when other people tell me I'm fat? They don't, but it wouldn't anyway because I already know I'm fat. I like food, and Kale is not a food. So, if you're going to insult someone successfully, maybe start by telling them something they have no idea about, like their IQ.

On to the boots! The reason for mentioning my size is because I have large calves. No, not the cow, but good attempt at a fat joke. I'll give you that one. My calves are wide, and I was very nervous about these not fitting me. I've read a lot of the reviews, and people say they have no idea what the side zipper is for and that it serves no purpose. Let me just tell you, if it weren't for that side zipper, I would be returning these. That thing saved me postage, and it's the only way I got them on. Once I get the boot over my fat cankles, I just zip them up and bam! They fit perfectly.

I've been wearing these all day long and my feet don't hurt, my hips don't hurt and they also don't lie. They really don't lie. They tell on me.

The boots shoelaces are typical material for these type of boots. If you want shoelaces that are like sneakers, buy those -- but those typically aren't worn on combat boots, I can assure you. How do I know this? Because Google and my brain.

These fit my wide feet as well. I am using thin socks because I hate thick socks. You could feasibly wear thick socks, though. I have plenty of movement with my feet inside. I am a size 9, so I ordered a size 9 and they fit perfectly. It's not tight around my fat ankles, and my toes aren't mashed together.

Why did I purchase these? The pockets. I'm basically a tomboy who wears makeup. Yeah, yeah, I know, you're probably like, ""whatever, you're a girl, blahblahblah, they all say they're different blahblahblah."" I play video games every night until 3am, I work on cars, I am a lowkey gunsmith and I hate shopping -- I also don't own a dress, skirt or heels. Form your own opinion, and then don't tell me about it. I didn't buy these to wear to a coffee shop and purchase a pumpkin spice latte. I bought these because I can fit my knife in one pocket, and whatever else I want in the other. The pockets do fit really tight, so they will need to be stretched out a little bit. You could stuff a sock in there and leave it for a while to stretch things out a bit. I purchased these boots because I want something I can get dirty and not feel bad about it. I go fishing and participate in outdoor activities quite a bit, and I don't want my other shoes to get muddy. I also need protection from snakes on occasion.

The top part of the boot is nice. I don't have to wear tall socks with these (and my socks don't slip down either), and it doesn't rub my calves. If you're plus-sized, these will fit. It depends on how many donuts you ate though, I can't speak for larger than myself. I like donuts also, obviously.

These boots look great with leather leggings and a biker jacket. Now I just need a biker jacket.

I hope you found my review to be amusing. I sure did.

"I. Love. These. Day two, second pair being worn and so far I am VERY happy. Everything fits as expected, the material is soft and gets almost seems to softer as the day goes on. Held up to initial wash well and hoping they continue to do so. Ordering more now. Only complaint it lack of color choices but hey, black is sexy; right?",0
"These curtains are awesome! They are very good quality. It's hard to tell in pictures but they are nice and heavy. They keep out the sun. My room has a large window (see picture below) facing East so mornings can get pretty bright and in the summer it gets hot too. I'm having major surgery soon and the thought of recouping in a room hot and sunny was not a pleasant one. I couldn't be happier with these curtains and I'm glad I bought 2 panels.

"This is a solid little coffee pot for making espresso on your stove top. I use it mostly in the afternoon when I just need a pick-me-up. It brews a nice, strong cup of coffee that can be made into a latte or just cream. It also makes a good strong iced coffee if you let it cool a bit first.

This pot is easy to use. Water goes in the bottom, coffee in the little canister, and it all screws together. You turn your stove on high (mine is a gas stove so I make sure flames aren't licking the sides) and wait for the coffee to percolate. The coffee fills the top chamber and you can pour your cup. I just listen to figure out when it is finished.

This pot seems sturdy overall. I handwash it. After reading other reviews about the handle breaking, I just baby it a little. I am happy with this product and expect it to last a long time with proper care. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I did not allow that to influence my review.",1

"My oldest son loves giraffes and just happened to be in need of a new backpack for school. (On a side  note, his sister lost her water bottle, so this three-in-one deal was just too good to pass up!) The backpack is a good size, holds his notebook and papers and folders. It has lots of extra pockets for smaller items and pencils. The lunch box is so cute, I like that there are two handles. The water bottle is a bit on the smaller side, but it works!

"Bought this light fixture to put in our bathroom. It doesn't need any light bulbs and is supposed to get 45,000 hrs of light from it. It's not a heavy light. Its made of some type of plastic, but not cheap looking. It mounts to the ceiling with 3 screws. We haven't installed it yet, but it looks like it will be easy to install. I will try to update my review if I run into any problems with it.

"If you're looking for a reasonably priced calf sleeve, with quality compression, you won't go wrong with this product.

To be honest, I was skeptical about the lack of siding options, but they were right, the sleeves fit perfectly. It gave the right amount of compression for me, that it aided my shin splint pains during my runs.  My calves are about 15 inches around, and I stand 5 ft 11in.  It was easy to get on and off too.

I have to say I also appreciated the humor in their shipping email. If you're active in Amazon, you get these often, but as you see in the screenshot, this one was different. I actually laughed out loud while reading and had to share it with my wife. She agreed that it was a nice, humorous touch to a typically boring part of the process.

Basically, if you're looking for calf compression, especially to help with shin splints, you won't go wrong with this product.

Pros:
Fit
Quality
Easy on and off

Cons:
None yet - perhaps a thinner calf would see less compression?

"This thing actually works! One major criteria that wasn't mentioned is that you must have rhythm in order to get it to work. My hubs is a very gifted musician and he had another friend that was talented too. They both sawed off a huge branch seamlessly. The next day, he had another buddy help and they couldn't make the saw work. This friend has zero rhythm. They got nowhere fast. My hubs enlisted my help (I too am musically gifted) and we sawed another huge branch without any problems. Hope this helps!",0
The cushioned socks I received  felt really good and comfortable. They look like regular socks but when you put them on you can feel the difference. I wore them all day and it kept my feet dry and rested. I purchased the medium size socks which fits well for a size 8 1/2 to 9 in shoe size. The only concerns I have is that some of the seams looks questionable and it shows wear right away. I will update my review in the future on how well these socks have held up.

We got this lovely butterfly necklace for my daughter, who graduates from high school this year, where her high school colors are blue and white (as is her future university). I like how the silver chain and bejeweled frame sparkle, drawing attention to the blue crystal within, which is really something. I've never seen anything like this cut before. It is sort of like an inverted solitaire cut, sort of like a heart shaped stone, but with four clefts instead of the one. It's brilliant and beautiful and I just love the look of the butterfly!",1

"Thank goodness for this AMAZING product! I live in a small apartment with no dishwasher and I'm constantly struggling to have enough room on my tiny dish rack. I'm a sucker for anything that helps me feel more ORGANIZED and this product does just that.

First off, I love the DOUBLE rack. On the bottom, you can store large pans, bowls, etc. On the top, you can have up to 8 large dinner plates. One end of the rack has space for 6 cups/mugs and the other has a double-compartment for silverware.

When I got this product, it was not fully assembled. However, set up was EASY. It took me about 10 minutes and I just followed the picture on the outside of the box. VERY SIMPLE.

Overall, I'm very HAPPY with this purchase and highly recommend. I give this product 5 stars for it's aesthetics, durability and functionality.

"gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous!!!!!  Soft and comfortable material.  Excellent quality!  I used this for a night out, and wish I had taken a picture.  It's not too heavy that it'll make your neck overheat, but it's not extremely thin that it's just a piece of material hanging on your neck doing nothing.  It sits nicely around your neck and long enough to try a few different styles for scarves.  It's not a scratchy material either so sensitive skin could possibly use this without much worry.

"I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion. I purchased this ring for my husband. He recently gave me a platinum ring. I wanted to get him something nice, but really can't afford too. This seamed like a nice jester. It look like a quality ring. Heavy. He does not wear his wedding band do to he is always moving heavy items.
Here are some great facts about the ring
 - 8mm comfort fit
- Made of jewelry grade tungsten
- Beveled edges and brushed metal for a modern finish
- Cobalt free and hypoallergenic - won't cause skin irritations or discolor skin
- Scratch resistant and durable
- Will retain its shine over the years
- Can be engraved with a laser engraving tool
- Available in sizes 8-12.5
- Lifetime warranty! If your ring doesn't fit or you aren't 100% satisfied we will take your ring back no questions asked.
Easily cleaned up in soap and water. He will love this ring and I din't have to pay an arm and a leg. Thank you",1

"This set of shakers is very cute.  The size is appropriate for salt and pepper shakers for the table.  I collect pigs and love that they are in the shape of pigs because they match my many other pigs.
Pros:
Good size
The Pigs wink and that's cute
I believe there ceramic, so very easy to wash
Silicone nose piece makes filling up easy
Pigs have feet to help them sit flat on surfaces
Pink is salt and blue is pepper, the color difference means no confusion
Good holding capacity, you can put more inside that you think just by looking at it.
Cons:
I prefer a few more holes, the pepper shaker has tiny holes so unless you use fine ground pepper the flakes are to big to come out.
The salt shaker holes are adequate.
Upon arrival one of my silicone nose pieces was damaged.  I was able to glue it back together and it does not interfere with the actual use of the shakers. The seller is currently sending me a new nose piece.
Overall I like these shakers, there a nice addition to my collection and there very cute.  The pigs wink at each other and it's adorable.  These are my only winking pigs.  I think this item would make a great gift for newly weds or a cool novelty item for a collector such as myself.  I'm not in love with the way the salt and pepper sprinkles but they are a  very cute collection addition. Mine look perfect displayed with my other pig items. These shakers appear to be heavy and capable of normal use without fear of breaking.  So far mine are holding up well.  If your a collector of anything pig or perhaps looking for a cute little gift item then I would recommend this product to you.",0

"This mini selfie beauty light is everything I didn't know I needed! It's compact & lightweight which makes it easy to keep in your purse. I was iffy about whether or not the light would be flattering or if it would look terrible. I can happily say it's perfect selfie lighting. You can also use it to take photos with your regular camera on the iPhone, if for some reason you need it. It's easy to attach & seems to stay on securely. Rechargeable via USB, which is an added bonus.

I've included one photo without the light & one with. Both were taken with my iPhone 6. One taken right after the other, without lighting changes aside from turning on the selfie light. I DID NOT use the front facing camera ""flash"" function available on snapchat for either of these photos.

"Any serious prepper or survivalist will tell you that knowledge is the key. You can have all the cool gear in the world but if you don't have basic knowledge your screwed.  With that said cool toys are still awesome to have!
Pro's
Strong & thick
Useful contents-
Needing to start a fire? Got you covered. Thing to scrape to gets sparks (magnesium cylinder scraper). Fluff to scrape sparks onto (tinder). Prior to starting a fire you have to scrape the black powdered coating off of the cylinder in oder to use the magnesium.  Two small fishing hooks with fishing line, weights, and floats. These won't get you a big mouthed bass. However,  they are better than nothing! This is where knowledge can make the difference. If you have knowledge you can use these items for multiple things-make a trap/snare for instance. Serrated edge is very sharp and can cut cords or cloth. I like how the ends of the cords are cut and glued, less likely to unravel or cause irritation. The instructions  (inside the brown cover) come in 7 languages and have a numbered drawing of the contents included.
Cons for me:
The very sharp serrated edge/knife scrapes your wrist. If you don't pay attention you will ""paper cut"" yourself/fingers with it. There is a lot of space between the cords on the underside-it's not tightly woven. Due to the large gaps/spacing you can see the contents on the inside. My 6 inch wrist are too small for this large bracelet and can be uncomfortable for me to wear. However, It's cool and neat to have so I wear it anyway. You never know when you may need to save the world...or zombie apocalypse or EMP.
Update: 07/07/16
The seller contacted me about the issue with the serrated edge cutting my wrist. They sent me a couple of the edge covers. Tried them and they worked awesome!  I showed another one of my co-workers the bracelet w/cover today. He asked to buy it from me! I recommend this for anyone looking at grown up toys / gear for a ""just in case"" situation.",0

"This frog lure is pretty accurate, looking at it while it is in my hand it really does resemble a real frog which is pretty impressive and once it gets in the water the little tassels on the back will mimic a similar motion to how a frogs legs look while swimming. I like that they come in a variety of colors just like you would see on frogs out in the wild. The hooks on these are pretty large which will help with bigger fish, although I do wish the frog itself was slightly thinner so the hooks stick out a little bit more to ensure the fish does indeed get hooked well.

I was provided this for free for my review.  I really like how well it works.  The minute it came in I tried it on an area rug in my hallway and it has done a great job holding it down.  I would get again as needed.,1
Aesthetically a good design. Wish it ground a little more easily and faster. It unlocks easily and spills the pepper. Would not recommend unless you plan on being very careful when you grind pepper.,0
"These glasses are actually pretty nice which is surprising for the price. i would say they aren't really good quality, but a nice pair to wear when you are worried about damage or losing them. My husband wears them when he plays baseball or golfs. He needs protection from the sun, but he doesn't want to wear his more expensive sunglasses and worry about losing or breaking them. So, we got these as an alternative so he wouldn't have to worry about it. He has a rather round head, and these fit him comfortably. If you have a smaller or narrow head, I don't think they would fit very well and would likely fall off. It is hard to find sunglasses that fit him and if they do, they typically don't fit ""normal"" people. The frames do feel a little ""light"", which usually equates to ""cheap"" or fragile. We hope that isn't the case! Speaking of cases, they come with a really nice hard case that zippers closed. They also come with a cleaning cloth. Overall, pretty good value, though nothing fancy they do seem to work very well!

"The fabric is nice and light weight, perfect for a summer sleeper. It has a roomier cut, which is great for me. I have a chunky baby and I use cloth diapers which means an extra fluffy butt. The zipper makes the sleeper easy to get on and off quickly. The top of the zipper is cover by extra fabric to keep from poking baby. Rubber monsters on the bottom of the feet make jumping easier for my little guy.
Overall baby approved!

"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NVIDIA-SHIELD-Tablet-intelliGLASS-HD-2014-2015-K1-The-Smarter-Glass-Screen-Protector-by-intelliARMOR-To-Guard-Against-Scratches-and-Drops-HD-Clear-With-Max-Touchscreen-Accuracy/dp/B00TD9G9R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NVIDIA SHIELD Tablet intelliGLASS HD (2014 & 2015 K1) - The Smarter Glass Screen Protector by intelliARMOR To Guard Against Scratches and Drops. HD Clear With Max Touchscreen Accuracy.</a>

I bought this when I bought the NVIDIA Shield tablet K1. I was pleasantly surprised because the packaging that it came in was VERY premium and well designed. I didn't expect that because, after all, this is just a screen protector.

You get several ""tools"" in the kit (and yes, this is a kit) for cleaning the screen:
1) A wet wipe
2) A microfibre cloth
3) A ""dust tape"" that's a little bit larger than the screen of the Shield tablet
4) A mini suction cup to aid you in positioning and placing the screen cover (which I ended up not using since I realized I could do better with just my hands and being extremely careful not to get dust on to the adhesive side of the cover)

It's a bit of an overkill just to ensure that there's no dust or oil or smudges on the screen before you apply the screen cover but I really didn't mind. They worked extremely well. Instructions were clear and concise except for the fact that the ""dust tape"" was not appropriately labeled so that took me about 2 minutes of figuring out what that was for.

The screen cover itself is as promised - it's very clear, it's reasonably thin, it does keep oily fingerprints away as promised (although it's not dust resistant), and most important of all - it doesn't take away from the screen sensitivity.

I loved the fact that despite having somewhat sweaty/oily fingers, the screen cover doesn't smudge and it makes swiping on the tablet screen a continually smooth and pleasant experience.

Why only 4 stars? The screen cover itself is about 0.5mm short on both length and width compared to the shield tablet screen (almost impossible to notice unless you're nitpicking). Also. the items in the kit could have been labeled so as to completely avoid any confusion with how to use them.

Overall though, this item is worth its price. Very highly recommended.",0
"I love these cases. I got it in both light blue and purple and they are both great. I had a case like this before, but switched it out to something else when it started to get worn out (I carry the device in my purse every day so my case gets a lot of wear and tear). I never liked the other cases as much as my old rotating one so I decided to switch back to this style and am very happy I did! I love that I can orient the case in landscape and portrait positions without removing the device from the case, and I love that there are deep grooves to prop the device up with. The case is a little thick, so it does add some bulk to my iPad, but It offers great protection so my iPad doesnt get banged up in my purse. Both cases fit perfectly on my iPad mini 3. It is easy to install, and my device stays in securely. All the buttons and ports are easily accessible, and the camera is unobstructed (as long as you have the iPad turned the right way. The rotation is smooth and easy to do. I need my cases to be auto sleep/wake since I always forget to put my device to sleep otherwise, and these cases have that feature. I like that there is an elastic strap to hold the case closed as well. There is also a loop for a stylus, which I don't use, but it would be handy for someone who likes to use a stylus. The cases seem very sturdy and I expect them to hold up well over time. I also think both colors I got are very attractive. The purple is my favorite, but the light blue is great too. Overall Im extremely happy with these cases. Im using the blue one now, but Im glad I have the purple as a backup when it wears out (or for when I feel like switching things up for fun, which will probably happen first). I can definitely recommend these!

The clips were to stiff to let the bullets go but the pouch is great even for holding loose rounds,0
I don't like the fact that I got a large and it is still kind of small in some areas like my legs and it's big up top but maybe that's just my body type I really don't like that you have to take off the whole thing when you go to the bathroom and it is very uncomfortable to get on and off.,0
"The leather this card sleeve is made from is really nice. It is the kind of leather that will just get better with age.  I could fit a lot of cards and it still maintained a slim profile.  It came packaged in a lovely gift box perfect for gift giving.  The front pocket where the tab is was the only on that was a little stiff but I think it will loosen up over time. I am  female, and think it would look nice carried by either a man or a woman.  I am really happy with my purchase.  It also would be good for carrying business cards and money.

"These are different from what I thought they were, but great just the same. I had assumed they were normal pencil sharpeners. They are, kind of. They are normal sharpeners inside a comically large facimile of a normal sharpener that doubles as a shavings holder. Work great, and I'll never have to buy another with how many there were.

Love these sneakers!  I buy ASICS because they've made my heel pain go away completely.  This pair is great for cold weather - I wore them through a cold New England winter and they always kept my feet dry.  I'm an avid walker and they've held up well with lots of use.,0
"It looks nice. Says it comes with the pins. The package was damaged and the pins were gone. It shows the frame with it, but it is not included. Had I known this I would not have bought it.

"I cannot wait till cool weather to wear these button boot socks with my tall boots!  They are excellently detailed with lace and the buttons.

I can't believe it was that easy to replace. I am not an electrician and it took me less than 30 mins to replace 2 fixtures. Each one of the bulbs has one row of LEDs. Other more expensive bulbs may have 2 rows of LEDs if you need more brightness. Make sure to turn off all power and wear insulated gloves.,0
"I got this recently and I am absolutely thrilled that the front tempered glass screen covers the entire front. I have been so unhappy with the many many screen protectors that do not cover the whole thing, but leave a gap around the edge. It comes with one for the back too. For some reason I was expecting an actual case, and was kind of disappointed when I got it, but so far I am liking it. It has a little bumper thing that protects the sides of the phone which is pretty nice, so it almost feels like it does have a case on it. The tempered glass on the back almost leaves the phone kind of slick, so be careful with it. Unless you have insurance on it.

These are nice pair of dress pants. I found the sizing to be accurate and they fit well. The reason I do not give it 5 stars is the material does not look as nice as comparable pants. These reminded me of more of a pair of work pants as opposed to dress pants. I golf a lot and I would not wear these to the course. I also do not think they are dressy enough to wear with a dress shirt and tie. That being said it might just be my style and that I had different expectations of these pants.  I would have given it 5 stars if they were priced lower but at nearly $30 I would rather have a pair of dockers. I did receive these pants in exchange for an honest review.,1

"Great wireless charger from LDesign.  I have a charger case for my iphone 5s and all I do is lay the phone on the charger and it starts to charge.  It is usually done within a few hours.  The design is great and it is a well made sturdy product.  I have been using it for  weeks now and have not had one problem with it.  I have also tried it with our galaxy phones and also no problems.  You just plug it into the USB charger and its ready to go.  It has 4 little plastic feet at the bottom,if you take the little plastic stickers off it will also keep it from sliding.  The charger and my phone does not get hot during charge.  I recommend this cool looking little charger.

"Let me just start off by saying I love whiskey stones. These particular whiskey stones are a little smaller and slightly different than others I've had and used. However, I'm a huge fan of that. They fit in the glasses a little easier. I was in need of new whiskey stones when I sought these out. They chill well in the freezer and keep my drinks cool. Personally, I don't only use them for whiskey, but for just about every type of drink I have.

I like that these not only come with the velvet bag to keep them together in the freezer, but also a set of tongs to add the stones to your drink. The bag it comes with is well constructed and helps keep your stones together. This is a beautiful set that works well if you're getting it for yourself or makes an amazing gift for anyone in your life.

I've had a set of whiskey stones in the past destroyed when someone in the house put them in the dishwasher. They just didn't seem the same afterward. Make sure you clean them according to the instructions - they only need to be rinsed in water. I would highly suggest against putting them in the dishwasher. I've never felt the need to do that with any whiskey stones.

Overall, these are great whiskey stones, and some of the better ones I've gotten over the years. I look forward to continual use of these, as they make having drinks of any kind better. Chill your drink and don't worry about watering it down when you use the 12 Premium Granite Whiskey Stones - Chill Without Diluting Flavour or Aroma - Reusable Ice Cubes - Safe Hygienic - 14 Pce Gift Box Set with 12 Stones Velvet Pouch and Tongs.

"I really like this shirt. It hangs  beautifully. It is very pretty and would probably go as well with dress pants as it does with jeans.  Even living in the hot and humid South, it is not too hot. I say this because I worried at first about the material. Does not easily wrinkle.",0
"I got these for my mother because she collects chopsticks! She has a bunch of different ones from different places and of different colors and shapes. But she doesn't have any metal ones as far as I know. She will soon be visiting me and I will give these to her as a gift.
I think they make a great gift because they come in a nice storage case, they are metal so will last long and nothing will happen to them. They seem like they will hold the food well because of the little dents on the ends so that the food doesn't slip. They also have a signature dents on the other end which I think is a nice touch that makes the chopsticks look fancy (just my own opinion).
While my mother collects chopsticks, she doesn't just store them, she actually uses them instead of spoons or forks a lot of the time. She just likes eating with chopsticks. She says it allows her to eat less and to concentrate on her meal more and be more mindful about what and how much she eats. I don't know if that would be true for me, but I am glad it is working for her. I think she will be pleased with these as a gift.

"I have several salt lamps in my home. I needed a small one for my husband's bedside table. He is a restless sleeper most nights. I thought this lamp might help him relax a little. We've had it for a little over a week now. He is definitely sleeping better. Salt Lamps are known to purify the air by cleansing and deodorizing but they also neutralize electromagnetic radiation from appliances such as TV's, computers, cell phones, and radios. They can help people that suffer from asthma and allergies and increase energy levels. The rock that is included is natural Himalayan crystal salt rock mined in the Himalayan mountains so the variety of rock pieces are unique to each purchase. This set came with the rock separated so you get to experience putting your salt lamp together on your own. I enjoyed piecing together my salt lamp and love the ambiance that it provides for my home. We have lots of electronic devices in our home so I feel this product will be a great way to reduce the static and radiation you get when using these types of devices in your home. It has helped my husband tremendously! It is quite beautiful when all the rocks are in and the light is turned on. It also has a dial on the cord so you can adjust the lighting if it's too bright. The lamp came very well packaged in Styrofoam. 3 bulbs cam with it, which was nice. Shipping was super fast. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and would buy again.

"**This review is for the Set of 2 CaliTime Pillow Cover Cotton Canvas Colorful Vintage Floral Embroidered 18 X 18 Inches by CaliTime**

I love throw pillows and sometimes you want to switch them out, this throw pillow covers are perfect for that. 2 pillow covers are the set and they are beautiful. I got these in the color teal and they are beautiful.

The covers are 18""x18"" which is a good size and pretty much a normal size for a throw pillow. They have a design on and they are made out of 100% Cotton Canvas. It has a zipper that zips really nicely and you can tell it is hand sewn but very nicely. The stitching is good quality and I haven't had any issues with the string coming out or unraveling.

These pillows really give my bedroom a special look and touch. I think this is really good quality and I completely recommend them.

"This iPhone 6 Case from UrSpeedtekLive is awesome on the outside. It is a gorgeous vibrant purple. It is synthetic leather which helps prevent scratches and chips to the case. It opens and closes with a magnetic closure that makes it simple. The inside has built in credit card holders and id slots that make it simple to carry everything you need in this small case. The snap in case that you snap your phone into however was very difficult. I took many tries to get my phone in and I did not feel comfortable leaving it in there as the side seem to not fit great around the edge. With it not fitting properly I do not use the case because I do not want it to come out and get broken.

I never use these type of folding cases because it is just too much trouble trying to get your phone and fold the case back and keep it folded.  This was no different but I expected that. It's a really really nice case. The quality of the material is very nice! The colors are very vibrant and prominent. I love the blue on this case and I also like the fact that it closes with the little magnetic thing. I wore this on my phone for a few days to test it out and see how much I like it and I do like it so I'll probably wear it on my phone every once in a while.

"The silicone ice cube trays are just wonderful.  I have been meaning to get them for some time.  So when I had the chance to get them, I jumped at it right away.  These sure beat the traditional ice trays that make little ice cubes.  These cubes make any drink unique. The large square ones are mainly used for adult drinks in the house.  The kids use the circle ones.  My son had a great idea of putting Popsicle sticks into the opening for the circle ones and putting in different favor juices into it.  Thought that was brilliant.  The trays themselves are made from soft silicone.  They bend and mold easily to remove the cubes. They are machine washable.  When we got the trays there was a bit of a smell but it is recommend to wash the trays before first use anyways.  Overall, we are very happy with the ice trays and would highly recommend them to anyone.

A very nice way to add storage to my laptop.  Very unobtrusive.,0
I purchased an earlier version that would not pair properly. The company provided me with this model as an upgrade for free. It works perfectly. Now it is not intended for Hi Def audio but pairs nicely with my Bluetooth ear buds and plugs into my AV sound system so that I can watch tv (I tend to like action shows where volume fluctuates) while my wife is sleeping in the next room. Very cot effective solution for a touchy problem. Thanks guys,1
"The hardest part of owning this camera is setting it up. It took me a few tries to hook it to my router before it worked. The wifi connection went similarly, but once I got the wifi established- and the description in the manual is a little unclear- it is capable of being connected to your wifi and being able to function without being connected to your router. Basically to set it up you have to pull the metal hood/top off (you may have to pry up on the sides in order to slide the top off) and find the sticker with your camera's info and password. The next step is to plug in the camera and plug it into your router. Download the Sricam app from your appstore (I found it on GooglePlay without an issue). You create a login by entering a valid email and password for the app. You can choose to add a camera and you can enter the information you find on the sticker. If the camera is not connected to the internet you can keep holding down the reset button located on the cord until the camera shows up on the app. This step was a bit irritating to me because I had to do it a couple of times before it worked. After you are connected you should be able to see the video from the camera on your app.  You can set the wifi up from the app and you'll need your wifi's info and password to connect. This step took me a few tries to get too, but it eventually connected to my home wifi. The camera can be moved anywhere the wifi signal can be reached. the camera comes with a mount so it can be mounted indoors or outdoors with the included mounting bracket and hardware. There is no SD slot on the camera, unfortunately. The camera is extremely durable and well made and definitely feels like it can handle the outdoors. It is metal and waterproof. There is the metal hood over the top of the camera to help protect it from the rain and snow. The camera is incredible quality and can be viewed in pretty high resolution for a security camera. The camera is able to be zoomed in and out using the pinch and expand method on the smartphone app. The night vision is also amazing quality and it can be viewed in greyscale/black and white format. The downside to night vision is that it is clear that the camera is on because as soon as you view the camera from the app red lights illuminate and it's clear that the camera is on and you are watching (a downside if you wanted to be subtle). I can save still-shot pictures on my phone, which is really nice. I cannot save video, but you have the option of recording if you are using a computer to view the camera. The camera has a running time log so you know exactly when the pictures are from, and while you are viewing you know that it's a live view. The lag on this camera isn't too bad, it's just a couple of seconds behind. I really like that I can keep an eye on my home if I'm not there. I have used the alarm setting where it makes your phone ding if it detects movement and this feature definitely worked really well. I really find comfort in this camera, and that's what matters. As long as you get through the set up, it's a great camera! I even used it as a make-shift baby monitor and I had no issues. Wonderful camera and I'm happy to have the peace of mind that this camera brings!

This is the second time I bought these scrubs I love them. As a female size 12-14 tall I find the unisex scrubs are alway more comfortable. These fit perfect with room to actually work a long shift comfortably. I phone pocket and cargo pocket work great.,0
"I've been looking for a good pair of workout gloves. Solid fingerless gloves make your hands sweat, so I thought I'd try these. This is a review for Training Gloves with wrist support and silicone padding for men and women, perfect for WOD training, crosstraining, fitness training, weightlifting, powerlifting, gym training by VOLTFORM.

I like these, but they have some cons. The quality is real good, and they seem like they'd last a while. The material is comfortable, and soft. The padding isn't too thick, but just the right amount to protect your hands.

I purchased the large. I am a female, but I have wide hands. The fingers are a bit tight, and they seem long. When I say long, I mean when the fingers & wrist are in the correct place, the palm part bubbles out. That's pretty uncomfortable & kind of annoying. Maybe that's just how they are supposed to fit. But honestly, I don't like it. The grip on the palm is excellent for a bar. The non-slip surface has a pretty good grip. These definitely help you keep your grip on a chinup/pullup bar or heavy barbell.

The openness of the glove keeps your hands from sweating, which is my favorite thing about these gloves. These also would not only keep your hands from sweating & the bar slipping, the padding would keep your hands from getting sore, red & callused from a barbell spinning. The wrist support has an elastic collar & is adjustable with velcro. It's a good support & I like it.

Overall, these are good partial grip gloves, but with the few things about them that I just don't like, I'm not sure I'd totally recommend them.

If you have few lights around the house that eat up power,you will see that reflected on your monthly bill. To have the same light output and save money at the same time,sounds like a deal maker to me!!

The Retro Bulbs:
-------------------------
The word retro derives from the Latin prefix retro, meaning backwards, or in past times in other words, Retro style is an outdated style or fashion that has become fashionable again. These light bulbs do have that distinguished look of the forties,fifties and became popular with the females in my household! Also that makes me happy to please them while saving on the electric bill :)
The bulbs are a bit larger than your standard Candelabra lights! If you have a small light fixture make sure they fit! They measure exactly 5 inches from base to tip! Width is the same as the other ones.

Lights,Bulb,Action:
----------------------------
Looking at the specs of these bulbs makes you wanna buy more! At 1.8W vs 25W with the same amount of light! If you do the math,it means you can have exactly 13.8 of these bulbs to consume as much as one of the standard 25W bulb!! How about that for saving!! This is why I got these as a complementary sample in the first place! According to listing,they can burn for 25000 hours. In other words,if you let them run for 24 hrs a day,they will last for about three years.

Conclusion:
-----------------
Get these lights and I promise you'll never regret it! They are of a decent quality and look really elegant in any light fixture. Still, if you're a skeptical person and not sure whether to trust other people's reviews or not! With Amazon's 30 day return policy, you have four weeks to try it out yourself, before returning it for any reason, with no questions asked, and in most cases Amazon will pay for the return shipping, in other words, it is a win, win situation!! With that said, I hope you find my humble opinion helpful in making or breaking your buying decision,",1

The 2 most important things to look for in headphones are how they sound and how they fit. Without both, you want enjoy, or use them very often. These phones sound excellent! I'm a retired professional trumpet player, studio musician and I do know quality sound when I hear it. With these phones you actually get two different E.Q. settings. LOTS OF BASS, without the noise cancellation but when you turn on the noise cancellation, the volume goes up as well as the higher frequencies, so you can adjust the sound to your taste in music.
As for comfort, these are the most comfortable headphones I've tried on and you could easily wear them all day. They have found that happy medium where they don't fall off your head, when you lean over, but aren't so tight that they give you a headache.
In the under $100 price range these will be very hard to beat. Try them and I believe you'll agree. Product received for professional evaluation.",1

I love this blanket. I have been doing some early Christmas shopping. I know that everyone can always use a blanket. I am so impressed with the material of this.

"This dress is really cute. The fabric is nice and stretchy, with a ripple-y texture. I wear 16/18 and ordered the 3x. It fit fine. For those who may be familiar with the brand, it's Ambiance Apparel. They sell this at some of my local stores, so it might give you an idea on how it fits. The craftsmanship seems well, not like it will fall apart right away. My only complaint on this dress is that it's too short. I am 5'7 and I feel like this dress MAYBE covers and inch or two past my butt. It's definitely cute to wear with leggings though.

Well, it seemed like literally minutes when I received a response explaining what was likely the issue and that if my address was correct and I wanted the offered solution of a replacement, they would send me one asap.

"In receiving this, I was very impressed with how sturdily the towel and bag are made.  The stitching on both seems very durable.  I love how long this towel is.  The bags material is also very thick.

It's provides a great hygienic layer to place over my exercise mat; it offers a very good grip. The fabric is strong and it washes and dries beautifully. Having done a little research on how to best clean Microfiber, I prefer to wash it by hand due to other liquids in a load of laundry such as fabric softener,  would diminish its gripping action and absorbing power; it would grossly attract lint from other fabrics in the wash and/or dryer; and to discourage and avoid any possibility of it retaining a, sporty-sweaty smell.  One thing that Ive learned with Microfiber is to keep the air spaces open and avoid anything that could cause the fibers to get bunched up.

I also think this towel is also great to take along with when I go to the beach. Its long enough for me to stretch out on the sand to sun bathe.

I do have my favorite gym/workout bag that I prefer and I think that this bag is a great take along for grocery shopping or other activities to.  Its compact when folded and can carry quite a few things.  Ive also loaded it down with a few heavy items and the bag is sturdy enough to withstand the pressure.  Its very hard to find reusable bags for grocery shopping and Im glad to add this to my growing collection of sturdy, well made reusable bags for shopping.

The watch seems to be decent quality. My son wanted the green one and we were a bit disappointed that the green was not a bright green like in the pictures. It is actually much darker. Almost a mix between forrest green and army green.,0
"I was pleasantly surprised by these! They're exactly as pictured.
Set comes with ten wooden hangers with clips.
I ordered the dark walnut, I was worried the wood wouldn't look as quality as it does in the picture. They're a beautiful dark walnut color and the wood looks and feels quality. I tested these on multiple garments and the clips function great, didn't have any issues with their functionality.
I feel like these are good quality and will last a long time.
These would be great for personal use or for in a business setting.

"This is, without a doubt, one of the most delicious-smelling body butters I have ever bought.  The Moisturizing Body Butter Cream, 8 ounces, Coconut Lime Verbena by Truly Divine Body Care is rich and creamy, and leaves my skin silky and hydrated.  The coconut lime scent is yummy without smelling like suntan lotion--just a nice, fresh, soft scent that lasts.  It's smoothed even my roughest problem areas, such as elbows, knees, and heels.  This is going to be my new go-to after-shower treat.

The folks at Truly Divine Body Care have made this body butter with a LOT of natural, good for you ingredients.  Some of the listed ingredients are safflower seed oil, hemp seed oil, argan kernel oil, shea butter, aloe vera, jojoba seed oil, and extracts of horsetail, cucumber, rosehips, pomegranate,and lemongrass.  It's cruelty-free, sulfate-free, gluten-free, and vegan, and is made in the USA.  It's definitely a luxury product.

I received a discount on the body butter in return for my honest and unbiased review.  I love this stuff, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes delicious bath and body products.",1
"I received this case at a reduced price, for a fair and unbiased review.
I was looking for a minimalist case that would show off the great look of my phone and this fit the bill. The material of the case has not clouded or discolored in any way during the last six months worth of use - I can see through it as clearly as the day I bought it. It is tactile enough to keep the phone from slipping out of my hand like it is prone to do without a case and while holding the glass back. It hasn't been marred or scratched from my daily use, as advertised, and the case itself generally still looks new after six months.",1

"These pants are very nice material and comfy. They are great quality and a t a good price. I usually wear a size large, but after reading the reviews I decided to get a size bigger and they fit nice. They are nice to hang around the house in and not so thick that you get hot.

"I like this lightweight cardigan for summer nights in Arizona.  The fabric breathes and is not heavy at all. I especially like the styling.  This is a new look for cardigans and I like the side slits.  The length covers all the parts you want to cover and the slits give a sexy look when they fly open.  This looks especially good with shorts.  I have worn this cardigan with sleeveless dresses out on dates and also with shorts and jeans.  It looks good with everything.  I ended up ordering a size larger than I normally would because this was the only size available.  The top/shoulders were a little big, so I sprayed water on the top and dryed it on medium.  This solved the problem with the size.  I will not be drying this cardigan in the future.  I washed the cardigan on gentle in the washing machine and hung to dry and it came out looking great.  I was offered this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I am also a buyer and read other reviews before purchasing items. This is my honest review of the cardigan.",1

"This meat thermometer so far seems to be of nice quality. I love that the package it comes in tells you the temperatures that your meat should be for it to be cooked either rare, medium rare, medium, or well done, these readings are also on the meat thermometer. The back of the package also gives you super easy instructions on how to use the meat thermometer. To use it you just press the on button, and mine was reading in Celsius. So all I had to do was push the  button right below the on/off button and it switched over to fahrenheit. After that you just put the probe into the thickest part of the meat and press the hold button before pulling it out. Pushing hold will make the temperature stay on the screen rather than instantly dropping once you pull it out of your meat. It should then have your reading on the screen. The numbers on the screen are pretty large, which should make it easy to read. You can then either push the on/off button again to turn it off, or it will automatically turn off after 10 minutes to conserve the battery life. Ther reading seems to be pretty accurate, however I don't have another meat thermometer to compare it to so I can't be 100% positive. The probe on the meat thermometer will also fold up so it won't be dangerously sticking out in a kitchen drawer. Another thing I loved about this is that the 1 AAA battery needed to operate the meat thermometer was included and already in the device. It was priced at $12.99 when I purchased it and I think that it a fair price, depending on how much you cook.

Easy to pick up due to the tapered edges.
Nice liquid catching groove unlike the old one that was ALWAYS such a mess
Has a hole to grip or hang it with, also unlike the older one.
No plastic or metal to rust or break off and as seen the other is several pieces while this one lists as being made without any glue.

The glue reference confuses me because looking at it from the side it REALLY REALLY looks like several pieces are attached. If they aren't using glue I don't know what they used but I hope it lasts a long time. I really like this cutting board.

Nice information on care and such provided on the sleeve that came around the board, taking a slightly different approach but glad it was provided.

"I've got a standard shower curtain spring-rod and these just barely ""Snap"" on. I like that they're slightly snug (and because they're wire, you could probably afford a few millimeters of bend by hand) for an even more secure fit. Nothing worse than whipping open the shower curtain for the o'le mornin' helicopter and having the curtain jump the rails ruining the show.",0
"i like how it fits up top and the sleeve length is spot on, however it is a little tight around the midsection area. if you have the body shape as the person in the description picture it will fit fine, but I do not have that body shape. im a little rounder. perhaps the makers of this great shirt could Frankenstein a 2xl with a xl?

"It's a very heavy duty case which I need. I am pretty rough on my phone, an keep it on by belt at all times.

"This is the sharpest kitchen knife I have ever had my hands on. I hope I don't hurt myself. A very, very nice blade, surprisingly light in overall weight and incredibly well balanced in my opinion. The nicest kitchen/chef knife I've had in the past was a gift from my son purchased from a Pampered Chef rep and it's been a good one, but I must admit this is the first true premium chef knife I have owned and I can honestly say I did not know what I was missing. If I don't cut myself, I expect we will have a long and very enjoyable relationship.

I'm not counting these minor critiques against my review, but I do wish the knife had it's own sheath; it fits well in my wooden knife block, so no harm-no foul. I'm  kinda unsure of whether I like the steel, hollow core handle. It looks high-tech and all, but it seems there is still something missing... no, really. It might just be an aesthetic thing, but hopefully it will grow on me. Regardless, of these minor nits, I really like the knife. Did I mention this thing is beyond razor sharp?",0
"These Twin Liner highlighter markers are a lot of fun. They work very well and the colors are bright and vivid. Each marker has one end that is yellow and the opposite end on each marker is a different color. You receive one that is purple, one that is pink, one that is orange, one that is green, one that is blue and one that is sort of salmon color. The caps on the markers fit very snug and won't be falling off all the time. They come in a plastic pouch that snaps closed. I really like these highlighters a lot and most likely I will be purchasing more. I've never seen any highlighters like this before and I like that they are very unique. I'm excited to start using them on things.

"**This review is for the Menton Ezil 3 Pairs Vintage Wood Grain Thick Frame Gradient Lens Wayfarer Cat Eye Sunglasses**

Cat eye sunglasses are so much fun and look great on most people, but cat eye sunglasses that are wood framed is so unique and they really look great.  There is 3 pair in this set as stated in the description and they look just like the pictures show.

Even though they are wood grain designed the frames are actually plastic but a very good quality plastic.  They seem to be very durable and I love that they are lightweight.  They almost make you forget that you are even wearing them.

The colors that you get in this set are pink, brown and gray'.  The lenses are nice and block the sun nicely. I like the style of the glasses they aren't too big but they are big enough for the cat eye effect.

I love this set a lot more than I thought I would like a wood grain design for sunglasses.

"Great quality product, but it runs rather large..",0
I love this product.  You can't beat if for the price!  I find that it is quite accurate and have used it several times to produce some excellent results in my cooking.  Just the other day I used it with a large Boston butt that I smoked in my smoker for 16 hours.  This product helped me gauge the temp of the meat over the 16 hrs in order to get the best results.  The result was some of the best pulled pork that I have ever made and tasted in my life!,0

"This is SO cute! I love this on my dog. It fit very comfortably around his neck. I could tighten or loosen the band very easily, and he doesn't get irritated by its presence around his collar. The colors are super vibrant and the product is really visible. The only thing I would change is that I wish it was an actual dog collar where I could clip on his leash and or tags. Over all it is super precious and I think my pup looks rather dashing in his bow tie.

"Remember that all dogs are different.. with that being said I found that this product works great on my Pomeranian and shih tzu. They tend to get very barky when company comes over with children. Normally we put them in their kennels to make sure they don't get hurt by wondering little kids, and to ensure there are no snips; but sometimes they continue to bark because they hear all of the commotion. We bought this in hopes that it would deter them from barking in the kennel, and it has definitely helps. Our pom tends to be barky on walks, so we have taken it a few times, but try to not make a constant out of it. I surely recommend this others.

"Good quality item. Slicer has good weight to it and easy to grip. After watching a video on how to use this slicer, we gave it a try. The video makes it look a lot easier than it is, but I'm really thinking practice makes perfect. One thing for sure, using this slicer is a much better option than the old fashion way of cutting up melon. Less mess, and less clean up. There was a bit more melon left behind in the shell than I expected, but I still think that with a little bit of practice, this will be remedied. I would definitely purchase this particular slicer again for myself and/or for a gift. If you are a kitchen gadget person, this is a must have...I don't think you will be disappointed.

"Because of the stretch fabric on this jean, I got a 16 size but it was too small at the waist- the fit everywhere else was good. I wear either a 16 or 18 in jeans depending on the fit. I should have ordered the size 18. I am in the process of trying to be healthier and lose weight so that is not entirely a bad thing. Unlike other stretch jeans the fabric is not thin and feels comfortable. This is a nice pair of jeans, though I would make sure you are ordering the correct size for you.

"I purchased these to organize and get more accessories in my tac. I opened them and I love them! They are way more durable than I thought they would be and I put quite a bit of abuse on them one night and every single one held up. The D ring is a little lightweight, yes, but for me it does the job.

These held quite a bit of weight for me, but I tend to err on the ""lighter"" side when it comes to my packs, but by no means are they ""light."" These did exactly what I wanted them to, and they are pretty easy on, easy off, and hold everything I need! VERY awesome set!!!

I ordered the Jstyle braided brown leather bracelet for my husband since he didn't have a brown bracelet. I was pleasantly surprised at the superior quality of this bracelet considering the moderate price I purchased it for. Very well made this bracelet is 8.5 inches long and has a bit of a vintage look to it. The silver coloured  solid clasp is magnetic and is solidly made. Apparently the clasp is hypoallergenic. Also lead and nickel free. Very easy to put on and remove using just one hand. No worries about the clasp coming undone and accidentally losing  it with this secure mechanism. I think this bracelet is more appropriate for men than women because of the size. Very nice and expensive looking bracelet. Would certainly consider purchasing this bracelet for gifting. Comes in a nice cloth pouch for storing. I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.,1
"I love this case.. when I pulled it out I thought it was a little big and bulky the ones putting it on my device and knowing that it was protected especially at the price of the device I feel very secure and it actually helps me hold the tablet better.

"My daughters love them for the convenience of getting in and out of them and for the lights.

"My family and I absolutely love to go camping every year we buy more things to add to our camping supplies. Last year the purchase an air mattress for the first time to sleep on and it was Heaven. The only problem was it didn't come with a pump. We had to borrow one of our neighbor and he use batteries because it was not electric which was really a pain in the butt. So I've been looking for a pump to purchase of Our Own and I found this one. It had really good reviews so I bought it. I could not be happier with this pump. It plugs into an outlet no batteries needed. It is really strong and our air mattress was blown up in seconds. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone who needs an air pump because I've used many different kinds before and they usually take a really long time especially when you have to use batteries. This one is really strong and it's lightweight unlike others.

"This is by FAR one of the best shirts I have purchased from Amazon. First of all, it fit JUST how I expected it to. It's a beautiful shirt that is very flowy and perfect for summer. I also love the versatility. I can wear it as part of a business or dress ensemble, but it will also be great as a casual shirt.

I ordered the blue and the color is GORGEOUS. I am also on the bigger side, but this shirt, while loose, doesn't make me look bigger. As a matter of fact, I think it makes me look thinner.

I ADORE this shirt and am SO happy I got it.

"I have been looking for a good pair of flat boots for a while and since I have been disappointed in the past with purchasing shoes on Amazon I was leery about this purchase, but based upon other reviews I finally decided on these boots. When I first opened the package and tried them on I was slightly disappointed in the style because they looked a little like work boots and my foot look big. However, when I tried these boots on with a pair of jeggings I was VERY satisfied. Paired with casual jeans, these boots look great. I normally wear a size 8.5 to 9, so based upon other reviews I decided on the 9 since I planned on wearing these in winter and with regular socks. I can see why the other reviews suggested going at least a half size up, as these boots are a little narrow across the top of the foot. I had a bunion removed from one of my feet about 6 months ago and the foot that still has the bunion was a little tight at first so I thought I would have to return these. After about an hour of wearing them my feet seemed to contour to the boot because they became very comfortable. I was able to wear these boots all day, both at work, where I am up and down a lot, and after work walking around the store and uneven ground. I think these will be my new ""go-to"" boot. Very good quality, the buckles were even wrapped up when I took them out of the package so they wouldn't scratch the material in shipping. Very satisfied with this purchase and even debating on the same boot in a different color.",0
Solid box!,0
"The product itself is good, and the length is fine.  The width is a bit narrow and initially caused an ache in my feet just after the toes.  I loosened the shoe laces and since it's a month long rec league I figured that would be okay.  After two games I think they're okay.  Probably great for people who have less thick feet than I do.  I don't tend to wear wide shoes but if you have any doubts I'd shy away from these cleats.",0
"I was very impressed with this costume for the price. The pants are like thin dress slacks, no elastic waistband. The padded wraps are very nice and the material laid very well. My husband said the inner tunic was itchy but he wore an undershirt and he was fine. I agree with other reviews, the actual belt was too large, we added some industrial Velcro and it worked fine. We were even part of the costume contest at the event! I thought it was a great costume!",0

"I am going to begin this review by stating that I am not, in any form or fashion an expert on Bluetooth devises, or even earbuds. This is the first set of Bluetooth earbuds/headphones I've owned. I expected the pairing process to be difficult, but instructions were included that were amazingly simple to follow. After charging the earbuds, I had them paired with my cellphone in less than a minute. I've never seen instructions that were so user-friendly.

In addition to the great instructions, these headphones came with a handy zippered carrying case, a USB cable for charging, and eartips in three sizes (S,M,L) certain to fit pretty much everyone.

The battery life has been much longer than I expected, too. I don't talk on my phone all that much, but I do like to stream music. The sound quality has been quite nice, with voice quality on calls clear. I have hearing problems, so I was concerned I wouldn't be able to hear voices clearly on calls, but this turned out to be a needless worry.

Overall, I've been very pleased with these earbuds. I would definitely recommend them to others.

I am using the medium size toiletry bag.  I had recently bought this type of item at a local retail store and my husband saw it so I was on the lookout for this type of item.  I am very impressed with how this item is functional.  It is so light and folds down to a small size when not in use.  It is a nylon fabric which is easy to wipe down and clean.  The top hook folds down and then extends to hook wherever you choose to use it.  I like that the hook rotates 360 degree so you can attach this anywhere you chose to.  It is very hand to have two outside independently zippered pockets.  Great for an electric razor or toothbrush.  There is a mesh pocket and elastic band to hold items with 3 separate spots for smaller items.  Like the elastic as things will not just fall out when you open the zipper. You have a pocket like this on both sides.  The bottom of the inside has a mesh zippered pocket which is not very thick.  It is dual purpose as it holds items into the bag but yet can hold smaller items.  I used it for jewelry.  This worked well.  The back has 3 pockets which are separated.  Great for bottles of hair product or deodorant.  The top has 2 zippered plastic pockets.  Really nice one snaps out.  This is nice for TSA security when you have to show them your liquids.  There is an outside carrying loop. I am not an Amazon company affiliate. I am an Amazon Prime customer that enjoys writing reviews as a hobby.

"This is A very cute pair of flip flops.  Not only are that cute,  but they are super comfortable.

I would suggest getting a little bigger of a size that you would normally wear...  I wear a 5.5 and got the 5 - 6 shoe size,  and my toes are hanging over...  It's very disappointing... I still wore around the house today hoping that they would stretch out a little.. I'm sad that that didn't because these suckers are super comfortable.. Lots of padding and you don't get that flip flop sound when you walk.

Luckily,  my daughter can wear these... If these were true to size,  I would give these five stars..  I'm sad that I can't wear these in public.

"Neat little product. Biggest pro is that it actually contains a way to make fire. With fire one can keep from freezing to death and sanitize water for drinking. Also since it has fishing supplies and the paracord which can be used for lashings for a shelter, and if the internal 7 strands are removed you end up with 7 times the original length, equipment for fishing or making animal snares ( the included blade can be used to clean fish or dress small game ) this tiny kit can cover all the bases. It's a good deal and will live attached to my pack. It's also tightly wrapped and not coming apart easily.  Trust me on this one, backcountry is my thing.

"I am a huge fan of kitchen gadgets. I have always believed that if it makes your life easier in the kitchen, hey, get it! One thing that I have always wanted is a potato ricer and masher. I love how I can use it for a variety of things, it's not just limited to potatoes. When I was given the opportunity to test this potato riser and masher out at a discounted price, I jumped at it.

When I first unboxed the potato ricer and masher, I noticed straight away that it has a very nice weight to it. It's not made out of some cheap flimsy material but I could tell that it was made out of some sturdy heavy duty stainless steel. It comes with 3 interchangeable plates and those are made out of stainless steel as well. I tried making some mash potatoes with it and I was pleasantly surprised that it was so easy to use. Just put in some boiled cut up potatoes in the cup and press. You do not even need to peel the potatoes. The masher separates the skin from the potatoes, so you will get nice fluffy potatoes in your bowl and the skin will remain in the cup of the masher. I am planning to use it again soon when I make pasta sauce with fresh tomatoes from my garden.

Overall, it's a nice, solid potato ricer and masher. It's really easy to use and it doesn't take a lot of strength to mash the potatoes. With that said, there is however room for improvement on the design. I just wished that the handles came with silicone or rubberized grips. It can get slippery sometimes, especially when your hands are wet. Also, it's not really that easy to clean. If only it came with some sort of brush to clean the little holes in the disc plates, then this potato riser would be perfect.

"I love this case. It hugs my new iPhone tightly <wink wink> to not let it slip out of its grips :) Seriously though, It is not one of those bulky cases which make the iPhone feel like a big brick. This case is true to the iPhone's form. The iPhone feels exactly like the iPhone even when it is in this case.

The buttons are nice. You do not need to press them hard to get the desired results. I have used some other cases of known brands. The buttons with those cases are too hard to use. I like the buttons on this case. I love the easy accessibility of the 'silent' button too.

There is rubber cushioning inside that doesn't scratch the phone. Another plus point for me.

I have owned this case only for a week now. So what I don't know yet is how protective the case is when the phone has a mighty fall. I pray I don't have to experience a fall of the phone just for the sake of a review, but if I do I will update this review with my findings.

The one thing I don't like though is the protection to the camera lens. It is barely there. Makes me worry.

"This is much more than a little lantern!

Dislikes
- low setting is still pretty bright

I thought this was just a nice little camping light. I need something for our popup camper for the times when the kids are asleep and Mom would like to read. This lamp may be a little too bright for that, even on the low setting. This is the problem I'm having with the bright light of all LEDs.

I love the size of this lantern. It fits in my hand and is a great size for portability. The clip at the top of the light is nice for hanging wherever you need it.

Along with this small latern, the box includes a user manual and charging cable. On one side of the light there is an ""input"" port and on the other side is an ""output"" port. Both are fitted with a silicone cover for dust and protection. Until I saw this I had no idea this was a portable power bank. That makes it even better for camping trips! How handy! The light charged quickly, but I haven't tested it as a powerbank yet.

The light has four modes: low, medium, high, and strobe. With the white LED light, even the low setting is pretty bright. I'm also not entirely sure what the function of the strobe light would be.

According to the description, this lantern is extremely durable. I'm not going to test dropping it, but I'm happy to know it can take a beating. The lantern is also waterproof, which is great if it gets left outside in the elements.

I'm so impressed with this little guy and can't wait to take it camping.

"I've never had a pair of lifting wrist wraps before, but I really enjoyed these pair. They definitely helped in reducing the pain I used to feel when bench pressing and shoulder pressing. I typically feel pain in wrists and they stay sore for a day or two after I workout my chest or shoulders. However, with these on I felt no pain at all during and after my workout. I was even able to lift slightly more weight than usual while wearing these. The only thing that I had trouble getting used to was the thumb grip. It's a little uncomfortable, but I'm sure it just takes some getting used it. The wraps themselves around my wrists felt great. They weren't too loose or tight. For any avid lifter, I would highly recommend these. I really enjoy doing close grip bench pressing, and with these on I had no pain and felt reassured that my wrists weren't going to snap as I increased the weight. Just as a bro tip. I wouldn't rely/wear them all the time. You don't want your body to depend on these. You still need to work on your grip/wrist strength without them. It's like the same concept of wearing a lifting belt. You don't want your body to need it all the time in order to work out your back or legs. Your lower back and core won't get stronger.

"Not true size I got the XL and it is no where near a XL, let me just say that it wouldn't even go up my thighs and I am curvy but not that curvy. The material felt like it would be uncomfortable to even wear and honestly I don't know about you but I would want to be comfortable.

For me (a perfectionist), it took me only two tries to install it on my phone.

"My 4 year old is autistic and VERY VERY VERY active!  He has a history of being super hard on socks and shoes.  For the first 3 years we bought him Vans because they were cute even with velcro (he doesn't ""do"" laces) but we were disappointed with how quickly they would fall apart.  We thought he was just a lot harder on shoes than the average kid.  While that's true, a shoe shouldn't come apart so badly.  I bought him his first pair of DC shoes when he grew into size 9, shortly before he turned 4.  While they seemed a little big on him width-wise at first, they turned out to be great!  Clearly more comfortable and easier to break in than the Vans and they held up amazingly well!!!  So well in fact that they are still fully intact even though he has now out grown them and needs size 10.  That's what I bought these for.  They are very similar to last pair I bought but are just a slightly different color scheme.  These are great shoes!  They're soft and well made, sturdy, have great soles and durable velcro straps.  Theses grey ones go with just about everything and look really cute!  My husband is a skater so he's thrilled with the shoe choice for little kids.

The only things I would list as ""cons"" for these shoes are that the velcro straps are too long.  This isn't really a big problem, but it seems unnecessary.  I would think their logic in making them that long would be to accommodate kids with bigger feet, but that leads right into my second ""con"" which is that these shoes are a LOT roomier inside than most other brands of kids shoes we've ever tried.  So roomy in fact that we have to velcro them as tight as they will go to keep them on snug, even though lengthwise the fit is good.  This is just a roomy shoe, so why all the extra velcro?  I promise, NO 4 year old has a foot THAT FAT to need that much room in the shoe AND that much additional velcro strap.

All that said, I really love these shoes and so does my son.  He can put them on and take them off by himself which is a big deal for us and he can do every kind of activity in them without seeming uncomfortable or tripping and falling because of them.  Well done DC!  Thank you for making a kids shoe that holds up to the abuse!  I know these are pricey, but for us they are worth it.  They are pretty much the only shoe our boy wears until he outgrows them.

"I love this planner so much! This planner has made my busy life so much easier!! I love the design, first off. The colors are beautiful! A FANTASTIC feature of this planner are the corners. There are metal corner covers; this is great because the corners are what always get messed up on my planners. I take my planner everywhere with me, so it's really nice that it has a gold ribbon to keep your place, as well as an elastic band to keep the planner closed.

I love that the days are split into hours. I normally run out of room in other planners because I'm writing times. The only issue is if there is something to do that is only one slot, there isn't much writing room. I love that this planner is inspiring, too. I honestly can't think of a better planner to have. I LOVE the fact that there is a monthly calendar, as well as a goal section. As a busy mom that is trying to start a business and finish college, this planner has been a LIFESAVER! I am looking forward to purchasing another one for 2017. I may look into getting an undated one, but I've been so pleased with the dated one.

Another feature that is great about this planner are the pages. They're thick and sturdy. I tend to write in Sharpie, and I always worry about bleed-through. This planner's pages are thick enough that my Sharpie doesn't bleed. It's so nice! There's not much more frustrating than trying to  schedule a week with last week's agenda bleeding through my current page.

This planner is fantastic. I truly love it. I honestly can't wait to get another one!

Close fitting clingy material.  Shows all.,0
"We have foster dogs and are constantly watching dogs, so it is nice to have a spare collar. I was skeptical about liking a different collar other that the almost $400 one we have, especially after a horrible experience with a cheaper one not so long ago. This one however is impressive and works well! I love the blue LED backlight, the user friendly operating, and the ability to for sound, vibrate or shock. After my bad experience with another collar hurting my dog on the lowest setting, I opted to try this collar on myself first (I know crazy). Which yup, means I tried ALL 8 shock settings on my thigh before putting it on my dog (I think my husband enjoyed shocking me). I can say that yes they do get more intense as the levels go up, and level 5 & above were quite the zaps!
Initial charge time is 3 hours for the collar and 3 hours for the remote, totaling 6 hours. However, that first charge lasted almost 19-hours of use over a period of 3 days. That is around how long our expensive collar lasts, so I am pretty impressed.

PROS:
- Lots of options: light, sound, vibrate, shock.
- Says it fits 8-21 inch necks, however the collar I have even fit the 110lb lab with a 23.5inch neck no problem.
- Easy to sync collar and operate remote.
- For sure works to 673yards (615 meters), which is the length of our open field. In the woods it seemed to work fine (I was testing with beep mode), but I cant confirm if the distance it works with objects between the remote & collar.
- Worked for almost 19 hours before needing to be recharged. Granted our dog barely ever needs any correction, so maybe not as long as a dog who needs frequent corrections. It charged fast though, I want to say both were charged within 1.5 hours.
- Easy to follow instructions.

CONS:
- I don't see a way to stop the remote control from having sound, so it always beeps whenever you push a button.
- There is only one charger. So you have to charge the remote and then charge the collar (or visa versa).
- I prefer to use a lanyard with my remote, and there isn't a way that I can see to attach one. This isn't really a con but more of my personal preference.
- Not waterproof (which is fine for around our yard use).

I am impressed with this collar system. The practicality and multiple mode functions are really nice (my expensive collar only has nick and shock feature). I was lucky enough to receive this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. All opinions expressed are my own. I am not affiliated with this company or seller in any manner. If you have any questions or want an update on how they are holding up, feel free to ask as I will answer honestly.",1
"Great Great Great!!!! These sheets are amazingly soft and have a luxurious feel about them. They come in beautiful range of color options. I got the white ones, queen size with border this time.

As for the sheets they are soft and not too hot. They wash beautifully with very little wrinkles and dry quickly.

Since microfiber is composed of very finely woven fibers, these sheets are quite thin, but, in spite of their seemingly fragile construction, are actually quite durable.
 I will Recommend to everyone

If you like crisp and thick cotton sheets, then these are not for you. These are soft out of the package. Also I think this sheets will be best during summer time as they give a cooling effect!

Overall these bed sheets offer superior comfort, a touch of style, and I hope they are durable enough to hold up to the frequent trips through my washing machine and dryer.

"As an animal lover I was a little hesitant at first about purchasing this collar but i'm so glad that I did. I have a 7 month old boxer pup that is a barker & plays a little rough, he was not responding well to other means of training & correction so after reading recommendations online we decided to give be this collar a try.  The collar arrived quickly much to my surprise and came with a little booklet describing the functions and warranty, a charger, remote, a tester and 2 different size prongs for the collar.  There were no instructions on how to clip it on but it was pretty easy to figure out, just carefully thread the collar through the slots on each side of the receiver.  I charged the receiver and the remote for about 4-5 hours each before I used them, I was a little bummed that they both need to be charged and there is only 1 charger so it took a while to charge them one at a time but luckily the charge lasts for quite a while ( I have had it for 1 week now and have not needed to charge it again yet).  The collar is adjustable and fit my dogs neck well. It has a beep function and a vibrate function which I used initially and as warnings for my pup. The beep & vibrate mode will go off for as long as you hold the button down which is a nice feature and it stops when you let go of the button. I used the vibrate mode on the highest setting of 100 it does not cause my dog any pain but it strong enough of a vibration to grab his attention.  There is a light function on the remote but I found that function to be pretty pointless. The LED screen of the remote does not light up which was a bummer for night time but not a huge deal since most of my pups issues were during the daylight hours. My dog is pretty stubborn so I have used the shock function, we started out at the lowest setting 1 and have not used it higher than setting 12 out of the 100 since that seems to be proficient enough to disrupt his unwanted behaviors. After only a week of use we have noticed quite a bit of improvement in our dog, now we are able to continue to just use the beep & vibrate modes as a warning to him and rarely have to use the shock function. We reward his positive behavior with treats & praise and the combination of that along with the collar seems to be working great.  My dog hasn't had any negative reactions to the collar, no marks or anything like that and it has not once gone off on its own.  The collar does have a sleep function to help with battery life but it wakes back up when my dog starts moving around, I haven't had any issues at all with it.
Pros- it's light weight, easy to use, adjustable, works well, holds a charge for a long time, comes with a warranty, I don't have to be in the same room as my pet for it to be in range, has warning option functions, was effective for my stubborn dog and affordably priced
Cons- the remote screen doesn't light up, there is only 1 charger for both devices, and the collar has to be removed from the receiver each time it is charged.

"The Eleter Women's Cross Double Colored Padded Push Up Bikini is a very cute swim suit. I got the blue and have to say, I love the color. I'm quite sure this suit is going to turn a few heads at the beach. One really nice thing is the cups are padded, which will provide some modesty when you're feeling chilly after getting out of the water. It also has straps that got over your shoulders, plus another one that ties behind your neck. There should be no wardrobe malfunctions with this suit. I'm not sure if it will lie exactly right on the skin, though, unless it fits perfectly. The tie behind the neck could cause the shoulder straps to bunch a little if they are too long at all.

The bottoms don't show the skin like in the picture. It does have the strap like feature, but they are sewn too closely together to stay apart when you wear it. The bottoms are still very cute. The washing instructions do say not to put in the washer or get any detergent on it, so you should be aware of that. It also says not to put in a dryer. I guess this is a suit to wear straight into the shower to rinse off the pool or ocean water with a toss over the shower rod to dry (although it says to dry flat).

HOW TO CARE FOR YOUR NEOPRENE BIKINI""

Neoprene can crease and mark easily. You should take extra special care when wearing and washing you bikini.

1. Store your bikini flat,as folding them will cause creases.

2. Hand wash your bikini in cold water after contact with chlorine or salt water and dry them flat.

3. Do not machine wash or tumble dry.

4. Do not use chemical detergent to wash.

5. If creases do form,you can iron them inside out,being careful not to place iron directly on to neoprene.

"I know, I am probably one of the few people out there not to give the prismacolors 5 stars.  Perhaps I read so much hype about them that they just couldn't live up.  Don't get me wrong, the premiers are nice pencils .  They go on smooth and have a great variety of colors.  I just found they  didn't come out crisp and clear like some other brands and due to their soft core, they wear down really fast.  They do not hold a point so it can be hard to stay in the lines.

I am sure it is just preference, but I have found other brands that I like better.  My suggestion to anyone who wants to order a set of prisma premier is to go to your local craft store and buy a few singles first and try them out.  See what you think .  But then again, all those other people who gave these pencils 5 stars can't be wrong so if your heart is set on it, go for it!  At the very least, you can say that you have Prisma Premier pencils, which in itself is a status symbol.  :)",0

"I ordered these socks because I am told by my husband that I have stinky feet sadly, and so I am willing to try almost anything to help prevent that issue.  I received the socks and immediately tried them on being excited and curious.  The first think I noticed that that they felt super soft and fitting to my feet.  On the downside of them, they are a bit too big for my size 6 female foot.  Now that being said I had my husband try them on and they fit him fine but he is a size 9  in a mens shoe.  When he slid his feet into the socks he was really shocked at how soft and comfortable they felt and fell in love with them.  So I guess I have lost my socks to my husband now lol.  But with the antibacterial I am not sure if they work with it or not, but I can see how they would with the tops of them being a mesh type material letting the air flow through them nicely.  I am very pleased with this order and I know that anyone else that purchased this would be too.

"This review is for Coconut Shell Activated Charcoal bags (4 pack) by Freegrace item # B01DPPBGPE.  I also bought Bamboo Charcoal Bags by Jalousie B01E9IZOR2 recently. I bought these not for my shoes or closet.  My father in law is over 85 years old.  His room has the senior people smell mixed with pee smell (he has his own bathroom in his room).  There's always pee in his bathroom floor.  I put these bags in 4 corners of his room yesterday (around 160 sf).  I cannot find any information about how much area each bag covers. I don't know how many bags I should use for the room.  I just use 4 bags totaling 400mg to see how it works and see the result.  Today, the smell is not as strong as the previous day, these bags do help.  I won't pass out when I walk in.  My bad, but I am just being honest.  So my main use of these activated charcoal is as a deodorizer. They can be recharged under direct sunlight, and they can last up to 2 years.  I do not like any air refresher.  It is just gross and disgusting to try to cover all the stinky smell with air refresher.  I think this is much natural and effective to absorb and eliminate bad odor.  These bags do not has any smell at all.  They can be put into your shoes easily as well.  I actually like both products.  They work.

Coconut Shell Activated Charcoal bags by Freegrace B01DPPBGPE:
Each bag measures 5.5 inch long and 3 inch wide (just slightly bigger than cell phone).  You can keep it in your pocket.  They are vacumm sealed in the plastic bag (thumbs up) as if they are stored in airtight containers, activated charcoal has an almost indefinite shelf life.  I bought this one as coconut activated charcoal works very well for air and vapor applications that target odor control.  Bamboo charcoal has bigger cavities up to 60 um. Coconut shell activated carbon has not only the bigger cavities, but also lots of micro small cavities as well. The small holes help to absorb the tiny particles in the air, and therefore, the more holes, the better the result. According to product description, these bags has 3X adsorption capasity of active bamboo charcoal.

Bamboo Charcoal Bags by Jalousie B01E9IZOR2:
They come packed in one plastic case with a zipper on the top like a pillow.  Each bag measures 3 and 1/4 inch wide by 7 inch tall, 1 and 5/8 inch deep.  Although these are not vacumm sealed, they come in a zipper bag, you can keep the unused bags in the zipper bag.  Or if you have those small vacummn bags, just put the leftover bags you don't need currently into the vacumm bags and vacumm it to longer shelf life.

"I received a sample of this hat in exchange for an honest review. While it does come in a few other styles, my wife really liked the color and fabric-pattern of this particular one and she/we are very pleased. The quality and craftsmanship are outstanding ... especially at the price. We live only a couple of miles from the Gulf of Mexico in a resort area and I can tell you from experience that most retail beach shops near us charge three or four times the price of this one for inferior quality. Need a beach or gardening hat? You can't go wrong with this product.",1
"I just bought my note 5 a couple days ago and needed a better case then the one that i got originally for it. I have been a bit clumbsy lately and cracked the screen to my old phone twice within a couple of weeks of each other because i didn't have the proper case. Didnt want that to happen again.

The case is a little flimsy, thats my reason for 4 stars but the clip is good. It give you the coverage that your need. The clip swivels and doubles and then the case itself has a stand which has several different notches to change the height. The stand is a little difficult to pull out from the back of the case but i am sure it will get a little easier with each use. Also a plus is my orginal case that i purchased fits into the clip. It also releases the phone from the clip fairly easy. I like that you can also have your phone facing forward or inward.

Overall it feels sturdy enough. Its not an outterbox or even close to it but it does work well so far. BUT i could see the stand  on the case wearing out in the future or maybe breaking, i could very much be wrong though. If you need a clip/case that will allow you to hold your phone on your waste, easy release from clip, possibly fits other slim cases and does not cost much, for the time being this is not a bad case at all. I would recommend it.

I received this product at a discounted rate for my hinest opinion. It is in fact my OWN opinion and in no way would i falsify an item when a hundred dollar phone is at stake but again this is just MY own opinion from my experience with this particular case. If at any time my opinion changes i will update my review.",1
"I purchased these curtains for my living room. They are sheer, so the sunlight filters in through the curtains. Unlike other curtains that are sheer, the curtains have rings that the curtain rod can go through so it does not tear the curtains. I've had this issue a lot with the curtains tearing from the curtain rods. The stitching is done very well on the curtains there are no tears or seams that are coming undone.  The color of the fabric looks very good.  The color is an even dusty blue tone throughout the curtains. The fabric is very nice and durable.

"These have to be the most phenomenal swimming goggles ever made. You are probably thinking what I was thinking before I bought these,,they are just swimming goggles so it really doesn't matter which ones you get. Does it? Oh it does. It really, really does matter. I never thought there was any difference either. But let me tell you about the best swimming goggles my family have ever owned.
They are these swimming goggles from Aquazone. They are absolutely amazing. They are not those little tiny cheaply made ones we are all used to. These are very well made high quality goggles.
They go around your eyes with plenty of room to spare. They seal instantly when you go in the water.
 We have not had any leaks. Another fantastic feature is they are shatterproof . And they are anti fog as well which is really great.
And if that is not enough, they also have UV protection.
And as an added free bonus you even get a really good pair of earplugs and a cool carrying case. What else could you possibly need? Oh, and they are guaranteed for life! This is one amazing product. Disclosure, I did receive this product at a slightly reduced price in order to try it out and give my honest opinion and review and that is what I have done here. I truly love this product and I know that you will too. I hope that you have found this review to be helpful.",1
"This was an awesome buy! The blanket is so soft and measures at 50""x 60"", just big enough to snuggle up with. Well worth the money to purchase another!! The red side is so plush and the off white is very soft. I bought this for my dad but it's a toss up to see who has it when I go over to their house. It's that great!! Will definitely buy another from this seller.

The shoelaces work fantastic for my son's sneakers. I found that he was so tough on his laces that he needed a more durable pair like these hiking boot laces. I also really like but they are the circular instead of the flat laces which seems to be easier for him to work with. I also really like the red and black striped to the lace.

"I frequently travel, and like to have an additional bag to take with me on day trips just walking around town.  This little beauty is great in the fact that it folds up compactly until you need it.  It's also light and the material is strong enough to carry a bunch of things. In fact, I loaded it with files and my computer and took it to work the first day I got it. I wouldn't recommend it for a school backpack because you can feel everything that is in it.  There are 2 compartments inside to separate things that need to be separated, and 3 handy zippered pockets on the outside, making plenty of room for organizing all your stuff.  I did have trouble using the outside large pocket zipper initially.  It stuck at the corners and is improving with use.  I have had trouble in the past with shoulder straps, but these are configured well for comfort. The product description was not accurate about them being padded, because they are not.  Nevertheless, I like the bag.  I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review.  It is a good investment for anyone in the family as a take along.",1

"I received the product for free or at a discount.
I purchased this bikini for my teenage daughter. She wanted a two piece this year. Typically her and her friends play volleyball and other pool games. I wanted to get her a cute two piece that I didn't have to worry about anything popping out. This is the perfect suit for that. As soon as this suit arrived she put it on and fell in love with it. A few of her friends have seen the suit already and want one. The colors are so vibrant and fun. The fabric so soft and comfortable. The only part of this that's a bit to big is the bottom. It just sags a bit, but nothing horrific. So based on my experience, I would highly recommend this suit but would strongly recommend that you order the size you normally wear in your day-to-day life. Like the saying ""Kid Tested Mother Approved"", absolutely perfect swimsuit for that teenager.",1
"I personally Love this dress! I was looking for a fitted dress like this for some time that could be dressed up or dressed down. I wanted something I could use as a cute swimsuit cover up that could pass as a cute easy outfit following our day at the beach or pool, since my family always heads lunch or dinner after and I don't find it practical to always pack a change of clothes because I am already packing for 3 children. In any case, this dress is exactly what I was looking for. I use it as a beach cover or pool cover outfit and it's perfect for me. It looks super cute on and has a cute peek a boo type cut out in the back. Looks adorable as a cover and makes for a simple outfit to be worn after! It has a ""body con"" shape to it so make sure that you like that look because it is form fitting. Form fitting can be a pro or a con depending on how you look at it ;)  It's a stretchy material but not T shirt like, it's thicker and seems to be a more durable fabric. I got the black with rose print and I love the design :) I haven't run this dress through the wash yet so I can update my review if I find that it doesn't wash well. Aside from that unknown I am really satisfied with this purchase :)

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I would purchase again in the navy print and I would also recommend to a friend. Very flattering even for this mom of 3!",1
"I've never been a fan of hiding a phone behind an opaque case if the phone was pleasing to look at in the first place. This case lets you show off your custom Moto X Pure and seems to add great protection at the same time. The only drawback is that the case is a bit thicker than I would like it.

"Estilo Stainless Steel Magnetic Knife Bar 15 3/4
This is a solid, easy to use/mount knife bar. It is sturdy stainless steel with an attractive satin finish. It is solid for the price. The back panel removes for easy mounting. Once you have secured the back panel on your wall with the two screws, simply lift the powerful magnetic bar close and it links into place. I found it large enough that I was able to fit all my knives plus an extra gadget or two. This product is really a what-you-see-is-what-you- get, but what you don't except is the weight and sturdiness of the product - at such a great price! This is a must for anyone with limited counter space (like me). There are others like this on the market but what I love is the sleek look and seamless edges plus the great low price. REALLY LOVE THIS!
I paid for this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. This wasn't hard even for a selective purchaser like myself. It really is a great product, not hard to install, and the results are more counter space and a sleeker, more organized looking kitchen. Yay! One less thing to be concerned about.
I really love this product.",1
This ring is so gorgeous. I bought this ring for my husband because he does not like flashy rings. I can honestly say I did not see how happy he was going to be. For a man who loves to be outdoors this was a perfect gift and he really loved it.

"I purchased this clock to replace an old iHome clock with the 30 Pin Apple charging dock that the speakers had also stopped working on. This is an OK alarm clock but I should've shelled out the money for a replacement iHome.

PROs:
Small form factor. This doesn't take up much room on the bedside table but the display is nice a big and easily readable.
Projected time. My husband thought this was a silly idea until he actually used it and realized it meant he didn't have find his glasses to read the time in the middle of the night.
Easy setup. I didn't even need the manual to set up the time and alarms. It was pretty intuitive.
Dual alarms. My husband and I get up a separate times, so its nice to have a second alarm.

CONs:
Its super hard to get used to how to turn off the alarm in the morning. It almost got launched across the room the first couple of mornings because the button is small and you have to know which one to press. It needs to be a different color or shape or something. NOTE: the one in the middle is the snooze button the alarm off button is on the end.
You can't set the alarms to go off Mon-Fri only so you better remember to turn them off Friday and back on Sunday night (here's where we really miss the iHome)

OKs
The speakers. My husband is an audiophile so he'll never use them for anything other than the alarm, but if you're on a budget they'd be fine for listening to the news or talk radio and maybe a couple songs if you like to fall asleep to music. Definitely not for long term music enjoyment but that's not really what you'd expect from an alarm clock radio anyway.
The USB charging port. Its on the back of the unit (the pic kind of makes it look like its on the side unless you look really carefully at the shot of the back). It doesn't come with a cable so make sure you get one if you don't have an extra. We went with a four inch one so my husband's phone charges right behind the unit every night, so far he hasn't forgotten to take his phone with him in the morning. If you're forgetful you might want a longer one so that your phone is in front of the radio.

Overall for the price, its a fine clock radio. We'll probably get another iHome at some point in the future and put this one in our guest room but it'll do just fine for the time being.

"Im testing a variety of screen protectors for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, in search for the mythical perfect product that protects my expensive phones screen.

This screen protector comes with a dust absorber, a wet wipe, and a dry wipe.  Right away you run into a problem though  the labels on the screen protector to guide you with installation both are labelled Back when obviously one should the back and one should be the front.  Its not hard to figure out whats going on here though, as the protector is curved so you know which side faces the phone.  The screen protector DOES NOT include a squeegee tool, unlike other products at this price point.  Ill also point out that the packaging for this product literally broke in my hands as I tried to open it  not how you make a good impression!!

The installation was difficult  it took me multiple tries to get this screen protector to lay flat, adhere to the sides, and most importantly to get rid of the bubbles.  Despite my best efforts and patience, I could not get the bubbles out.  I finally gave up in disgust and threw this in the trash, along with the broken package.

My search for the ultimate screen protector continues.

"I like the style of this one piece. The center mesh line is very cute and falls nicely on my body. The cups for the breasts are a perfect fit. the material is super soft and comfortable for swimming. One thing I did not like was the back, I wish it was more form fitting and a little more snug to the back. the cut it the back was a bit odd but still cute. The outfit hugged my curved hour glass figure quite nicely.

"This is a quality grinder set for course or very fine salt and pepper. The containers are made from thick glass and the grinding mechanism is ceramic and feels like it will last a long time. They look great as well and are very smooth when grinding both course and fine. There is a small wheel you can turn on the inside to choose how fine you want it to grind.

The included peeler is also very nice and it is very sharp so be careful. It makes easy work of peeling potatoes or any other fruits and vegetables and is a welcome addition to this set. The funnel is also a nice touch and allows you to easily fill the containers without spilling any salt or pepper. We are very happy with this set and would definitely recommend it over similar sets from big name stores for the same price.

I've got an ADC Pro, by Brunton that cost me much more than this goes for and this unit is equal in its anemometer. It's faster in response time than the Brunton in delivering a real time wind speed. I had it in a strong breeze the other day and it worked like a champ, showing subtle differences in the wind speed. If you like weather, this is a good unit to consider in my opinion. It uses a 9V battery, easy to find and put in. It measure in different scales that are easy to switch to. I love that it has a Beaufort Scale built into the display when all wind is blowing. Once upon a time, the Beaufort was the standard and was based on the way the surroundings reacted to the wind. This is small enough to fit in my pocket and I can't wait to use it in the fall, when the cooler winds begin to flow. I like to watch weather conditions and wind speed is a vital part of that for me. Pressure gradients affect wind and with barometric pressure, they are the key to forecasting. I'm just an amateur, but I love this product. You're definitely getting your money's worth.

"I have never used an infuser before, so I didn't really know what to expect. It was okay! I made Blueberry & Strawberry water with it. So simple to do! All you have to do is cut your fruit up, put it in the filter in the middle, then I added water and ice to the water bottle section, and left it in the fridge. I pulled it out about 3 hours later, shook it up, and my water didn't really have a flavor to it! There was no pieces of fruit that escaped through the cartridge, and when you go to drink from it, the lid doesn't leak. I think that maybe citrus fruits will work better so I'll give orange & lemon a try next! I am excited about the possibilities!! The bottle itself is durable and easy to clean and it has several recipes listed on the side of the box!! It comes with an unconditional lifetime warranty.

"I LOVE these ear plugs! I know, that's a really weird thing to say, but it's true ;) I'm an average sized woman and I don't think I have particularly small ears, but... ALL of the other ear plugs that I've used in my life have always fallen out of my ears. They had one job lol. These silicone ear plugs work *so much better* than those latex ones that you have to squish the small end and push far into your ear to get them to stay. Those always 'un-squished' and popped out, no matter what. And they were uncomfortable, too. So, I tried these hoping they would work because they look so much different than the others. YES - they DO WORK!! Oh my goodness! I finally found plugs that work for me. Because they are silicone, they shape themselves easily to fit the space they're needed. Each silicone plug has 3 'notch' like flaps, those help to keep the plugs secure and keep them from loosening and falling out. On the flip side, when you're ready to remove them, just pull the end of the plug and they pop right out.
These ear plugs block quite a bit of noise. My husband snores sometimes and these help to block that sound. We also have a neighbor who (bless his heart...grrr) likes to do very noisy yard work very early in the morning on the weekends ;) These work great for blocking that out, too. They're very well made and I know they'll last years. I like that they have their own little carrying case (it's a little bit bigger than a quarter - see the pic) which is great, it fits on my nightstand perfectly and could easily be carried in a pocket if using away from home. I have absolutely wonderful things to say about these!! One note (I'm not docking any stars) is that the shipping box is huge! This could be sent more easily and less expensively in an envelope, but that's just my opinion.
I'm very happy with these and will likely buy several more, some for 'just in case' and as gifts for sisters and friends.

"I love the idea of a salt lamp and all the benefits it has. This was a nice first step towards a later investment in salt lamps. It's small and didn't come with nearly enough salt to look like the picture. It was nice though. I felt like the lightbulb sat awkwardly inside so I had to maneuver the salt rocks around it to make it stay in place. As far as looks and functionality go though it's perfectly fine. I do like that it has a dinmer option on the power cord so that you can choose how much light you are putting out so that was nice. If you're looking to try a salt lamp out for the first time this is a perfect step in the right direction.

"This is a super cute suit, but its a little too tight, especially in the legs. I may try taking some of the stitching out of the legs to see if it makes a difference. The pattern is really really cute. I like that it is a pretty modest suit. The material feels just like other swimsuits. it is soft and silky feeling.

"This cardigan is on the thinner side but still very nice. The color is as expected and the fit is good, however it is a bit snug around the arms but not a deal breaker for me.

"I received this bracelet today and overall I like it. I plan to use it on an upcoming hike.
For starters, the paracord is robust.  It measures at 7"", so it's probably over 10' of cord considering it double woven and and inch wide. The rule of thumb with these bracelets is 1'of cord for 1""of bracelet.
The compass seems to work fine. I'm not sure I'd trust my life to it if I were lost in the backwoods, but as a button compass to give you general direction at a glance ,it works fine.
The knife is sharp enough to cut small things including the paracord. What I really like was it worked great with my fero rod. I was able to start a small fire with it.
All in all I like it and it'll be in on my wrist when I head out.
A full disclosure ,I did receive this product at a discounted rate for an honest review. And I honestly like the bracelet.",1
"my dog is an adult but I like to keep pee pee pads in case of emergencies and one underneath my trash can as my dog will forever claim it as his. the pads are not as thick as other brands but they are absorbent, the pee also does not leak from one side to the other and their best feature is that it traps the smell.

"So I probably open about 3 to 5 bottles of wine every week for the wife and I to drink after a long day at work. Just off the top of my head I think we own any where between 7 and 10 corkscrews. This one by far is the nicest one we now own. This corkscrew feels great in your hand and has a good weight to it.

I have just about opened 3 bottles of wine so far with this corkscrew and I just love the feel of opening a nice bottle of wine with this corkscrew, It adds a little touch especially when opening in front of family or friends. The Aluminium cutter is nice and sharp and only takes about one full turn to get off the clipping.

This corkscrew came package simply and was delivered on time. I would recommend this corkscrew to friends.

"These socks are adorable! They are a sheer pantyhose material. They are great for closed toes shoes that you want to wear socks with, but don't want the socks seen. The socks are made of 90% acrylic, so they aren't super breathable, but they are good for quick dinner dates, outings, church, etc.

It was ""on-time"" and shipped by Amazon, so you are assured of it's ease of refund if found defective.....I just received my watermelon slicer and immediately went out and bought a watermelon test subject. To use, you first slice the watermelon in half. Working with one half at a time, take the tool so that the rounded arc is on the top and the cutter bar is on the bottom. Starting all the way on one side, push the cutter part down and then the entire tool, creating your first slice. Repeat the process overlapping the last side cut line until you reach the other side. Then flip the tool upside down and grab each slice similar to how you would use kitchen tongs. It's that simple and comfortable to use and easy to clean. It is made from sturdy stainless steel.

"Every time I'm online looking at recipes and it says heat the fish, chicken, steak, etc., whatever protein it is I'm trying cook to so and so degrees; I cringe. Because how else are you going to know what the internal temperature is without one of these. This is a product that every household should have at least one of and this wrenwane is a good one to go with. I have a video showing it in use after I had cooked some chicken and let it set for a couple of minutes but I can't get it to attach. This specific one is really simple to use. Turn it on and stick in it the protein, the end. It also has a removable protective tip to stick on the end of it to protect from accidental stabbing of oneself or others, unless you want to poke them, then I guess you'll need to remove it. This is a cool and handy product that I received free for a Real and Honest review.",1

"Like a lot of women in their thirties, I've gained weight in my middle, and have been looking for shapewear to help me fit into some of my more fitted clothing.  I was looking for something that would smooth me out and hold my belly in/make my waist more pronounced, not anything drastic or corset-like.  This waist cincher works ok for those things, but isn't fantastic.

It closes easily, with a series of hooks like a bra.  My actual waist size was on the upper end of the range for the size I ordered, and while it was a bit of a squeeze getting it closed on the loosest set of hooks, it wasn't impossible.  I felt like it held my belly in a bit, but the top edge curled down a lot, especially on the sides, and it kind of crumpled down in back, so it didn't make me seem smoother at all.  I actually scooched it around so the hooks were in back, which seemed to make the whole thing stay up better.  However, I still feel that this doesn't actually function all that well as a waist cincher, and its best use is probably for dressup for ""adult"" times (my husband did like it for that!).

I received this battery at a discount for evaluation / testing in exchange for an honest review.  I was surprised and disappointed when this battery worked for 10 minutes then quit and then wouldn't charge.  I wasn't sure if the battery was 100% compatible with my Dewalt DW9094 and charger so I asked the seller.  The seller did not respond to my 1st mail but simply said to initiate a return with Amazon after my 2nd email asking about compatibility.  I'm disappointed as I'd rather spend money on a compatible and much more reasonably priced battery than for an OEM - and way overpriced - name brand battery.  There is no good reason that OEM batteries should be as expensive and overpriced as they are.  They are just rechargeable battery cells with a simple circuit board inside a plastic case.  I'm disappointed that this battery did not work for me.,1

"This is just what I was looking for! I will be attending a wedding next month so I was looking for a nice looking clutch instead of carrying around my big 'ol handbag. I still wanted to be able to fit my phone (Samsung Galaxy S7), lipglosses, a powder compact, and the usual wallet stuff like cash, atm card, and driver's license. When I received it in the mail, I was so excited to see if it would fit those things. It did indeed fit everything I wanted with additional room for more. It's literally the perfect size for me.

As for the wallet itself, it looks to me made very well. It has a genuine leather exterior and inside it's lined with a dark brown fabric. On the inside it has 4 card slots, a larger slot for bills, a large zippered pocket in the middle, another zippered pocket on the side, and 2 large compartments on either side of the middle pocket. It's slim but very roomy if that makes sense. It comes with a wrist strap attached to the zipper, which I absolutely love. The outside design is simple but stylish at the same time so I can use it for when I'm dressed up or just casual. I also like that it's black so it'll go with pretty much anything I wear. Overall I'm very pleased with it and look forward to using it!

"PRESTIGE HOME FASHION THERMAL CURTAINS , blackout your room.

 The blackout curtains are amazing. It can be a bright sunny day and they make it dark dark dark. Helps me to get more sleep. I like the quality material the manufacture chose to make these out of. These will help many people. Strange I know but I'll explain.

 These curtains work great and take care of the job that they need to do. The blackout curtains can take a bright sun room even and you hang these and once closed the room is very  dark.  In the past I've taken towels and other things like that with my regular curtains to try to darken the room and these do a better job. They're able to take all the light from outside and keep it out Side.

They will help keep cooling costs down as the air-conditioner won't run so much.  These will also help your floors and your furniture from being sunbleached. Because they darken the room so much I'm able to sleep in where before as soon as the sun comes up I'm awake even if I went to bed at five in the morning. These curtains are going to help people in different professions. Like a nurses that work the night shift - police officers that work the night shift -  just everyone works night shift. All I have to do is hang these in the room feel like it is night time. They would be fun in a room that's just for entertainment. Like one with black lights. They work well for the description of use.

 If you're the type that needs the darkening of the room these are excellent. But some type of people are going to be against the black color. I solved this by putting my black curtains up first and then installing my regular curtains over that. So when I don't want to use them as darkening shades I pull them back with the ties that they've given you and I let my regular curtains hang.

The material the manufacture has chosen for these is quality material. It's a nice satin shine with the silky feel. They're not cheap material that is lightweight they're heavy that drapes and hangs nicely. The way they have  been sown it has all been done correctly. It's all straight stitching, locked stitching and evenly spaced. The company definitely picked  upper grade material.

 I recommend the purchase of the product. I receive these at a highly discounted price/free to give my honest review on.",1
"Worthless! I finally put these on my bike and my friend's. If you screwed them on loosely, it would occasionally work and they were wiggly and loose. I was worried they'd fall off.

If you screw them on tightly, they wouldn't work at all.

Then, they were manufactured incorrectly and if you spun the wheel, the internal switch would go into ""OFF"" mode. If you turned it upside down - by taping it to the spoke, then it would work, but it wasn't attached to the valve stem.

Clearly a defect and a worthless product. Find one better and spend the money.",0
This is the 2nd one I purchased.  It didn't work in my 2008 Chevy Avalanche.,0
"I was very excited to try these out at our house tonight but our plans changed and we took them and used them on my parents grill instead and I am sure glad we did.  My parents were amazed at how well these worked and had never tried them or had food cooked with them before.
The bbq grill mat or oven liners come in a pack of 2.  These are extra large mats and longer than others I have tried.  They come rolled up but very easily flatten to the surface you put it on with no trouble at all.  No oil or coating is needed just put your food on and cook.  My parents were very skeptical but I have never seen my dad so happy grilling.  We had dudads which is a family favorite and contains bacon and hamburger which always causes flame ups and usually my dad does not like cooking them and has to have water on hand and makes a mess.  He was amazed at how easy it was to cook with the grill mats and glad the grill did not catch on fire once while cooking them.  They still have the great flavor and grill marks with so much less hassle and no sticking.  We also had grilled veggies which we no longer have to spend an hour putting on skewers we can just put them on a mat and cook away.  They are very easy to clean in the sink with soap and water and then we can roll them back up for easy storage. These can be used for other things like baking which we plan to do soon.  My parents were not very happy with us taking them home.
The only negative for this product is that a bit wider would fit the grill better so maybe one wider and one longer would be perfect for grilling and baking.

"I received the following item: Password Reset Key,  This is a great gift idea for any IT tech you know.  This USB drive is shaped like a key all you have to do is turn off any windows machine that you forgot the password to and turn on your PC and make sure you boot up to the USB key not any other device.  Once it starts to load up you should see the Windows 8 logo on your screen followed by agreement that you have to agree with then select your main boot up partition and select for example C:\windows and it will then give you all the users that are listed in the Windows SAMs file.  All you need to do from this point is select the user you forgot the password to and select reset password and it will make it no password.  If you are tech savvy you could click on the about user and copy the hash file and try to crack it with some sort of password cracking software.  Make sure you click on about user first before you click on reset password because if you did then there will not be any hash file to crack.  So for something quick this is the device to have in your tool kit this will make your life so much simpler.  Now for you non techies you could also use this it comes with a step by step instructions on how to use this.  I like this device because the ease of use and easy to pick out of my bag.  I would highly recommend this device.

"This is the worst mattress i have ever purchased nothing about this mattress is cool or even memory foam related or Gel.  Within a month it was sagging and it literally felt like sleeping on a pile of clothes you left on your floor.  I tried contacting and explaining to the Rep and told them situation and there reply basically was we can exchange for a bigger more sturdier mattress for your size.

"I am very pleased with this car mount.  I had a few concerns about it, but once I used it those went away.  My first concern was the quality, with having such large side holders and the little tabs at the bottom I was concerned they would not be up to the challenge of securing my phone.  They definitely held my phone in place and quite securely.  My second concern was the height of the piece.  I was worried that it would be too tall and obstruct my view.  I had no problem with that once I had this in place, in fact it was actually nice having it set higher, I felt that I didn't have to shift my head down at all to look at it while driving.  You can rotate the head of the mount so your phone is facing up or on it's side which is helpful as well. I love that the base is held by a large sticky suction cup, that means I can move it wherever I need it to be!  I received a discount on this phone mount for my unbiased product evaluation.",1
"This is a great deal, the iLLUMiShield (2-Pack) Screen Protector for LG G5 / Premium High Definition Ultra Clear / Invisible Bubble-Free UV Resistant Self-Healing Film w/ life time warranty for under $8 Sold! Fits great on my phone. Very easy to put on. Clean your screen attach and go. No bubbles like the sticky cheapo covers you normally get. This is the first time that I have ever used a screen protector like this one, and I will NEVER use another kind again! With the costs of phones going up protecting them is is a must, especially if you have kiddos that steal your phone to play games ( I have a 4 and 2 year old).  The packing is nice,which helped to ensure that the product was not damaged during transit. As far as the screen protector goes this really is an amazing deal!!!  Oh almost forgot the best part... It comes with 2 protectors, so mess one up ( seriously doubt you will, application very easy) you have a replacement. So basically you have just protected two phones for less the price then 1 from a cheapo store.

The pump comes with 4 different spray pattern heads, 2 height extensions, and a wide attachment for 3 of the different spray nozzles to attach too. The more water the pump is in the more/higher the pump will spray. The solar panel measures 4  inches long and 4/1/2 inches wide while the pump measures 1/  inches long by 1  wide. The cord between the solar and the pump measures 10  feet long.  The one thing to keep in mind is that the pump unlike solar lights does not have a battery that holds a solar charge so as soon as the sun doesnt hit the solar panel the pump stops working.

I love hearing the bubbling sound of water and I wanted the solar pump kit to use on my screened porch. I put the solar panel were the sun can hit it while the large glass bowel with glass colored gems sits in the shade. One thing that I learned is that when its really sunny out the pump can spray the water up high so make sure that your container is either wide enough or take the spray nozzle off and enjoy a bubbling sound. I love it now I can sit on the porch, in the swing and hear the relaxing sound of bubbling water after a long day.

"This is a great wig for dress up, Halloween or cosplay would be perfect.  It is not itchy and is pretty comfortable to wear.  There is an adjustable strap in the back if you need to make it tighter as well.  The hair itself is shiny and soft.  Feels very nice.  The bangs tend to get messy easily then you can tell it is a wig but, it is easy to brush and looks so much better after a good brushing.  I don't normally wear wigs but, I really like this one and was thoroughly impressed.

"Nice and compact; able to store with my ""ditch bag"" on the boat for emergencies. The compass is fairly accurate for the size, no needle but was simple to figure out that NORTH points forward from the Whistle end. The temperature gauge is coarse, but is fine for anything I would need it for; you can tell it was made overseas since it is in Celsius (no dual graduations for temp). The whistle is load, but not piercing, the LED light is a single point, not much area illumination but adequate for seeing right in front of you. The only problem with the light is, once the battery runs out, you no longer have the light unless you want to crack a seal and see if you can replace the battery. The mirror is fine for signalling purposes and the magnifier is like an eye loop so you could probably use as a sun focas point to start an emergency fire if required. The little compartment is good for waterproof matches or a piece of flint to supplement fire needs.

I received this at a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review, this is a perfect addition to my ditch bag emergency supply, so I am quite satisfied with the product.",1
"This is most definitely not your ordinary bug repellent!  I personally hate spray but repellent, especially for little ones.  It takes your breath away and risk getting in their eyes.  Rubbing on ointment or creams is always greasy and messy.  This is convenient, just slip it on and go.  I love that I felt comfortable using on my little ones, ages 1, 3 and 10.  Bonus, it is deet free and non toxic and uses essential oils to repel the mosquitos. They are waterproof, so no worry of swimming with them.  We have used bands from the store before and they were not effective at all.  I was a bit skeptic how well these would work.  I was impressed when we used them at the lake and had no issues.  They fit toddler to adult, truly one size.  My oldest son did not try it, and he was the only one who came home with mosquito bites.  The bands come in a nice reusable, resealable foil pack.  This is nice since we only used 4 out of the 10 pack.  So, the other 6 are sealed away for future use.  Also, since these are good for up to 200 hours, I just put the 4 we did use, in a ziplock bag and put them back in the pack, since we did not use them for 200 hours.

I honestly couldn't believe how sharp it was I tested it on bread, meats, paper, plastic and it slices with ease.
I will definitely be buying more in the future. I am happy with how strong and durable this knife is and not to mention that the handle grips perfectly to my hands. I just wish I could have ordered a bigger one. I also took the liberty of taking close professional photos for those who are genuinely interested, like myself, about quality control of the product.

"I wear size XS/S and I was hesitant when purchasing this poncho because there are only 2 sizes: missy and plus. I thought I may give it away as a gift if it doesn't fit me right. When it arrived I liked it so much that I decided to keep it for myself.

The poncho fits loose. It is not slinky at all. So don't expect that. I am not sure about the plus size. I am petite, 5.2"", and slim.

The fit: Missy size fit loose on me but the sleeves fit tight.

Hood: The hood does not cover my head fully so I will not use the hood as a hood or as a head coverage.

Length: It is not very long. It covers the butt but not below.

Sleeves: Fit tight and the length is 3/4.

Color: As described.

Fabric: Soft, knit.

Styles: I tried to bind the two sides and I got a cute new style.

I recommend the product to anyone who wants a versatile poncho for everyday wear. Just do not expect to use it as a hoodie.

"Soft and comfortable. Nice construction and material. For a form free bra they offer good support. I can go walking, garden, clean around the house and I feel comfortably contained.  I have others of these and they have fit the same way. I am 5 foot 7 and 120lbs and a 34c and I ordered a medium. I will probably also order the large for days when a looser fit works as well. These bras are so comfortable and they do not itch my very sensitive skin. I used them for breastfeeding at first and kept buying and wearing them long after that because you barely feel them. No binding or pinching at the shoulders or ribcage. Really nice for traveling under loose fitting clothing. I do not use these to replace a traditional sports bra for active sports.",1
"My husband and I love gardening.  We always have the best veggies in the neighborhood.  Last year we had to have help with our soil from a landscaper to get our PH right.  Now we feel more confident as our plants are thriving and the meter put our soil ph right where it should be.

Our main reason for this tool was not for the ph but for moisture.  We are growing Carolina Reapers (Guinness book hottest pepper record holder). For many reasons we have decided to grow these two plants separate from the rest of the garden.  The soul in the box always looks dry, and finger test always feels dry yet the plants were looking yellow and overwatered.  Sure enough.. The meter let us know that they have enough moisture even after leaving them alone.  It appears that the box holds quite a bit of moisture in due to its depth.  I have already noticed the peppers are greening back up.  I will always use this meter to test moisture before I give them a single drop.

I do wish that the company would have included some basic information regarding ph in the package.  It's a nice tool otherwise, and for the price I am happy with what it does.

I recieved this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised when I received the product. The whimsical design is bright and alluring, but not to bright it that it comes off as cheap. It feels heavy and sturdy enough to withstand the abuse that comes along with being a doormat :p. Being that this May has been more rain then shine it was deemed necessary to get a good quality mat, especially one that has enough friction to clean the mud off our shoes. So far it has fulfilled its qualifications and still retains its fun colors. I hope that this will last us a long time.

They are a nice thick quality card stock and they fit perfectly in the envelopes, which also are a nice thicket envelope. They come with 6 diffent designs and they are perfect for a quick thank you. One of them is just a heart, so you can use it as a thinking of you or really anything since the card is blank. I will be buying more of these when I run out.

"I really like this set of bike lights.  It is easy to install and the lights are bright.  The front light actually comes out of the holderived and becomes a flashlight which is such a smart idea.  If you ride your bike a lot at night and something happends (your chain pops, need to find something, hear something you what to check on...ect.) now you can easily remove the headlight and it becomes a portable flashlight.  The taillight takes 2 larger watch type batteries  (size is very easy to find) the headlight takes 3 AAA batteries that to me is the only downfall, I wish they were rechargeable.  I would recommend to friends and family.

My rating guide:
1 star: Not worth my time or yours. Keep looking for something more quality made. Its your money, Dont lose it on a poorly made product.
2 stars: Something gives the product a little kick in the right direction. However regardless of what that may be, Its still not worth the money in my opinion.
3 stars: Ok, so this item may have some really cool features, an awesome looking design, or maybe its just a killer deal. But overall the pieces don't all fit, something is off and you need to know about it before making the decision to purchase it.
4 stars: Alright now we're talking! This item has met all expectations, the design is sound, the build is great and the product does what it was made for. Its a great product that I can recommend buying. However, it didn't completely wow me. This is what most products fall under.
5 stars: Wow! This item is amazing; I absolutely love it. Not only does it meet all expectations but its a product thats so well designed, so well built and that has features that are so awesome they literally put a smile on my face. Thats 5 stars!

"After a few procedures that have hurt my mobility a bit, I am ready to get back to my previous level of fitness, well actually better- I hope. I knew the first thing I would need to address is my flexibility. A few months of sitting in a chair with my legs elevated have lead to some chronic lower back pain. At a fitness assessment I realized I was unable to touch my toes, so immediatly knew that is where I needed to start. I decided to go back to an old love, yoga and pilates to help rebuild my strength and flexibility- but I knew I was going to need some assistance. A friend who teaches pilates suggested I find a yoga stap to help my adjustment and allow for some accommodations that would be necessary until I am back to 100%.

There is not much to this strap, and that is a good think. Nothing intimidating here. It is soft in your hands, has a texture that will not slip and simple D-rings.

"This has become one of my favorites pieces in my collection of lingerie. I have been loving wearing this outfit!

When I received this product, I immediately checked it over to make sure it was designed well. I noticed that there were no loose threads and the item was sewn beautifully. I personally also love the design of this lingerie. My boyfriend definitely loved the way it looked on me! I did not size up as recommended. I am 5'1"" and petite. I ordered a M (US Small) and it was still a little bit too big for me. Although, even if the sizing isn't exactly your size, there definitely is a lot of leeway with this product due to its design. I ordered the red color and I love it. It is a bright red and is true to the red in the pictures.

Overall, this is a great lingerie set for  the price. It is high quality and beautiful. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

"I received this product at a discounted price in return for my unbiased and honest review. I am glad I received this HDMI switch because the one I was using prior had just failed. Honestly, this is just as good as the $50 switch I was using until it broke. It looks to be well made and worked exactly how it is described. The quality of the picture is great and nothing is lost. It would be nice to have a remote included to switch the inputs, but for the price this thing is awesome!",1

"My daughter and I are about the same size when it comes to bikinis. We usually wear a large and that is the size I purchased. It fit pretty much as I expected it to. And since we are similar in size I try to get ones that we both like so we can switch wearing them.
We both liked the color and design of this one so I decided to get it. It has a blue, green and white design. Almost looks to me like a Native American design to it. It doesnt have a clasp or a tie on the back which I like. I don't have to worry about it coming open or coming untied. It has four straps that come down from the neck strap and connects to the bottom part of the bikini. It does tie in the front so it makes it easier to adjust if you need to. The only problem I have with this top is that it has a pad in each cup but they are able to move freely inside. So they can become bunched up or move completely to one side. I like when the tops have a small hole inside the cup so you can adjust them if you need to. Unfortunately this one doesnt have that.
The bottoms are really cute with the same design. They also have to four separate straps on each side of your hips. They are more of a cheeky design to them. Overall they seem to be made really well and the stitching is good. They look to me like they will hold up nicely.  My only problem was not having a way to move the padded inserts in the top.

"Pros:
+beautifully made and fashionable with the large face
+thin profile
+awesome presentation (great gift)....comes in a professional, expensive looking, hinged box with a gift bag
+band is beautiful and comfortable

I highly recommend this product. I love this brand and already own their black, thin profile watch with a big face.
I also own a fossil watch, 2 relic watches and a sturhling watch. I will be purchasing all Burei watches in the future. They are very high quality and the price can't be beat!

"When I first got this hose splitter I was thrilled ! Felt well built and the levers are so easy the kids could turn them.

"These Hierkryst drop prisms are stunningly beautiful. They make a great addition to any child's bedroom or any window or light fixture that you wish to add a bit of sparkle to. I in fact had a unicorn pewter wind chime that while i moved to my new house the old strings got tangled and broken. I figured that this would be a beautiful way to add a new dimension and a bit of sparkle to an otherwise beautifully average wind chime. Because the wind chime is pewter i don't hang it outside, but i do hang it in my daughters bedroom window. These prisms add a bit of sparkle at night and during the day light up the room with an explosion of beautiful rainbows.

My daughter loves to sit and watch the rainbows dance across her bedroom walls for hours. Hands down a great way to add sparkle and light to any space. These are also quality prisms that can be used in a variety of crafts, to replace broken chandeliers, or add sparkle to old candelabras.

When these arrived they were neatly wrapped in bubble wrap, making sure to be packaged with care so that nothing was broken. I did find that a few of them had minor scuffs and scratches from the cutting process but i was able to buff them out with an acrylic polish that i have for crafts.

What Do Review Star Numbers 1 to 5 Mean?

1 Star: The lowest score possible. The product really does not reflect the product listing. No positives to the product.

2 Stars: The product is not exactly as described, either appearance-wise or functionally. The product may still be usable but its very different to what was described. The product may have a few faults.

3 Stars: Product is similar to what is described but still has major faults that may affect the overall effectiveness of the product.

4 Stars: The product is as described and functions well. There may be a few minor issues, but all in all, the product is solid.

5 Stars: The product is amazing! love it! This is the highest of the highs. I would recommend it to friends, family  its definitely a 5-star score.
Unbiased here; if the product is exactly as described and meets expectations, but the product isn't my personal favorite, it could still be 5 stars.",0
"The CloudNine Sand Anchor is going to be a lifesaver at the beach this summer! I am impressed by its ability to create just the right hole for my umbrella. I was having problems with our umbrella standing without leaning off to one side, and the CloudNine Sand Anchor has solved my problem. When I would use the umbrella to create it's own hole, I would have to widen the hole by rotating the umbrella down into the ground while pushing. Now, I can use the awesomely large screw to twist the holder into the ground, put the umbrella inside, tighten the knob that holds my umbrella firmly into place, and save myself a few tries at getting the umbrella in the right spot. I also like the pull handle that gives the operator a little more leverage for getting the screw deeper into the ground. The sand screw is super lightweight and easy to pack. It fits inside my umbrella storage bag so I conveniently have it every time. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review.",1
"This review is for Tripod, iKross 61-inch Professional Light Weight DSLR Tripod with Smartphone Adapters and Carrying Bag.

First of all, the delivery for the tripod was super speedy. I requested 2 day delivery and it was at my front door on day 3. This tripod was very nice, it has so many different features, and it seems very sturdy. I really like it. The set up was very easy and it has different height settings. I also like it comes with the carry bag. It comes handy for traveling. I would recommend this tripod for others.

"I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  The ECOdept Large Microfiber Towel was neatly packaged and delivered in a very nice decorative box which contained the large towel, hand towel and nice carrying case.

This was a very good deal and I'm very happy with my purchase...Thanks!",1

"I have to say this backpack is great! It has so many pockets which is exactly what I wanted, the backpack has a really nice all black style that looks durable, and I consider this product to be just fine for men and women as well. Judge yourself by the pictures. I purchased this because I am starting law school and although I know I won't be able to fit all those thick books in here at the same time, I am confident this backpack will stay with me for the next three years! If you are an organized person like me, you will love this product. Only down side is that there is no outside pocket for a water bottle, but I was aware of this before purchasing. Plus I realized it would be easy to just stick it inside with no issues. In conclusion, I highly recommend this product; it seems durable, stylish, and comfortable. I would be sure to update my review if something changes from now on.

"Knee length shorts, great for working out, running, cycling etc. As a size 10, I usually order shorts and leggings in Large to give me a little bit of breathing room. Seeing that these were said to run smaller than usual I ordered X-Large. As you can see, these leggings fit well. For those of you who like to be a little more modest in your apparel these are a great choice. The wide 2 3/4"" waistband does have a piece of elastic running around the top. There are NO ties to make the waistband tighter but I do not need it.

Laundry instructions say to wash at or below 40 but do NOT put in the tumble dryer!

The seams are well stitched and the colorful binding and inserts (I ordered black/green) are double stitched and very striking.

Product provided in exchange for an honest review. Thanks, Liz.",1

"I am in love with these amazing blue tooth headphones. I watch TV and movies on my computer so having a set of high quality headphones is crucial. These magicbuds fit comfortably in my ear and have great sound. They wrap over the top of the ear and pair easily and quickly with your device. They are a single button to turn on and then also have a control for volume. They pair easily with any device (I paired with my laptop, tablet, and phone) which makes flexibility of use exceptional. these are really a great product for the price. I highly recommend them!

"I received this product at a slight discount in exchange for my unbiased review.

I usually put that disclaimer at the bottom of my review in accordance with Amazons policy; however, I think it is more applicable in this review than in any other I have ever written. The reason why, is that I love these socks! With that being said, I could never justify paying full price for thesenot because they are not worth it, but because I just could not justify spending $10 on a pair of socks. I have purchased Nike brand socks like these at their outlet store for around $6 a pair.  Now that we have that settled, here is my review of the actual product:

The socks are made of the highest quality fabric. They are some of the softest athletic socks I have worn, and compare favorably even compared to my Nike socks. The seams are clean, and I cannot even feel them inside my shoes. The fabric breaths well, and my feet do not feel sweaty or sticky in these socks. To really test them, I wore them to work one day, and them kept them on for softball. They were comfortable to wear all day long, and them held up perfectly under activity; keeping my feet dry and comfortable.  The fabric has a lot of elasticity, and they seem to form fit around my leg.

Overall, I love these socks, but I doubt I would pay $10 for a pair Believe me, if I ever get another opportunity to purchase these at a discount, I am in!!!",1
This keyboard cover is great and just what I wanted! Not only that I received a free one along with the one I ordered!,1
"I ordered 2 strands of the multicolored rain drop lights.  We got these really quickly and packaged securely.  I wasn't sure if the light would glow all the way through as shown in the stock photo but they do and are so pretty!!  They are 20 ft long and have 30 raindrops on them around 3 inches long.  There's multiple light settings on them to use which is a nice feature!  The ""switch box"" (sorry! I don't know what to call it) is very well made and doesn't feel cheap at all.  The solar panel is on the opposite side and has a sticker that you have to take off before use but its held up great even during rain!

I plan on hanging these across the swing set and in the fort in our backyard for the kids.  I did not use them but they come with a steak to put the solar panel in the ground so installation will be easy or if you using them like me setting them up just like normal lights will also be pretty easy!  I did leave the lights out on the patio and they automatically turn on at night after charging during the day.  They also lasted longer than the 8 hours mentioned which is a plus!

I will update after Ive used them a bit longer but Im sure they'll last a good while.  I did receive  this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1
"My daughter loves stickers and the movie Zootopia as well. This is a very colorful, well drawn sticker book of the movie that you add numbered stickers to each page. The stickers are clearly numbered and she needed little help peeling and sticking them. We used it as a fun math lesson as she is still learning her numbers. We received 5 packages of stickers to get us started and now she wants to get m0ore packages to finish the book. We only had a few duplicates so I feel it was a great kit to get started.

"I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  I used a photo of a waterfall from iphone 5s camera for this canvas.  I like the way it turned out, but it's a little blurry.  This may have to do with the quality of my image, but it was well within the recommended dimensions and pixel count under the item description.  Additionally the boarders where the photo is wrapped around are not quite as thick as I thought they'd be.  Overall it's a great canvas and it came pretty quickly (about 1 week from ordering) but I wouldn't use this product again without a discount code. This canvas was needed to help stage a home that is on the market because we needed a piece of art or something over the bed.  It works great for that purpose but if you don't have a placement in mind you might consider not ordering this.  It's BIG!",1
I received this item at a discounted rate in the agreement to give my honest and true opinion of the item.

"From the packaging to the looks of this wine opener you know this is a class piece of equipment. Opulent is not an oversell of the classy looks of this device. Now to the device itself. Its sturdy and comes with an extra screwpull which is nice. When I used this corkscrew last night, it had a good heft to it, and the handle had a smooth easy pull when removing the cork. The foil cutter is a nice compliment to the corkscrew. Overall I think this is a great buy. I did receive a discount for reviewing this product.",1

"I absolutely love these Mr. and Mrs. can coolers. being that I have a wedding coming up, I have been going crazy with buying things related to newly weds. these can coolers hold soda cans ( or beer for the hubby to be) perfectly. I have found that they keep your beverage cooler on average for about and extra hour or two. if you are not personally getting married, then they would make a perfect gift for any couple that you know to be getting married soon.

"I really like this ice tray. I received it and it makes great nice sized cubes of ice. It is easy to clean, easy to fill, easy to freeze, stands on it's own & very durable but yet it's flexible. This makes huge size ice cubes at a time. The ice cubes are super easy to get out of the tray. Due to their size they don't melt near as fast as standard sized ice cubes. I was getting tired of using whiskey stones & this works great for me. I like the size of the cubes it makes too. This will be great in the summer heat for drinks because the cubes last a lot longer. It doesn't take up that much space in my freezer either. I did receive this product at a discounted rate in return for an honest review. I will always be honest with you because I'd expect the same.

"I just purchased a new 6s and wanted a good screen protector. These days the phone is a big investment and you never know when something could happen. Its so easy to drop or scratch or ...... I was a little worried about actually applying it to the phone but I had my daughter do it and she did it perfect. Teenagers can do all electronic stuff way better than their parents .. I like that this came with two so if something happens you have a back up. I don't like leaving my phone unprotected for even a day. My daughter had no trouble putting this on with no air bubbles. A little pressure in the center and it sealed right down. It was fast and easy and I fell much better having this to protect my screen. I like that it is on the screen itself , some cases come with screen protectors built in but I think it's better to have one that is placed directly on the screen. My phone works just as well with the screen protector than without it . There are no problems with using the touch screen , it responds every time. I am very happy with this screen protector. If I need another protector in the future I will order again from Aerb ..... great product ... thanks you !!!!

"The Tempo Steel Double Wall Vacuum Insulated 30oz Stainless Steel Tumbler Cup arrived promptly packaged in a well-designed box. Even though I knew the size of the tumbler, I was immediately impressed with its substantial size. Luckily for me, it will accommodate very large drinks, which is perfect for me since I love drinking lots of coffee! Also, the lower portion of the tumbler is narrow enough to easily fit in most standard car cup holders. Once I removed the tumbler from its packaging, I was able to see that it is extremely strong and will be able to withstand years of usage due to its stainless steel design.

I would highly recommend the tumbler to anyone! Its design makes it easy to clean, its highly functional and is great for taking on the go. For my review, I received the Tempo Steel Stainless Steel Tumbler at a significantly reduced cost for the purpose of reviewing it and providing my honest opinion. If you're looking for the perfect gift for your family, friends or coworkers, you need this tumbler!",1
"Failed within 2 weeks.  Lost all the apps I had moved to this Micro-SD card (was using this as extended storage in an Android Tablet, in this mode the tablet treats the SD card as system storage and stores apps, music, video, etc to the SD card).  Card failed while I was on a 7-day cruise and I lost 50% of my tablets content.  When I got back from vacation I tried the card in several devices and even different mSD readers for my PC and nothing recognizes the card.

I've been a big fan of PNY products and use several of their Class 10 standard SD cards in my Canon Professional DSLR, this was a major disappointment from a brand I've come to trust.",0

"I liked these sheets as soon as I took them out of the package, they felt very soft.  Then I washed them (following the instructions) and put them on.  They are now even softer (although, slightly thin - I guess compared to my normal sheets).  I have pretty much always had 600+ thread count sheets (until today), these microfiber sheets are really soft, even more so than egyptian cotton, I think.  I could not speak at all to longevity, but right out of the box and washed they are seriously comfortable (and at that price who really cares if it lasts 3 years or 5 years?)  Right now, I love the grey minimalist color and I think it will do great.  I will update in about a month.

Review Update: After A Month
They are still extremely soft, however, I had a 'hang nail' and it left a very small catch in the fabric (one thread equivalent --- less than a MM).  Other than that, it is the middle of July in the southern US here and it has been scorching hot.  I have good AC (and a Gel foam topper - which may create heat - but has not in the past), but I did sweat a little a couple of nights, but they were nights after drinking, so probably not related. They do stretch a little more than I might like. leaving wrinkles.  They are soft, comfortable, and cheap.  They are not 800 thread count Egyptian cotton, but at that price, no one can expect them to be.  They are good enough that they will definitely be in my sheet rotation and I will enjoy them.

I received this wallet for a free or discounted price for giving my honest opinion of its quality.  I ordered it for my husband because I wanted the safety of knowing his debit card and credit cards were protected by the RFID Blocking technology.  We received the wallet very quickly and it came in a very nice box.  It is leather and my husband felt it was a very good quality when compared to other leather wallets he has owned.  It has a lot of slots for credit cards and a hold up compartment for your license as well as the main fold for dollar bills.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants the piece of mind that comes from RFID Blocking technology and identify theft as well as credit fraud.,1
"I bought these shorts for my daughter.  From the beginning, I was a little worried about the Pom poms.  However I absolutely loved the print.  My 15 year old used to be very girlie but I guess at 15 it's not cool to be girlie.  To my surprise, she actually ended up liking these shorts.  The material is thin so very good for hot texas summers.  They were also a good length.  I will not let her wear shorts with her butt hanging out and I don't have to worry about that with these shorts.  My one critique is that the Pom poms could have been left on the short pockets but the ones around the legs are almost too much.  They also tickle her legs.  A plain white trim would have been much cuter.  I've looked at it and don't think it will be hard to remove the bottom Pom poms.  Overall the shorts are cute and they were sewn well.  The price appears to be fair for the quality of the product.
I received these shorts at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest opinion. I did not receive any compensation for my review. I am a fanatical online shopper and rely heavily on others feedback. As a result, I take great pride in providing an HONEST assessment.

"""It's okay"" is the most I can say about the Aladin Unisex Small Leather Credit Card Holder.  It does come in a dozen different colors, which is a positive.  The one I have is 'Coffee', which may not be the color of black coffee, but is at least the color of coffee with a lot of milk.
It contains no fewer than 26 credit card slots, which is about 23 more credit cards than anyone should be carrying around-- or even own.

Where it fails is in fitting the description ""Leather Credit Card Holder"".  It isn't actually pure leather, but rather, polyurethane (PU), bonded to a very thin layer of split leather that's left over when the hide is split to remove the best layers for quality leather goods.  The texture, weight and appearance of PU leather is different from genuine leather-- for one thing, genuine leather isn't as ""perfect"".  Back when the leather was still being worn by the cow, it got scarred by thorns, etc, and those marks will continue to show as slight imperfections on the smoothness and regularity of the leather's surface.  When new, genuine leather will smell like, well, leather.  This credit card holder smelled faintly of chemicals. instead.

All that said, if you have use for a small wallet to hold 26 credit cards (or credit card-sized ID cards) but don't want to spend a ton of money, this $7 wallet may be just the thing you need.

"I was so happy to find this lock which is available in different fun colors.  My daughter just got a new purple bike and the black locks are of course functional but this pink lock just looks great on her bike.  She couldn't be happier with it, not to mention it is fairly unique.  We don't see many pink locks when hooking up to a bike rack.  The functionality of this lock is perfect.  Don't let the fun colors fool you, this is a sturdy, functional, well made lock just like our other plain black bike locks.  It even has a mount to attach it with an easy slide quick release.  The bar on her bike was too big for the mount though so we just attached it as we attach all our other bike locks. The mounting bar could be used in the garage somewhere to store it if you don't want to use that on your bike. This lock comes with a combination but it can be changed to whatever you want.  We always use our birthday so it is easy to remember.  We changed the combination right away and it was easy to do. Also, this lock has a longer length than other locks I have.  This is very handy for when you are at the beach and the bike rack is very full.  Sometimes there are so many bikes that you can't get your bike close enough for the shorter length locks.  This is plenty long to reach even if you have some distance between your bike and the rack.  I did receive this lock at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  I love this lock and the color choices so much that I will probably get another one.  If you have a beach bike with fun colors, you don't want to have a boring old black lock.  You will be very happy with this bike lock.",1
"I bought this chair and as soon as I assembled it, it leaned slightly to the left. I didn't think this was a big deal at the time. I don't exceed the chairs weight limit. However, the first time I leaned slightly to the right, the anchors in the seat of the chair ripped out with the bolts still screwed in. Needless to say, I was dumped in the floor and the chair was thrown out. I only had the chair for 5 months, one of which I was on vacation.",0
"I have seen so many people wear this type of hat and it looks absolutely darling on them. I couldn't wait to have my very own, especially in such a striking color. When it came in, I was super excited to try this on and was a twinge disappointed. The hat is smaller than I had hoped, and does not fit my head as it should. Perhaps I am just a bit too big for its band, but such is life. The hat itself is great quality. The wool is pristine and soft to the touch, the color is incredibly vibrant and very attention getting. I have received several compliments on it, just by having it sit on my desk. So while it may not have worked for me, I definitely suggest this hat for someone who doesnt have a big head plus super thick hair.

The perfect size for our 3 year old daughter who is on the smaller side. Bought it for her birthday and it was an instant hit! Stable and well-constructed scooter that makes it easy for first-timers to get the hang of coordinating their little bodies for riding.,0
"I love this. It works wonderfully.  My husband uses it at work everyday.  He no longer has to use his teeth/mouth to hold screws/nails. He usually wears XL gloves and it still fits around his wrist. But it is velcro so it can be adjusted to many sizes. There are no excuses for losing screws/bolts/nails or anything else metal like that. They will stay close to you.
The only thing I don't like is the color. It gets dirty super fast and easy.
It shouldn't be used for heavy duty stuff as it may fall off, because it isn't THAT strong.

"I recently won a bicycle from a charity raffle, and I was looking for some accessories for this bike.  I was really happy when I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review.  I received this item in an Amazon labeled box which was packaged in a clear plastic wrap. The texture of bike seat is a stretchy cloth with a soft cooling like gel that is what I can describe as a Dr. Scholl's shoe gel or a mouse pad wrist guard gel. When I applied the saddle on top of my regular seat, it fitted really well. It strapped to the top and right over the original seat and is held together by a few strings and plastic adjustment knob so it doesn't fall off while riding it. As comfortable as it felt on my hand while pressing down on the saddle, it felt even better on my bum. I highly recommend it if your seat is hard and also if you would like to keep your original seat new. Long rides on the bike may make your bum feel uncomfortable but with this cushion, it is less irritating when riding.  The only downside of this product is it only has black color.  I kind of wish they come with different color so I can choose one that fits my bike.",1

These are awesome! I have blue eyes and am super sensitive to sun light and these block it out perfectly! Not too dark that I can't see but just perfect! I got them with the gray lenses and the silver frames! They come with a nice thick lens cloth and a travel case which is great so they don't get scratched! I will definitely be ordering my husband a pair in all black since they are unisex and look great on him too! I would definitely recommend these for a nice pair of sunglasses for sunmer!

"This coin purse is very well made with tight stitches and no loose threads.  It is a beautiful pink and really great quality.  The zippers are easy to use and the chain/ring are hand for attaching in my bag so I don't loose it at the bottom =)  It has 3 zippered areas with plenty of space for my money and cards.  I really love this one!
I received a sample for the purpose of my honest review, and I am very pleased with the quality and function of this change purse.",1
"I really liked this dry bag. I tried it out in the hot tub for a full test, although taking it out in the river or lake would probably be the ultimate test...
The material is very nice, it feels like an inner tube. Its easy to use all you do is fold over the bag about two or three times and the plastic blade holds it in place then clip it shut. The claps are sturdy and i really feel like it would keep even the most water sensitive things dry, i.e. Cell phone, iPod, or watch. I did shoot a video for everyone to see the test in the hot tub, but it won't let me upload it for some reason. I put a glass jar, a stomach wrap, and a post-it note pad in the bag and completely submerged it in my hot tub. I left it in the water for about a minute and then took it out. Then again i submerged the bag under water for about a minute. I took it out and pulled the items out and everything was still as dry as it was when i put it in the bag.  Overall very nice product i will definitely use often in the future. I would say it would be the perfect boating bag for all the things you need to keep dry. :) *Note: I received this item for free in return for my honest, unbiased opinion.",1

"The adapter does work... performing its duty is the number one priority and so this item has earned 4 stars... however I did not give it the 1 extra star b/c the quality is slightly lacking. Compared to apple cables this is still an aftermarket steal. The hdmi cable is also a very tight fit.

The cable itself functions just as intended and so 4 stars but as mentioned the quality is lacking so menus 1 star. The overall build quality is cheap and so it may not last long and in that case i may update but for the time being this item is working and has earned 4 stars. not bad.

"I am loving these foam coated resistance band handles. They are heavy duty resistance band handles cover with a soft but yet not too soft foam padding that provides the holder total comfort during their fitness use. These feature a perfectly sized carabiner clip to lock in almost any type of resistance band. A couple months ago I purchased some latex resistance bands not knowing that they were made of late, which I am allergic to. Thanks to these awesome handles I am know able to use the latex brands since they no longer have to touch my skin for me to be able to use them. The brands that I use with these are the flat loop style resistance bands.
I really love the comfortable feel of these resistance band handles during my workouts. They feel stable and do not feel like they are slippery, which is critical for safety and comfort. Depending on the exercise I am doing I sometimes use one or both handles at the same time depending on the need. We have a door anchor the also helps change up my resistance band routine. I love that these also comes with a lifetime warranty, which I will likely never need though because these handles are built to last, made with expert craftsmanship. With confidence I am giving these a 5 out 5 star review because they work exceptionally well and arrived to me so very quickly.  *I must note that I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.",1

"I really enjoyed this product! First of all, I'm a HUGE veggie noodle fan! I've been using veggie peelers and julienne peelers for my noodles and it's so tedious, time consuming and wasteful. This peeler changed the game for me. It's pretty simple to use, comes with different pieces (I LOVE variety!) and it cranks out veggie noodles in a fraction of the time. I used this to make zucchini noodles for zucchini pasta and carrot noodles for an Asian carrot salad. It worked out great! The only thing I wasn't a fan of is the colors (but that's just me being nit-picky and trying to find something negative). I wish it was offered in a more neutral color or something that matches my other utensils and appliances better but if that's the only problem, I think we're pretty good!

"***I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.***

I have tried a couple of other running belts since I started running a few months ago, and this one is definitely my favourite out of them. It's really lightweight and incredibly comfortable compared to the other belts I tried. It fits very closely to your body, so it doesn't feel like you're got this bulky weight around your waist. The pocket is roomy enough for a phone and a couple of other small objects, like a key or two, credit cards, gum, etc. There is also a nice headphone cord opening so you can run the cord through. I've really found this useful as my runs become longer, since music really helps me to push myself harder.

I do have two complaints, however, which is why I rated this belt a four instead of a five. First of all, the two bottles that it came with are incredibly thin, cheap plastic. If you squeeze the bottle at all, even just a light squeeze, it will leak. This is a bit of a problem, since they will get jostled around a bit while running and end up leaking. I don't really need the bottles, so it's not too much of an issue for me, but I really think that a product should function properly in order to receive a higher rating. The second complaint is about the belt length. I am not especially small around the waist (30 inches around the navel, give or take), but I still have to tighten the belt as far as it will go. I'm not sure how this would fit on someone smaller, but I'm guessing it wouldn't be snug enough to avoid moving around.

Overall, I think that if you can get past the bottle issue, and your waist is 30 inches or larger, you will really enjoy this belt.",1
I love these! I have had a few other Sperry Top Siders and these go great for when I have some black shirts. I like to be stylish and be comfortable. These fit great and are comfy. You don't have to be an upper cruster  to rock them in the summer. These are great for going to the beach or not wanting to wear socks and sneakers or just flip flops.,0
"I really wanted to like these pillows, I usually love anything that is cooling or is supposed to keep you cool at night since I get uncomfortably warm. I sadly can't say I'm in love with these.. Not really even like. I had high expectations as most of the reviews are pretty positive, I even gave it some time. Well first off I let the pillow off gas for a week and once it was good and plump you notice the smell.... Even after all the fresh pillowcases doused in fabric softener and scent beads its still there. Its like a harsh chemical smell that sticks with you. Once I got over that (it kinda goes away or you get used to it, I can't really tell) I still had hopes for the cooling effect. Well l woke up in the middle of my first night to go to the bathroom and when I came back it was still warmer than my normal pillows and still had the indention of my head... Not really sure I want memory foam that never forgets. All in all I think I would be happier with a cheap pillow from a big box store.

"So my gym buddy messed up his knee when he was younger from skateboarding and when we go to the gym he usually complains about discomfort and stress on his knee from whenever he lifts or does any exercise that requires the knees to move in a way that causes him pain. He could get a surgery done if he wanted, but he figured surgery could possibly make his knee even worse. I decided to get these knee sleeves for him to see if they would help. So far he really likes them. They fit him nicely and he claims they feel quite comfortable because they are made of nylon, which gives him the support he needs and shapes to his legs. When he first put the on we decided to start off with some squats and surprisingly he was able to do them and said the sleeves really did help prevent straining. If that went well, we figured that lifting would be fine and sure enough it was! He was able to lift without any strain and it really did a good job of preventing further injury. He was quite impressed because he did not think that these would really do anything for him but it definitely helped with the support he needs in his knee and would recommend this to others with knee problems or straining in the knees. I was offered these knee sleeves at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
"Now that the swimming season is back on, I wanted a new pair of shorts. I tried these out and they were okay. Quality wise, I liked them alot. they feel premium, the material is not too thin and the designs it comes with are not bad (I got the pale blue leaf with white). They were also quick to dry and did not retain that much water which was nice when getting out. Unlike other reviews, I found the fit to be about right. I usually wear a 29-30 waist and I ordered a medium and it fit well after I tied it up, so it doesn't seem that the fit for my pair were as off as others.

The shipping also took a while, but I was surprised that it did come earlier than the actual ship date Amazon gave which means the seller does send them out as soon as they can. One thing I was nitpicky about was the netting. Usually I don't mind netting too much, but upon wearing them for the first time, it deep feel a little uncomfortable around the rear, but that could totally be a problem specific to me as later it resolved itself or I just stop noticing. Also I am relatively short (5'5"") and the shorts come down a little low for my taste (around the middle of the knee). So if you are vertically challenged such as myself, and prefer your shorts to be a little higher, maybe opt for a different pair.

Overall I liked the shorts and the fit worked for me. I wish there were a few more size options but it is along the lines of what I see in stores and it runs a few $$ cheaper.

"I was very excited when I saw this four pack of picture frames. I have lots of pictures that need to be hung up but never find a decent set of picture frames to use, so needless to say, my pictures stay in a drawer until I get picture frames.

When these came in the mail, I couldn't wait to open it up and take a look and start hanging my pictures up. They are a nice set of picture frames, they are all the same size, which is nice! They are sturdy so not like the ones you would buy at a dollar store or anything. They are high quality picture frames, Nice!

They are easy to open (insert your pictures) and easy to hang up. What is also nice about this set of picture frames is you can create your own collage of pictures on the wall or you can put them in different parts of the room. Get creative!

"After seeing some of the other reviews, I was hesitant to purchase these sandals, but am SO glad I did.  I have had them over a month now and wear them at least 2-3 days out of the week.  They have held up wonderfully so far.  No bad smells, no loose liner and have held their color great.  The buckle at the side adjusts for a more comfortable fit for my high arch and fat feet.  The sole is soft and cushions with the step.  All in all, they make for a very comfortable sandal and nice enough to wear with business casual attire.  Very, very happy with my purchase.",0

"This 3 pack of bikini underwear were very comfortable!  I love the bright colors and the striped pattern of these panties - the black stripes are an especially nice contrast to the dark pink and purple ones.  The weave of the material is tight, so it feels like a quality material.  The elastic is strong and very stretchy - it does not feel like it will lose it's shape quickly.  One small issue I had is the tag that is on the front was put on right between the bow and the underwear.  It is a fairly sturdy cardboard so it is kind of hard to tear it off without ripping the bow off.  I like that these cover my bottom and don't ride up when I wear them.  The description for these say to hand wash and line dry, but I don't have time for that so I threw them in the wash with a load on cold and low temperature dry.  There was a little bit of shrinkage, as you can see in one of my pics where I lay a washed pair over a non-washed pair.  They did come out looking good though. I normally wear a medium and that is what I ordered. Even after I washed & dried them they fit very well, but I mention this because if you are almost a size larger, I suggest ordering up.  Overall, these were very comfortable to wear and feel well made - I am happy with them and would repurchase.

I received this item at a discount in exchange for wearing them and providing my honest, unbiased feedback.  The price I paid had no bearing on my review, as I have no relationship with the seller and I never guarantee a good review.",1
"<div id=""video-block-R3HIKTYKNGG2VS"" class=""a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block""></div><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/D1aGaT5D09S.mp4"" class=""video-url""><input type=""hidden"" name="""" value=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/015OFLiOouS.png"" class=""video-slate-img-url"">&nbsp;I got hooked on small portable Bluetooth speakers early one when they were a novelty. These days you can buy one for ten bucks at the ""dollar"" discount store  or spend a couple of hundred dollars for a fancy name-brand one.  Some of them sound amazing, due mostly to advanced computer design and a ton of electronic sound enhancement. They are not designed to be hi-fi in the sense of being your primary music system but rather a cool and convenient way of playing music from your phone or tablet wherever you are. I use a Bluetooth speaker whenever I travel to fill cold and impersonal hotel rooms with music piped to it from my phone.

Since Ive been auditioning the latest and greatest speakers for so long Ive got a garage full of them and anymore I only ever use one or two of them. And Ive stopped collecting them because for the most part I haven't seen anything new in a long time.

When Photive showed me their new Sphere speaker it didn't take much to convince me to make an exception and agree to review it (without any commitment to be anything less than 100% honest) so they sent me a N/C sample to test.  What intrigued me more than anything was the design.  The one I tested is almost the exact same color as my den. No one else Ive ever seen makes a speaker that color.  They call the color olive (they also make the speaker in sky, lavender, gray and graphite).  It sells for a reasonable price so I didn't have very high expectations for it sounding amazing but I could picture it fitting in perfectly in my den as a combo Bluetooth speaker and wireless phone speaker.

I want to make it clear that this speaker doesnt sound like a $500 audiophile speaker, not even close, but for its size and price I was blown away how enjoyable it is to listen to.  It fills my den with music when played at a reasonable background music level, which is all I would ever expect a small Bluetooth speaker to do. It also sounds very clear when used as a phone speaker.

Unlike the high-tech, plastic look that most low-priced Bluetooth speakers have this one has a coarse-weave, almost burlap cloth grill that covers every part that you see. The back panel is a matching plastic. The controls are mounted on top where they are easy to reach and they are easy to understand. No touch-sensitive buttons, these all work with a satisfying click and in some cases a pleasant musical note to inform you of the speakers status. There is a VERY subtle blue light hidden behind the grill to help with Bluetooth pairing and act as a pilot light. Pairing was instant and I haven't lost the signal yet.  There is a standard mini-phone jack on the rear panel to plug in directly to an audio source (like your phone) and a standard USB charging port.

The speaker is designed to stand on a table or shelf using a little tripod that plugs into a hole in the back and it looks beautiful that way.  I would have been thrilled if they had designed it with a mounting hole on the back so I could hang it on the wall. Dont tell them but I drilled my own hole and when I hung the speaker on the wall it sounded even better because it used the wall as a bass amplifier.  I didn't take anything away for the lack of a mounting hole because they don't promise that it is wall-mountable but I hope Version 2 heeds my suggestion.

When I first saw this speaker I didn't expect it could rate any better than average but after spending some time with it I love it for the beautiful design and surprisingly good sound.  Amazon suggests 5-stars for an I love it product and I agree.",1

I was apprehensive about having a magnet next to my phone battery but I used the item over the weekend and I rally liked it and it does not seem to impede or deplete my battery.  My only complaint would be is when I go to pull the phone off the base the base comes off with the tug.  It's not a big deal as removing the base after removing from the dash is easy enough I just didn't expect it.  It actually works for me as I don't leave the base attached to the vent when not in use so all in all it isn't a big deal to me.,0
"This is going to come off as a real First World Problem, but hear me out.  The world of golf is rife with all kind of gadgets, and the cynical amongst us (myself included) will say most of them are of dubious practicality.  Why, just the other day I saw a motorized club cleaner.  I mean, really  since most of us only use maybe 5 clubs in our bag during a round, is it really that onerous to brush a club by hand?  Anyway, its not uncommon to see weekend duffers with gadgets just HANGING off their bags, like Christmas tree ornamentsand since golfers tend to be a staid lot, its hard to reduce and minimize (hey, you never know when Ill need that combination bottle opener/scorekeeper/ballholder/divot tool thingy..).

So its in that spirit that I approach the PIQ sensor.  Also, in the spirit of full disclosure, I approach this as a user of the Zepp swing analyzer and the Game Golf shot tracking system.  I also use a laser rangefinder on the rare occasions when I can see the pin before I set up a shoteven on a par three.  Im not a great golfer.  But you need information in order to craft a strategywhich is to say, you need to know what you and your equipment are capable of doing before you hit that shot, and these kinds of devices have helped me quite a bit.

So lets talk about the PIQ product.  On paper it promises to converge the three devices I actually use quite oftenthe swing analyzer, a shot tracking set, and a rangefinder.  It also adds some new utility that I hadnt had before, more on which in a minute.

We start with the PIQ sensor, which is indeed what you are mainly buying here.  Its billed as one of (if not *the*) smallest and lightest sensors on the market.  And yes, it is pretty small and lightbut its still noticeable on the glove.  To be fair, a certain size is required in order to make the onboard display visible, but do not think that this is some tiny ultra-microchip device.  Its small, but not THAT small.  It is lighter and flatter than my Zepp though, and that display does offer utility that the Zepp doesnt havenamely a range display that will tell me at a glance just how far I have yet to go on my particular hole, and just how long this day is therefore likely to be.

Yep, PIQ has partnered with Mobitee as a source of all that course info.  For the uninitiated, Mobitee is a company that creates and maintains course information for many thousands of courses across the world.  Its really big in Europe, but US courses are well representedeven municipal courses.  I scanned their available courses (you can Google ""Mobitee available courses"" to navigate to their page listing all their covered courses worldwide) and I couldn't find a single one in my area that isn't included in their stable.  So I was very assured that this would not be an unusable gadget, or that Id have to steer my group to a particular course just so I could use this gadget.  Further, while Mobitee usually charges about $25 for their app and data, here the price is included with the PIQ equipment so there are no additional charges.  The app deserves its own separate review, but suffice it to say that you want to download the course you're playing to your phone, and it offers you utility that greatly eclipses the regular old handheld rangefinder.  I really like using my phone as the rangefinderit uses the onboard camera along with GPS and a neat kind of heads-up display that helps me line up my shot.  In sum, the Mobitee partnership is a real value add for the PIQ devices, and the kind of thing Id really like to see more of in the golf world (Hey Mobitee...how about a drink-cart-summoning button in the app.?).

The PIQ device communicates with the phone via Bluetooth and it gets real time ranging information that is displayed on your glove.  So this is the second nice thingif I know what direction Im hitting toward, I don't even have to pull out a rangefinder, as its already on my glove.  This makes me look like I know exactly what Im doing.  I dont, but keeping up appearances is part of the game.  I found that the ranges displayed were accurate (within a couple of yards) as compared to and verified with my laser rangefinderand I didn't need to line up the laser, aim for the pin, and hope for the best.  It also works more reliably than the laser, especially if there were haze, obstructions, or whatever.

It didn't end here, as the device uses NFC tags (attached to your clubs) to track shots for you.  This creates a kind of interesting pre-shot ritual.  You tap the end of the club to your PIQ device to register which club you're using.  You then take your shot, the PIQ analyzes your swing, and when you get to where your ball landed you do your tap ritual again for the next shotand the device/app registers how long you hit.  Over time it will use your actual performance to recommend appropriate clubs for you to use for particular shots.  It also keeps score for you, which for me is less desirable but I guess I have to take the bad with the good.  Better golfers will enjoy the shot tracking, and indeed the app will catalog your more brilliant shots with which you can share to your social media buddies.  You can still kind of game the system (for instance, if you lose the ball and would otherwise have to take a penalty strokeyou can miraculously find the ball a few yards short of the green.) but on balance its a pretty easy and no-real-effort-required way to keep track of your shots.  I was going to criticize the use of NFC and the whole club tapping ritual, but honestly I cant think of a better-yet-still-practical way to do it.

The PIQ device, like the Zepp, takes data from a bunch of difference accelerometers and sensors to analyze your swing.  Ill say that I was seriously happy with the Zepp as it pointed out flaws in my swing that I hadnt noticed until I saw a third person representation of it.  For this, I'd have to say that I prefer the Zepp because of that...the PIQ score is helpful, and the track of the tempo/speed/swing path is also helpful, however, I like the Zepp presentation better.  BUT, that isn't to say that the PIQ is useless...it isn't.  You can also use the PIQ for practice at the range, same as the Zepp, but having it integrate with actual game performance and use that data for overall coaching/game help is very helpful.  In my opinion, the integration of all of this makes it more useful than the Zepp for actual play and improving your game.

Im trying not to be hyperbolic here, but this little thing is packed with potential.  It really transformed my game as well as the way I approach things like strategy, club selection, and all of that.  It is a real convergence system and it synthesizes data across a variety of sources and turns it into actionable information that I can use.  Thats the highest praise I can give any device like this.  The combination here gives me utility that I didn't have with my separate devices, inasmuch as everything is all connected, seamless, and easy to use.  Im not a super techie but I was getting the hang of it after a while.  The biggest learning curve will likely be remembering to tap the club tag to the PIQ device, but thats just learning a habit - I was used to doing it with my Game Golf system so this worked pretty seamlessly.  Having the device hanging off the glove may be a turnoff for some, but I was honestly used to having the Zepp device there so it wasn't as big of a deal for me as it would be for other folks.  Rest assured that after a while you barely notice it.  Having the range info on the device, though, is a big value add and I like it.  In sum, its a good system that successfully blends devices for me and helps make the game more manageable.  Its a good product and Im really happy with it.",0
"I have never given my dogs supplements until I read an article saying how good they were for my dogs.  I did further research and found that omega 3s were amazing for them.  I have always had mutts, and we feed them generic hard dry dogs foods. So when I add the Animal Prime soft gel capsules into their foods they look at me like, you want me to eat this? I have to cover it in peanut butter to get them to eat it, instead of around it. But I already see a difference in their coats.  They are super shiny and beautiful.  My older dog has sore joints after a run, and I find that since I started this pill regime he spring back faster, and ready to go for more.  I also noticed his dry skin as dissipated.  My only regret is that I did not give them these supplements sooner.

"""Perfect"" is quite a strong word that I do not use lightly. It implies something that is created that needs no improvement. This pillow, indeed, is perfection.

Why? It's the exact size for people to use while traveling or camping. It's not too big to be cumbersome yet not too small to not provide full cushioning for your head while you sleep. The cover is a plush microsuede on one side and a cotton smooth sheet material on the other. The best of both worlds! The interior is filled with shredded pieces of memory foam. This serves a dual purpose -- to provide support for your neck and head while using it, and for easily compressing the the pillow into it's self-contained storage bag.

Tip: Since this pillow does contain memory foam, I recommend letting it decompress when you receive it and letting it air out by a window for a day or two because it does have the usual (and unavoidable) memory foam smell. Personally (and oddly, I admit) I like the smell of memory foam so I did not need the ""air out"" phase.

I like this pillow so much that I really wish it came in larger sizes to use at home on my bed! There are certainly other memory foam pillows similar to this, but they all use Bamboo Covers. Those are fine, but this cover is exactly what I dream about -- especially when I'm using it.

Most pet seat covers are not quilted and are very slippery.  They don't offer much for your dog to grasp when you are driving and they end up sliding everywhere.  This pet seat cover is great. The quality is great. It is quilted which offers a nice little plush area for your dog to comfortably lay. It is soft and offers great gripping for your dog to stay comfortably and not slide everywhere.  This pet seat cover offers little grips behind the seat cover that keep it from sliding all over the back seat. Once you get it attached it stays put. My dogs are now more comfortable on our road trips. My back seat stays clean and dry. I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.,1
"This is a very nice monitor that has loads of features. I find it to have a beautiful picture, with easy setup, good screen controls, and useful screen dividing software.

I was pleased from the moment I took this out of the box. I hooked it up with HDMI rather than DVI, and the picture is excellent. I can't seem to find the specs on how fast it is, but I have observed no ghosting at all. Videos look great, and for web development it is really great. They are not kidding about the bezel either - it is the thinnest I've ever seen. The contrast ration is listed on the LG website as ""Mega"", whatever that means, but the monitor has very sharp character rendering, depending on the preset you select. I can tell this is an IPS monitor; I cannot find a viewing angle that does not work - it is great for working with another person beside me.

I've seen some folks comment on the new stand. It seems to be stable to me, and I like the look.

The monitor has great on screen settings, controlled by a small peg directly under the center. Pressing it brings up the on screen menu, and then you go though it and select the various options. I ended up using the ""Cinema"" preset, although there are a number of others, as well as custom settings where you define your own contrast and etc. One thing I do NOT like is the two reader modes, which are supposed to make it easier on the eyes. They are too dim and too brown.

In addition to the on screen controls, you can install a program that allows you to control other aspects. I installed it on Windows 10 (directly from the website, since my laptop has no internal CD), and it works really well for splitting the screen into sections. You make the selection and the screen instantly changes. They also include a Picture-In-Picture mode, where you drag a program into the ""PIP"" area. This would be useful to monitor a web input while making a YouTube video, for example. Supposedly the program will let you control aspects of the screen as well, but the version I got only has the split and some settings for text size, which I prefer to set via Windows menus.

The only thing to note with this monitor is the price. It is about two hundred more than similar 24 inch monitors that are not IPS. The screen is really good, and it performs exceptionally well. I would say that if you can afford it, this is a great monitor. It is better than the 24 inch LG non-IPS I also own.

Summary: A pricey monitor that provides great performance and picture. Highly recommended.",0
"I have tried several other LED camping lanterns and this one combines the best properties.  Some are too small, some are too big and heavy, this one is less than 7 inches high and big enough.
This lantern is the brightest I have tried at 450 lumens and you have several light options and can adjust the brightness !!!

You can load this lantern with 3 or 6 AA batteries.  With 3 you still get the same lighting options and brightness.  With 6 the light will last even longer.  Even with 3 and using the brightest setting it can last for 3.5 to 5 hours.  With 6 expect it to last 7 to 10 hours !!!

Some great features - it saves the last setting you had.  Turn it back on to the same brightness, same lighting options.

When setting the brightness, it will flash 3 times when you hit the max.

I love the battery indicator - lets you know when its time to replace.

The base includes the clasps to hang the lantern and fold away when not in use.

Lantern is water resistant, although I got caught in a rain storm and it got very wet with no issues.

This lantern is well designed.  Has a great feel to it, a rubber base and easy screw lid to replace batteries.
Small enough to carry in a backpack, keep in a glovebox or in a drawer in your house.

I will use as an emergency light in the house in addition to taking on a camping or hiking trip.

With the LED's rated at 50,000 hours - I will have this lantern for a very long time.

Customer support is a phone call away if the instruction manual is not enough.  The warranty is for 12 months, but there is a card in the box to extend it for 6 months.  This is another quality product from Taotronics.

I purchased at a discount in exchange for an honest and thorough review.  I always give an honest review regardless of my own purchase or not.

"I ordered these rechargeable batteries after I realized my Panasonic phones could hardly hold a charge.  After 7 years (a good amount of time!), I used these batteries to replace the old ones and voila!!  ...practically a new phone again!  For the price, these are WONDERFUL batteries!!

Don't forget - replace your rechargeable batteries from time to time.  They don't hold up forever!",0
"I admit, I look at the bad reviews before I get something if there are any, and I was a tad worried about this. I didn't find any of them to be a problem, though. (I wanted this to take tent camping, since my wife is always complaining about the heat trapped in there.)

Pros:

-Pretty portable. Doesn't weigh much, and in size is about 6.5""Hx4.5""Wx2.5""D.

-Rechargeable and replaceable 18650 battery. 18650s have a pretty big power output when compared to AA or AAA and such- which means that one 18650 can run this thing longer than about three AAs. (My understanding of the why this is, since the mAh of one AA and one 18650 doesn't seem to be that much different: nominal voltage. That means that basically, the 18650 puts out more current for longer- 3.7 is the nominal voltage. An alkaline AA is only 1.5V.) I can also keep some spare 18650s on hand and switch them out during a camping trip- and recharge when I get home. Cheaper in the long run.

-It kind of puts out an alarming amount of wind on ""Powerful Wind Mode"". It's a nice soothing breeze on Sleep Mode, and enough to really break your heat on Natural Wind Mode. Also, the highest mode is the only one I feel is a little noisy- but that isn't even that loud.

-It seems to have a pretty good battery life. I charged the battery and I've been running it here and there for about five days- mostly on the lower wind settings. (The weather hasn't cooperated enough to really need it that much.) It's still going with probably about four or five hours of use on the lower speeds.

So far, I don't have any complaints about it. It's compact, portable, rechargeable, and quite frankly puts out a good bit more wind than I was expecting. (Just really, take the plastic wrapping off of the battery before you plug it in. And if you can't tell positive from negative on the 18650- hint: the postive end is the one with the flat button and the negative end is smooth, just like nearly any other battery- refer to the Internet for photo help. It's pretty easy to figure out with a simple search.)

Awesome. honestly love these socks.  They are snug and comfy.  I wish I got the short ones as well.  My feet are not sweaty.  The compression is snug but not too tight.  Great for cycling.

"Looks like a clone of a Parker pen by Hero. It's a great pen when it writes. It's not hard to get the ink flowing though. A little agitation with some LIGHT shaking of the pen and the ink flows good as new. The nib is very fine and the slightly indented grip section is nice when you're writing. Just a note though, it's super thin. I have small hands and this was a little thin for me. Solid metal construction. The hooded nib is a nice touch.

Very nice arm sleeves. They fit my arms just perfectly. They are very soft. I'm not so sure what exactly they are supposed to do or if they are supposed to make your arm feel any better. The design on them is very cool. I received this at a discount rate for an honest review.,1
"For a sub fifteen bucks price this is a good external enclosure to buy. It's not made of aluminum but plastic. The blue side looks like metal and has a smooth finish to simulate metal. The opposite side is all black and has more of the regular plastic look and feel. The provided USB 3.0 cable is about 1m (3ft) and is fairly thick. There is a blue power light that blinks a pink/red when there is disk activity. Installing the drive is a breeze once you get the case cover off (on the black side of the enclosure). Be careful as there are three tabs that you could accidentally break off when trying to remove the cover. Mine came with an extra foam piece that you could apply to the inside of the black case cover. There's already one there but it's thinner than the extra one. I'm not sure if it's an extra one to add if needed, or it's a replacement. The instruction book doesn't indicate there should be an extra foam piece. Overall, I would recommend it if you're not looking to spend a lot of money and need a 2.5"" SATA enclosure for short term use.
Pros:
1) Tool free.
2) USB 3.0 drive.
3) SATA 6G.
4) Love the black color.
Cons:
1) Not Aluminum but plastic.

"I like the gloves, see the pictures, these are nicely made and good quality comes with a carrying bag. I got these mainly for weightlifting and must say the design on palm works great as anti-slip or improve the grip and also I believe does improve the friction

Doesn't feel uncomfortable or much problem with sweating in your palm

Only thing I would have liked more and would have given it 5 stars is if these would have some wrist grip, these gloves does not go till your wristbut thats does not overweight all the Pro's.

"This pillow is simply wonderful! It arrived in a very timely manner and was packaged nicely in a zipper sealed bag. First thing I noticed pulling it out of the bag was the softness to the outer material! The stitching is well done and the overall look and feel of the pillow is magnificent! After sleeping on it for a week, my neck has never felt better! I don't wake up all tired and cranky anymore as well, it really gives me a good deep sleep and no kinks in my neck either. I'm very happy with this pillow! My husband had had some issues with his neck as well, used it for a couple nights and was much better. Very good pillow here!

"This is a great container that you can use for just about anything. I used this to store some cereal I have, but this would be great for any type of powder. The container comes with a spoon that attaches right to the lid.  The containers is extremely easy to open. There is a very easy push button that snap the lid on and also you push the button to release. It is far superior than using a regular tupperware container. The seal on the container is very strong and you can even have liquid in there without worrying about it spilling. I love the easy pop lid. It is great for my daughter so she can get her cereal without having to worry about waiting for me to do it for her. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

"I have friends over very often, and a lot of times during our gatherings, I will put out crackers and cheese as appetizers before we eat. This is primarily because I'm just starting out, and I can't afford anything too expensive to serve my guests. When I came across the LANSH Bamboo Lazy Susan 12-Inch Rotating Serving Tray, it seemed to be a wonderful way for me to serve my guests. After a bit of research about the item, I decided to order it.

This Lazy Susan has a natural earthy look to it. The item is made from bamboo, which is the fastest growing plant in the world. Because of bamboo's fast growth rate, it is much more eco friendly to use products made from it than using wood, for instance. Bamboo is natural and durable and great for anyone interested in environmentally sensible alternatives to traditional materials.

The item is quite attractive, and several of my friends have commented on how nice it looked on my table. This Lazy Susan does require hand washing, but since the surface is smooth, it is very easy to clean. I love that I can simply place items on the Lazy Susan, and guests are able to spin it to reach for the item that they want. It's very convenient, and it rotates smoothly. I am very pleased with this Lazy Susan!

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!",1

"I'm not sure why so many people seem to be having trouble with this mirror.

Maybe we have different definitions of fogless? I don't expect this mirror to stay without fog the entire time I am in the shower. When I grab the mirror and hit it with water before I shave - it doesn't get fogged up when I am using it.  I was using hand mirrors in the shower previous to this. It would instantly get fogged back up if I wiped it or hit it with water. I would break a mirror at least once a year too.

Maybe some people have high expectations or I have low expectations?

"The NeWisdom Galaxy S7 Carbon Fiber case is very nicely made and well designed. I really like the thin profile and good protection this case provides. There is a good sized lip that protects the screen while face down and the back is thick enough to give the camera lens good scratch protection but still thin enough to still enjoy the thin design of the Galaxy S7 while in the hand and pocket.  This case provides enough protection to give me the confidence that my expensive phone will survive a drop from a significant height.

The materials used to make this case are very nice to touch. It's very obvious when when held that the back of the phone is not made of real carbon fiber but instead a carbon fiber pattern cloth like material. It's soft, grippy and comfortable. The carbon pattern wrap goes almost all the way around the sides and adds a little bit of stiffness to the sides of the case while on the phone. Since this is a single piece design case, the carbon fiber wrap does not separate from the TPU at all and is well attached with no seams or sharp edges. I would also like to add that there is absolutely no branding on the outside of the phone which adds to the clean and simple look of this case.

I would recommend this case to anyone who wants decent protection with a minimalistic phone case and loves the carbon fiber look.

"These Piper round toe high heels by Riverberry are a great shoe to add to your collection whether it be for wearing to work, or just a night out on the town they will fit all your needs.  I got these in the shiny red color and the are hot!  The shoes themselves appear very well made, and they even come with an extra set of the heel protectors for the bottom of the heel.  They are very shiny and nice, and I don't see any imperfections in the workmanship.  The heel measures as stated, and they are actually fairly comfortable for being as high a heel as they are.  My feet aren't used to such a high heel, so I can only wear them for a few hours, but I'm sure most people would be fine in them all day.  I did order my normal size and they fit me great.  They do tend to run a little wide which is perfect for me because I do have wide feet and I have a problem with most heels I buy being too narrow and causing my feel to be squished all day.

"I am always hesitant to purchase bathing suits online, but based on such positive reviews, I took the chance with this one. I also received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review, so it was especially worth it. The design is super cute and the coloring is as it appears in the picture. However, under some lighting, the brown doesn't look very brown. It appears washed out or like a shade of dark gray. Either way, it is still a super cute and high quality bathing suit.

The padding is a bit heavy, so if you are any bigger than a C cup, I don't recommend this bathing suit. It really does provide lift and push up. The bathing suit fits me well. The bottoms are a bikini cut so they do show quite a bit, but for me, the bottoms and the top both fit well.

My only complaint with this bathing suit would be the brooch on the front. It looks great but it doesn't seem to be stitched onto the suit well. Other customers mentioned the brooch falling off and I can definitely see that happening. I haven't worn mine in the water yet, so I don't know how the quality is, but judging from how it looked when I took it out of the package, I will be reinforcing it with my own stitching before I wear it.

Overall, I am very happy I purchased this bathing suit! It's flattering, pretty, and well made. I am pleased with this purchase.",1
"Dust mites! Ick! I am a great believer in protecting all the mattresses in our house. The obvious reason with kids is accidental wettings which can ruin a mattress just like that BUT even as adults we are still sweating etc. and you do not want that going through to your mattress. That is gross! In comes this mattress cover that has a terry top but is waterproof underneath preventing any moisture or dust mites getting through. The sides are stretchy enabling you to easily get them over your mattress edges.

Sleep surface material - 100% cotton terry
Side material - 100% polyester knit
Lining - 100% polyurethane

IMPORTANT to note that this mattress cover does NOT cover the bottom of your mattress. No, the listing does not say that either but I know there are some folks who would prefer a cover that actually seals their mattress. This one does not do that nor for the price would you expect it to!

Practical, well fitting cover. Product provided in exchange for an honest review. Thanks, Liz",1

"As soon as I receive these headphones I could tell by the packaging that these were going to be my new favorite thing. I've always been a sucker for smooth and Sleek packaging, and this one did not let me down. As a mother of two teenagers off and find myself searching for a pair of headphones to have not been commandeered yet, or are actually still working. So I took it upon myself to label these as my own. They are super easy to put on and very easy to pair with your phone. I have a Motorola Droid Maxx and it paid immediately with my phone and I was able to listen to all my music that I have stored on my phone. The sound quality of these headphones is excellent and has really good bass and volume control. I have smaller ears than normal and I find that I have a hard time finding headphones that fit comfortably, they are either way too big or way too small they fall off my head or they won't go all the way around. These however, fit perfectly, which is a wonderful thing for me. My husband has a Motorola phone as well, I'm not sure what type it is, however but he was able to pair with his as well. My daughter has an iPhone 5s and she was able to pair with her phone quickly and easily as well. Overall I think this was a great purchase and I'm very pleased with the product. It is very well made and stores away easily. I would recommend this to my friends and family.

"Brilliance comes in many forms. This dual universal cable is saving summer. We love a good road trip, but not the sound of the kiddos devices blaring as they try to drown out the sound of the others'. So this cord works well for us to plug in up front (where we control it) and allows each child to plug in their headphones. So they can watch the same movie--or they can opt out without disturbing the other. I also enjoy late night's in bed with my husband listening to a podcast. Prior to this cord we were forced to each have one ear bud. Now we can both listen to the same podcast (in stereo (both ears)) and not disturb the kiddos. It's perfect.

"It is somewhat hard to write a review for this product; they're SOCKS for crying out loud! How in-depth can one be? I will use all my brainpower to give you the most information about these stitched pieces of cotton that I possibly can. For one, they are thin. This can be a positive or a negative depending on who you are. I find that thinner socks can get holes fairly quickly when walking around the house. So far, this has held up for the past two weeks but I worry about how long they will last into the future. Second, they are very soft and the socks do not slide down the ankle. I have been wearing them to work for the past 2 weeks to test them out and have had no problems. I am a size 10 and they fit perfectly. I gave a pair to my friend to see how well they would fit him. He is a size 11 and he has given me no complaints. My only real gripe is that they only come in white. There's nothing less attractive to the opposite sex than when you cross your legs at the dinner table and reveal your sparkling white socks to the whole restaurant. But if you still wear white socks on dates, you have bigger problems. I have gotten off track haven't I? Oh right, the socks! Yes, they are a good product and I would recommend them as a good casual crew sock to go along with sneakers. They may not be the best for winter months or any kind of boots due to their thinness, but they hold up well and are comfy. What more could you ask for?

  These chilling soapstones are ideal for the serious whiskey drinker  they don't dilute your drink while keeping it cold. Soapstone is soft and these have rounded corners, so will not scratch your glasses, and it gets super cold and stays cold at least as long as an ice cube. There are nine stones in the set  about  cubes  one or two will keep a finger or two of whiskey chilled perfectly. Rinse them off after use and put back in the freezer for the next time!

"I got these sandals because I think they are unique. I have looked for similar sandal boots and couldn't find anything nearly as cute and innovative as these. And from the moment I received these I fell in love.
I think it's fair to say that these are sandal boots that are probably best for early autumn or late spring. In the summer, like right now, my feet will get very hot, despite the holes. But seriously, these are very cute!
I ordered half a size up from my normal size because my normal size would have taken three weeks longer to ship, so these are a little too big, if I wear them without socks. But, because they are not as soft as they look in the picture (the material is very strong and quite stiff) I would recommend wearing them with hidden socks. (The ones that just cover your toes and heels).
When I wear these, I get compliments every single time. Perhaps because you can't buy them in a store and perhaps because they go well with whatever your wear.
It takes a little while until these feel really comfortable, because as I mentioned, the material starts out rather stiff and doesn't wrap around the foot too easily at first. I sprayed them with what I call a ""fitting spray"" which is a spray that you usually spray in leather boots to make them a little more fitting. I also treated them with a water and stain repellant which keeps these bright colored for a long time.

After wearing these a few times they become a lot more comfortable, so don't give up on these too easily.

"Great light weight and durable pant. The material slides easily, if sitting on a material like vinyl ( on my riding mower on the side of a hill it is hard to stay in the seat). Has plenty of pockets and the color has not faded after many washings. I will buy again.",0

I will definitely buy again. And they look awesome!!

"Really awesome backpack and the Customer Service is great! I was frustrated when I originally got this because it had a tear. They immediately sent me a new one.
The pack is great for traveling, folds up into its own case so I can easily put in a suit case. It's big enough to lug all my stuff.",0
"When we first got our growler we never even noticed that there wasn't a great handle to carry it when full. While we had been using the loop that attached the lid to the bottle it wasn't always the best way to carry it. This carry strap (it came in a 2 pack!) solves all of those issues. It is nice and thick, has a secure fit and carries full bottles easily. It was a little tricky getting it completely on the first time but I don't think it will come off easily as well. It also snaps open and shut easily via a buckle so you can easily open the lid to drink/pour.  This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1
"This is a very nice quality memory foam mattress topper. I chose the one that fits a twin bed for my son. It lies on the mattress perfectly and the  sheets fit snuggly over it--no forcing them on.  He seems to be extremely pleased with it. His mattress was a bit too firm and his topper has made a he difference in his sleep quality. I no longer hear him tossing and turning all night. Plus, his little feline body seems to like it, as well! Oh, yeah. It says ""made in America."" That's a rarity, lately.

"These are nice.  I really like the argyle. After 3 or 4 washing's a little bit of pilling is showing.  The ones from the guys in Maine are a bit thicker (more wool?) (and more expensive), but they are plain.  All in all these fit well, look good and do the job.

Update:  After wearing these over the course of 5 months (2 or 3 times a month) the expreso socks are piling along  the diagonal lines. The other two pair (black and grey) get more wear and don't have this problem.",0
"I purchased this a little uneasy because of the low price tag. I wasn't sure how reliable it would be holding up our smart tv at that price when most wall mounts in a store run $100 or more. It is great! It holds the tv very well, and the tilt is adjustable. We even ordered a second for the living room!",0

"Very good! Very Solid! Holds my Nikon D300 with out issue. I have a old tripod with the old school camcorder style adjusters. It was out of wack and would not level, it would not tighten down. I ordered this and a thread adapter and love it. The tripod is still great, it got to be 30+ yrs old and rugged. Now it has a head to go along with it. A quick turn of the nobs and you can spin your camera in any direction. Once you lock it down it holds my camera steady and true.

Very happy with this, it has brought new life to a solid old tripod.

"These are beautiful and great covers and come in 3 separate color combinations. The one I got has the starburst in aqua with a pretty pink back showing through. It is the same pink as the photo above. The second one is turquoise like above with pink showing through and the 3rd is a very dark pink with off white. These come in 2 pieces, the first very soft and then the back is harder. The raised rubber edges front and back protect your phone but I still use tempered glass on top. There are precise cutout for speakers, camera, charging and audio ports and a cutout on the back for the iPhone logo. The buttons are very easy to press. I've received this items free. I've reviewed it of my own free will to the best of my ability with the same objectivity I apply to items purchased at full price. I think 3 for the price of 11 apiece is a great deal.",1

"The Mobility, hard case cover for MacBook Pro 15.4 is a wonderful case. It is easy to attach to your MacBook, comes in two parts the top and bottom. The bottom part has vents and four foot pads. The plastic is good quality too. It has a soft feel yet it is easy to grip. It comes in a variety of color and love my mint green color. I would high recommend purchasing this cover for peace of mind that you will not scratch up your MacBook.

"I ordered this to wear on a cruise, and I still plan on wearing it. However, the romper does run small. I'm a size 0 and I wear a size small in shirts. I ordered a small, and this romper was SNUG and a little too tight in the crotch area. The material also isn't as cotton-y as expected. It's more of a polyester blend. Overall, I likely wouldn't purchase this again if give the chance.

"I was really excited to receive this product. I had previously purchased a cheap waterproof bluetooth speaker that suction-cupped to the shower wall which died very quickly. So getting this definitely seemed like a step-up for me.

Upon arrival, I tried it out immediately and it worked great; I was so happy. On day 2, the bluetooth connection no longer worked and I was forced to use the AUX cable that came with it in order to play music through it. Day 8, the speakers slowly lost sound quality. This seems like it has the potential to be a great speaker, but it falls short, unfortunately.

I would like to mention that I did never once place this in or near water. It was always kept on the opposite side of my bathroom as I showered. I also never dropped it or damaged it in any way, so I'm not sure what caused it to stop working well.

I could have received a faulty speaker, or it could just be poor quality.

"This swimsuit is very cute and well made. I like the orange and navy color, and my husband says the suit is flattering.
It would be more flattering if the sizing was more true to size. It seems that most swimsuits are made in China and they don't seem able to get the sizing correct.
I love the top of this swimsuit. It came with those padded cup liners, but I took those out and threw them away. They are always way too small for me.  This swimsuit does not have an underwire, but it supports me very well. It has spaghetti straps underneath the thick top straps that hold everything in place. The rouching also holds the tummy in.
I don't like the bottoms very much. In the picture on the listing they look like boy shorts. What I received looks more like traditional bikini cut. They are a little small, but thankfully the top covers them most of the time.
If the bottoms looked more like the photo and the sizing was better, this would be 5 stars. As is, it's still a decent suit. The top is better made than some of the way more expensive suits I've tried on.

"I purchased the Morryoddy Women's Tankini One Piece Swimsuit because I prefer the swimsuits with skirts to cover up the problem areas and this was very reasonably priced and it has a very bright and pretty color. The fabric has a soft, sexy feel and it is also very stretchy. I am a size 10 and I ordered the large and it fit very well on my figure. I love that it is figure flattering yet modest enough to not have everything hanging out to look good in it. The skirt part on it is long enough to not have to wear something over it, it looks like a very short sundress. I also like the padded bra in it, I have small breasts due to having lumpectomies in both breasts and it actually looks like I have some cleavage and also helps to even out the unevenness of the size of them. But if you don't need the padding you can always take it out. I love everything about this swimsuit and am very happy to have found it!!

We love this grill brush! The bristles are very sturdy and do not bend or flatten when you scrape your grill bars. This grill brush is nice and wide and covers a large area. The stiff bristles make cleaning the grill a breeze. I rinse it with water when I am done and I like to give b it a shake outside to remove excess water before hanging it back up. This grill brush is better than the named brand ones I have purchased in the past for double the price! I would reccomend and will be buying this again in the future!

"GEARONIC TM Travel Trip Passport Credit ID Card Cash Organizer Wallet Purse Holder Case Document Bag is fantastic for traveling, or just to have for road trips. I like to take mini weekend vacations and this Wallet is perfect for that! It is made of 100% nylon material. It's not itchy or uncomfortable to have in your hand or even inside a travel bag, or purse. You can feel the little stitching if you run your fingers along it. The inside has 9 pockets and 1 outside pocket. The 9 inside pockets are crossed and similar to a wallet pocket. Including a zipper pocket on the inside. The inside is see through so when you put stuff in it, you can see where you put what. The outside pocket is not zippered. It is just an open pocket. This Wallet is really great to keep organization for all your items, and if your not using it for travel, it's still a very nice wallet for everyday use. Geronic offers 7 different colors, however I just received the black one. It felt the most compatible with anything I might carry with me. I've used this product for my review items as well as for my work case. Such as putting my markers, screwdriver, envelope opener, and work badge, money for concessions. So this Travel Passport organizer wallet is very versatile.

"Let me first start this review out by letting you know; I have a problem. I have a problem where I buy headphones far too often, in search of some hidden gem or artifactual in-ear headphone that is the perfect price and has the perfect sound quality.

Unfortunately, this headphone has neither. To be fair, these are probably 3 star head phones, because I subtracted 1 more star for the price, as the quality you get from them is equivalent to some headphones in the $15-$19 range.

That all being said, these are still pretty great headphones. If you are looking for pretty good highs, reasonable mids, and balanced lows, then these are a reasonable price and definitely get a bonus for the quality wood and stylish design.

I did receive this pair of headphones at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. P.S. I have attached a picture showing that I have a problem, I probably need help.

Okay, just kidding, I've changed the total stars to 4 up from 3, these have an impressive noise-cancellation. I can't hear my co-workers talking to eachother as i'm writing this review. They're only 3 feet away from me.",1

"This is a beautifully USA made dog collar. I like the colors, design, and it looks good.  The fabric is thick, seems to be good quality, and seems durable.  The tag-a-long piece seems like a smart piece of the collar.  The ring to attach a lease is strong and large so that it is easy to attach leases to it, by this may appear too large on smaller dogs; so some this could be a negative but for most this will be a positive thing.

PROS
- Good Quality
- Nice Design
- Appears to be very Durability
- Good Color
- Lease ring is large and easy to attach a lease to it

CONS:
- The piece the holds the two collar fabrics together when you shorten the length is loose, my personal preference would be to have this piece tighter to hold the fabrics in place more.
- Lease ring is very large and may appear too large on smaller dogs

In summary, this is a good collar at a good price and its a bonus that it is USA made.  Id recommend this collar to friends.

"This is a pretty easy to use, very user friendly and very functional and effective bike light.

Set up is easy, even for me.  You get the light, a holder, a charge cord and the remote with strap and the bracket for the light.

Thread the strap thru the remote and strap it onto our bike handbars.  For the light itself, slide into the holder and then mount it to the bar under your seat on your bike facing the traffic behind you.  Thats it.. pretty simple and easy to use.  To  activate the light, depress the remote in the direction you are turning, you have left, right etc. There are 4 kinds of flashing modes :Constant light mode,slow-flash mode,quick-flash mode, and scroller mode...and not only does act as a turn signal.. you also get a loud noise that emits out of it when you use the turn signals.

If the light gets dim, just recharge it with the included usb charger cord.

Works well..  goes on your bike easily.  Unfortunately for me after several bike rides, I was removing it from where I had it mounted because I have a bike bag that interferes with the view of the light, so while fooling around with it and trying to re-position it, I managed to break the little bracket holder that the light slides into, this is not the fault of the light and equipment but my own inabilities in trying to re-position it, but I included it in the review as a caution and to be careful if your twisting or tugging on it.  I am actually thinking of securing it on the back of reflective vest that I wear when I ride.

"My husband does allot of labor work and fixes everything in our home. I have long hair and its always clogging up our drains. He just cleaned the drains like a week before I received this product so I wish I got it earlier but it did arrive on time. It is small enough to slide into the drain and I love the length of it as its really long. It is easy to push the claw out as it works like a baby bulb suction. You press down on the spring and release to push the claw out as you retract the metal tube. Its a great quick fix diy tool.

"We bought an Amazon Echo last Christmas 2015 along with the Wink Controller and over $100 worth of TCP Connected bulbs.  They worked mostly fine until July 1st.  Now they no longer work with Amazon Echo or Wink.  You can control them with an app, but only inside of the house.  That is NOT helpful.  I can flip a light switch if I'm inside of the house.  I certainly don't want to pull up an app on my phone to turn on the light in the bathroom.  The purpose of getting these is so that the house would not be dark when we got home at night and to have the ability to program the lights while we are away.  I called the company this morning and was told that they sent out a notice ???? in May and were not longer supported by Wink or Echo.  After only 7 months of using $16 to $25 each for light bulbs totaling over $100, they are USELESS.  TCP did not offer any discount, rebate, opportunity to return, etc.  WHAT A RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!",0

"Cant be unhappy about anythingI got exactly what I thought I was paying for. The biggest misconception here seems to be that this is some kind of splitter. The top reviews make this very clear, but just to drive the point home: This product is just a way of increasing the number of HDMI input ports in your TV. This product just makes it so that IF your TV only has a single HDMI port, you don't have to unplug the Chrome Cast and plug in a Wii U to play Mario Kart, then unplug the Wii U and plug in the adapter to watch a movie from your laptop. With this, you eliminate the need to plug/unplug, and you can easily switch between the things that require HDMI inputs with a simple click of the button on the product. The automatic switch function seems to have varying success for whatever reason according to the reviews here but I had no problem with it!

Generally, a great product for the price and definitely adds to convenience. I do wish it were a little longer, but that just depends on the arrangement of your TV and such!

"I have never used or owned one of these before.  It is extremely powerful and I would recommend from experience that you point it away from your face when turning it on.  It's Bright!  I was able to see in bright daylight while walking around my house all the dust and white dog hairs and stains on everything in my house.  At night it will light up a whole room like a blacklight.  I didn't go looking for scorpions, although I want to, but this makes anything that's white glow like the sun when you shine it on it, so I can only imagine you would have no problems picking them out.

The build quality is better than I would expect for the price, there are orings on the most of the threaded sections, you can disassemble the entire flashlight.  There is no heat sink on the led's but after I had this on and off for an hour walking around my house it was not even warm to the touch.  Also, BONUS it comes with 3 batteries, all you have to do is screw off the bottom cap and pull out the 2 little white plastic discs from between the spring and the battery pack.

"I was very pleased to see how high quality the material on this is. I have loved having it. So far, the thing I use it most often for is cleaning out the dust and nastiness in my computer keyboards. It is great because you can direct high pressure to specific areas.

The pressure sensitivity knob works well for making minor adjustments in pressure; you can also do that however by just no pressing the handle down all the way.

This blow gun is a lifesaver when it comes to cleaning small areas that my regular air nozzle simply is to large to get to. I like the extended length on the nozzle on this.

"For me, this cushion was just okay. I get low back pain and the occasional sciatic pain from time to time. I was experiencing a back pain episode when I ordered this cushion.

What I Liked:
- No slip grip. Helped keep the cushion from sliding around in my office chair, which is made of a smooth material.
- It fit. I have a large office chair, and the fit was just fine for me.
- Definitely helped me sit up straighter, but I'm not sure if that's directly attributed to the cushion, or just my subconscious knowledge that it was there. Either way, I wasn't slouching as much.
- It did help my back pain.

What Was Just OK:
- I wasn't too sure on how to use it right out the box, I think fit and position can vary from person to person. It did not feel great when I sat on it with the cushion pushed all the way back against the seat. I moved it forward to where it met the edge of my seat and it was so much more comfortable that way -- but that may be attributed to how my body is built/shaped.
- It wasn't as firm or thick as I imagined it would be. After a few minutes sitting on it, it becomes pretty flat. You still have some support just because of the material being there, I just wish it was thicker or more firm.

Overall, decent cushion. I will definitely keep it in my office because it did seem to help. This is just a product that has to be used over a long period of time to be sure.

"This set of storage lids are wonderful, I've had them less than 24 hours and after washing them already have them in use.
*They interlock within each other for easy storage but also have a hole that will make them possible to hang from my pot rack.
*The small one us easily usable on cans such as ca food for short term storage, while the larger one is is perfect for larger mixing bowels (without spouts) or even medium size skillets

I was able to suspend a 5 oz can of cat food in the air after suctioning the lid to the can, seem like a great way for air tight storage, but is easily removable when your ready to use what in the container.

"I think this is so awesome! My 2-year old daughter goes everywhere with me and the Bento Box is the perfect size for our outings to the park, zoo and just normal trips to the store. Every time I've taken it anywhere, people ask me about it. Maybe it's the cool design or sleek, metal look it has, but people love it!

My favorite things about it is that it's so eco friendly, but still looks cool. The handle is great! It's easy to grab and carry, but lays flat so it can easily go into a backpack or bag without catching on other items. The 3 containers easily snap together to keep food separate, but easily accessible. We absolutely love the Bento Box and use it all the time!

"I like these.  A size chart would have been a fantastic addition to the advertisement, but what I received definitely met my expectations, even though they were a bit larger than I had hoped for.  The upper is a thinner neoprene, and the bottom is a solid rubber that provides a grip with a dot type texture.  Unlike most of the swim shoes I've had in the past, these are actually very comfortable and flexible, with a pretty good sole.  I was able to wear them on sand and rocky riverbeds, keep my footing, and not get gored by sticks and trash underwater.  They are also not as tight as most others I have purchased in the past, and actually fit a wide foot very comfortably.  The seam between the upper and the sole is pretty secure as well, and I wasn't able to pull it apart.  The only thing that prevents a 5 star rating is the sizing, which is S, M, L, etc.  I ordered the medium and wear a shoe size of 7.5 to 8, and these are a bit on the large side.  Hopefully, a sizing chart will be included soon.  I did receive a discount on my first order in exchange for testing and providing an honest review for the Amazon community.",1
"The G43 is a small pistol and this grip tape does not change that, I'd like to see them make a tape that would add some girth to the grip. It will enable you to hang on a little better. Installation is real easy but you will need your own supply of rubbing alcohol. It doesn't come with enough.",0

"This is a great, thick mat and it dries quickly. In my opinion, the color is a little bit brighter than the picture (but all screens can be different) and it shows every bit of dirt.

"This is great for anyone who ever cooks meat. I know that sounds stupid but this wouldn't help a vegan. The entire back is magnetic and sticks great to the stove, fridge, or any other metal surface. I'm not sure if putting it on the grill would work because of the heat though. This has all you need to know about cooking meats to the right temperature. It has beef, lamb, venison, chops, roasts, pork, veal steaks, hams, fish, chicken, turkey, casseroles, and more. My favorite is the pre-cooked and leftovers. It has ( I believe ) every option for doneness, the temperatures for them all and cooking and serving recommendations. One of the worst things is getting a meat that isn't done the way we like. And if it's undercooked that could be fatal. This is a wonderful product that is very handy. Even if you ""know your stuff"" it's still a nice reminder just in case. I highly recommend this product

"I really wish it had the silver buttons on the side that the regular S7 case has. The S7 edge cases have black rubber buttons, which look cheap and are also very difficult to press down. Obliq, is there any way you could send me an S7 edge espresso colored case that has the chrome-looking buttons on the side for Power & Volume? It could be an exchange or you could just send me one for an honest review, free of charge. :D After all, I read many recent reviews on here that stated the buttons were ""silver"" so I was mislead by those into thinking they were. They are not, though. Again, I really wanted to have this same case but with the silver/chrome buttons.

Thanks for an otherwise great looking case. It's going to match my car's espresso leather steering wheel :)",1
"I just bought a Brita Pacifica 10-cup pitcher.  Let me tell you, I am impressed!  First off, this is the first filter I have ever bought!  What took me so long?  I used to drink bottled water at work.  Since I am retired now, I have been drinking tap water.  But I really don't like the chlorine taste. Probably other 'stuff' in the water as well!

Even before the first use, I noticed that quality materials are used in construction.  Everything fits 'tightly'.  It is BPA free.  I can't believe how good the water tastes!  This is my TAP WATER!

I highly recommend the Brita pitcher-style filters!",1

"I took this bag down 30 miles of the shenedoah river. It held my electronics, book, and anything I didn't want to get wet. This bag preformed flawlessly. We hit a little bit of class 2 rapids and our canoe took on a bit of water. Everything in this bag stayed dry. The little phone pouch was great too because it allowed me to take pictures without worrying too much about my phone being dropped in the water. There is a lanyard on it, so I hung it on my neck for the entire race and was able to capture some great pictures along the way. It came especially in handy when my buddy nearly flipped our boat trying to get out and launched me off the side. Everything stayed dry.

"The sleeper is very cute and of good quality. It was honestly even cuter than I thought it would be, and the packaging is top notch. Be aware that Papillou sizing runs a little differently and you should order one size up. For instance, my baby just moved into 6-9 month clothing and I wanted something that she could grow into. I tried ordering a 6-12 month sleeper, but based on their sizing system, what I wanted was their 12-18 month sleeper. I did not know this before ordering, but Papillou's customer service when addressing this was quick and responsive and highly satisfactory. I will definitely order from them again.",0
"I received this as a free review sample. I have direct experience with this type of light because I actually have a half dozen of various brands (and sizes) installed around my house. This one is a newer generation and is much brighter than some of the older ones I own (a few are over two years old.)

This one has a larger photovoltaic cell array and an impressive internal battery that stores a whopping 2200mAh. The outer housing is about the same as the older technology lights, but, again, I have some that are over two years old with similar form factors and they have survived seasonal and weather cycles, so I have confidence that these are just as sturdy.

If I had one wish it would be a way to tell just how much these lights are charged. Mine are installed on the south east side of my house, so they are getting a lot of sunlight. However, I have not had them long enough to get a sense of how they will charge during shorter winter days. Also, I have mine installed in a low traffic area, so it may not much matter. I will say that if these are your first solar lights, location is everything (regardless of which brand you end up purchasing.) Also, make sure that there are no obstructions between the photovoltaic arrays and sunlight, and they includes eaves and gutters.

Bottom line: these lights are as good as any that I have used, and definitely better than those from two years back. The two distinguishing features of these - if you are comparison shopping - are bright LEDs and large internal batteries (with a photovoltaic cell array to match.)",1

"You receive a generous amount of oven liner. Enough to line several appliances or share with your friends. This only catches the food which falls down in your oven, so it does not, as it claims, prevent you from ever having to clean your oven again, you will still have to clean the door and sides.

I placed cut this to size and placed on a wire rack set to the lowest possible setting in my oven, as I have a gas oven and the instructions say not to put it directly on the bottom. It cuts easily with a regular pair of scissors. It does not seem to interfere with the cooking temperature of the food. After using a few times, it does seem to give off a slight odor. This combined with the warning on the package about birds and this product does worry me and I am undecided if we will continue to use this as intended.

"I served in the Navy for 20 years. This is a treat for phone case with the Navy logo and the actual camouflage design for the back plate. This is an accurate design to demonstrate the quality done to give some pleasure those who served. Please be aware that this is a case for the Galaxy S7 Active phone. It is the new phone Samsung is rumored to be in the works to release soon. Therefore this will not fit your current S7. I'm reviewing this strictly on the quality of this case but would not make any assumptions as to the fit since the phone is not released yet. With that said, The combination of rubber and plastic is noticeable where the rubber is fairly flexible and supported by the plastic casing. The feel good around the edges and does not feel slippery despite the smooth plastic frame.
OVERALL: This will probably a one of the few cases available when the new S7 Active be released. It will probably the only case that would have the Navy design which I think is a smart idea. Maybe it would be of interest to do all military services. Who knows, they may just make it an official case for what it stands for.

"Great product !!  Purchased in Dec 2014 and it works as advertised.  Great for turning on/off Christmas tree lights, electronics, and other products which are hard to reach or don't have an actual power-off state.  The two improvements I would suggest are:
 - having 10 unique units -- I need 7 in one room so 5 is better than nothing but .........
 - each wall unit should have an identifying number as I occasionally forget which wall unit is paired with which remote button
  ( I stuck a label on each to resolve this issue but this should be part of the manufacturing process)

"Please note that my review is strictly based on testing several of these security cameras if not more. I respect anyone's opinions posted but please do understand that receiving an item for free doesn't take away from my unbiased review. I have been testing the system for about a week and here is my detailed review:

This is a first class 4 channel security system. It comes with 4 cameras that can record in 720P video in color during the day and in B/W during the night using excellent night vision capability. The cameras are made of aluminum that is very high quality. Although the title is listed as ok for use in outdoors, this is NOT a water-resistant camera set. You would need to waterproof it yourself. Then again the cables and wiring would make it even harder to do unless you really try to wrap it hard and seal it well. It is even mentioned on the very limited 2 page manual provided.

The one I received included a 1 TB hard drive which is solid to say the least. The casing includes 2 USB ports which one is used for an optical mouse (included in the package) and a spare USB port. There are 4 ports which are for connecting the 4 cameras. There are 2 really long cables and 2 shorter cables included as well. I kind of wish they were all the same length. It would have made life a lot easier. The last and only port left is the VGA connection. This is perhaps the biggest downfall along with a few other minor things I will be mentioning.

During this time when everyone is upgrading from HD to UHD, the VGA connection is really outdated and perhaps only really ok for an older monitor use. You won't be able to use this on a newer TV unless it supports a VGA connection. The next big problem is the use of MeShare which has now been replaced by Zsight. It can be glitchy at times but it has certainly gotten better over the past year. Don't expect it to work perfectly for remote viewing. This package is primarily for local usage. If you are more interested in a cloud based camera then you should check out the Zmodo Pivot which I also recently reviewed.

Now there are plenty of reviews here mentioning what the capabilities of this camera are so I won't be getting in to that as much but I would like to talk about who this system is good for. If you are a business owner and have a mid range to a small office/store or any indoor space which would allow you to hide the cables, this is a great buy. The local hard drive will be recording around the hour and you would have no worries. If you are looking to install this in your house, then I would look at other newer wireless products from Zmodo. They make a great amount of security systems.

None of the these systems are perfect and they are not always reliable but for the most part, it does a good job. In my book this is a 3.5/5 and for the price point, I am rounding it up to 4/5 considering a single nest camera costs over half as much as this. I can recommend this product based on everything I have explained. There are a few cons but thats with every system.

"Our precious 12.5 year old weimaraner Koufax has had some serious health issues. There have been a few times we thought he was in his last days or months. A friend told me about this dog food and after reading their website, I decided to give it a try. On May 23, 2016, I started feeding Koufax Gentle Giants Dog Food. The effects were literally immediate. I am not kidding. He ran into the house and seem to have a smile on his face. Since then, his mood has become more playful, he doesn't seem as depressed, his coat looks shinier and he seems happier. This is the only change I have made and I am giving this food all the credit and rating it an A+. A huge bonus is it is cheaper than the ""quality"" dog food I was feeding him before. I order it on Amazon with free shipping if you are a prime member. There website says they sell it in some grocery stores, although I haven't verified this yet.",0

I was offered this lunch box in exchange for my honest review. This doesn't ever guarantee a positive review as I rely on reviews before I make purchases like everyone else. My daughter was over the moon excited when I handed her her lunch packed in this beautiful lunch bag. The colors are very bright and the artwork is beautiful. In my opinion it is bigger than it looks in the picture but not too big or bulky at all. The material is thick so it insulates well. I usually send a cold bottle of water and a frozen gogurt in my kids lunches along with fruit and chips and sandwich but I use the gogurt and water bottle as an Ice pack to keep everything cold and come lunch time the gogurt it thawed out and ready to eat. My daughter said at lunch 6 hours after I packed her lunch the gogurt was still frozen in the center. If they come out with more designs I'll definitely purchase more. Good quality product!,1

"So ladies, if you ever want to give your significant other a nice present and you ask which type of iPhone they have, be sure to ask twice! I'm just glad I have the proof on my cellphone or it would be word against word  ;-). So to share all, he said he had an iPhone 6plus but obviously he has an iPhone 6s. Maybe it was just wishful thinking on his part at the time, his 6s is like taking it up against Goliath really, it's that much difference in size. For your info an iPhone 6plus phone case measures 15,5 cm in length and 7,5 cm in width.
Anyway let's move on, so I received a very nice box with the Shieldon logo on it.. he had no idea what to expect and when he opened it, he still didn't know because the high quality iPhone case was wrapped in a soft fabric envelope. Unwrapping that, it revealed the delicately packaged iphone cover case made of 100% real leather. There was even a little tag on it, a little reminder of the authenticity of the leather.
The case has a magnetic clip which makes it easy to keep everything inside secure but the clip can even be flipped and magnetically secured to the back so there's nothing flapping around while you are on the phone calling (you can call with the case closed too but I think that looks weird) or when you need to text. So I can agree that this case will protect your phone adequately, but it has few additional perks too that not all other phone cases have. It can also easily take up to 3 cards into each of the three slots on the left side, so that's 9 cards while still looking just as slim, and there is also another compartment behind them where you can easily tuck away some folded bills. In a way it can carry most of what you need in a day so that makes it a great iPhone case. Finally, it includes a stand feature that is easy to set and manipulate, so you can put your phone also in a horizontal position. Overall, I like the classy look and luxurious feel of this phone case. Too bad he won't be able to enjoy any of it ;-).

"I wanted to believe the reviews written here about these headphones even though I noted that most were reviewed by people who received this product free or at a discount. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount also for my honest and unbiased review and here it is. I hope it help you in buying decision.
First off the color is a fire engine red and shouts look at me. If you want attention then this is the headset for you. I cant complain about the color because I knew they would be bright but the picture shows then with a slight orange hue which they do not have. When I ordered the headset the black and white color were not an option.
Sound quality: They do have good tonal range but not great. The bass is muddle and the highs and mid-range are just ok.  If you are planning on listening to music in any format other than MP3s look elsewhere for you will be sadly disappointed with these.  This headset does not sound as good as the Kinivo BTH240, which I use daily.  For clarification my reference headphone for sound quality is the Grado SR225e which also own. This is not the best headset made (the Grado) but in my humble opinion is the best sounding headset for the money. But they are not Bluetooth capable. I only mention these headsets just to give you my reference points.  Back to the review  The sound quality of these headphones suit me just fine for my intended use and the only reason for the 3 star rating. I only wanted them to listen to audio books and watch TV at night. And for that purpose they sound very good.  If it wasn't for this I would have rated them 1 star.
Fit: Now we get to the reason they only get a three star rating. The Headset are the most uncomfortable I have ever worn. I cannot wear them more the 20 minutes at a time without my ears acing from the pressure. I tried everything to make them fit better nothing worked, the head band has limited adjustments and the padding on the ear cups is none existent. I added some foam padding but that just muddle the sound to an unacceptable level. If the comfort level could be fixed I could recommend these headsets but as is I cannot so my recommendation is look elsewhere for your listening pleasure.
Clarification I wear a size 7 hat and these headphones may work better for a person with a smaller head but I don't think so. I had my wife try them she wears a mans size 5 hat.  And they were too big for her and she also complained about the comfort.

Edit 6/1/16
I am doing this edit of my review because of the attack on my integrity I received form the COE of the company. First let me offer this clarification: I do not give 5 star reviews for products unless they earn it.
I have complained in the past about professional reviewers and I never wanted to become one but I was signed up to review products at a discount and I am glad I was because there are a lot of reviews on amazon that make a product sound great and go in to lengthy detail about its merits. I have purchased some of these products based on these reviews and have been sadly disappointed. So I strive in my reviews to get right to the meat of the product is it worth buying or not

Now for my edited review: The product I received had a poor fit and was very uncomfortable for me to wear and this is the only reason for the 3 star rating. This is a headphone if you cant wear them why would you purchase them. I did not take off any points of sound quality because I don't expect Bluetooth headphones to have audiophile quality that would be unrealistic.  I also took no points off for color just stated they were much brighter than expected. Therefore I cannot give the product I received a higher rating because they were unusable for me. I had no choice but to return them.  Maybe I got a defective pair maybe they were not designed for someone with larger ears. I do believe my ears are of average size. So one possibility based on previous reviews of the product is maybe I got a detective pair but I cant really address that without having another pair to compare those to.  I will not take the chance on purchasing another pair at my expense base on the assumption they may have had a defect. If they were not defective I hope the company uses this as an opportunity to address the issue because they could be a 4 or 5 star product if the fit and comfort level was better.  If the CEO of the company feels I did him a disservice by my honest review I am sorry. If he thinks I got a defective headset I will make him this offer. If he would like to send me a pair for evaluation purposes I would be glad to review them again. Thanks for reading and I hope this give readers of my reviews some insight of my integrity.",1

"When we travel, we hire pet sitters to come and take care of our dogs.  I thought this clock would be an easy way to see how things went while we were away, and keep an eye on things.  I love how discreet it is. It really looks like a sleek, modern clock.  We have it sitting on a bookshelf, and it doesn't stand out at all.  No one has ever said anything about it, or asked about it.

I am only giving this 4 stars because I feel like there is room for improvement.  I love the logistics behind it, but in person, It took some trial and error to get this set up and working.  The instructions could be written better, and there were a lot of steps involved.  Luckily, my husband is good at gadgets and electronics, so he has spent some time getting this set up and going.  Honestly, we haven't figured out all the modes yet, but we will keep trying.

Overall, it's a great idea, and looks nice.  It will take some patience to get it going.  I think with better instructions, it would be more user friendly.  This product was provided for an honest evaluation. I hope it has been helpful.",1

"I am so glad I tried Koodella Self-Cleaning Cat & Dog Brush. I have to say it is outstanding!!! I am amazed at how well it works. My dog, Chico has terrible allergies so he has to have special food, soap free shampoos and needs to be brushed everyday. So , needless to say, it is very important to me and Chico how well a brush works. Other brushes I have tried work ok but don't seem to get a lot of his loose hair. More hair hits the floor than actually ends up in the brush. They are terrible to try to clean and you can never get all of the hair out of them. I can't believe how well the Koodella Self-Cleaning Cat & Dog Brush worked. It is unbelievable how much hair came off of Chico. I emptied the hair off of it 10 times in just a few minutes. It is so easy to clean too. All you have to do is push a button and then wipe the hair off. Every hair comes off of it, which I love. Chico loves it so much that whenever he sees me pick it up he will follow me everywhere I go. He wants brushed all the time. I would have to say that it is the best dog brush I have ever used!

"This safety set is an amazing deal.  My husband is required to wear eye and ear protection at work.  We usually buy whatever we can find and this time we found ""Active Research Earmuffs & Hearing Protection Bundle - Strongest Available 34dB Protection For Shooting And Industrial Use - Includes Earplugs And Safety Glasses - ANSI S3.19 Tested Certified""  The fact that you receive 3 items- earmuffs, earplugs and safety glasses make this a bargain.  The earmuffs are what matter the most to us.  They are very heavy duty.  The earpiece swivel is thick and sturdy.  The wire that holds the frame is also very heavy duty and much sturdier than others we have purchased in the past.  The earplugs are a great bonus for added hearing protection with the earmuffs or for separate use on their own.  The glasses are great too. They are clear plastic all the way around.  My husband prefers the tinted ones, but needs a set of clear ones as well for the dark rainy mornings.
Overall, we are extremely pleased with all aspects of this purchase.  The quality is outstanding and the fact that it includes all the pieces he needs in one box for such a great price make these one of the best sets and best deals I've seen.  When the need arises, which it will, although not as soon as it has in the past, we will be purchasing this set again.

"I thought I would try another pair of bluetooth headphones as I have been looking for a less expensive pair that still have good quality and sound. When I go these headphones in I noticed they came in a very nice box and they were packaged well. I was blown away that they came with so many extra earbuds and ear clips. They also came with a charger, a very very nice case to hold the headphones in and the instructions. These headphones are very light even though they don't look like they would be. Connecting these was very easy as you just push and hold down the power button for 3-4 seconds until you see the light led start blinking. You then turn on your bluetooth and search for the headphones and choose I think its QY19 and that's it. I always recommend using the largest earbuds you get as they give the most bass and are designed to do that. These also have a really nice volume/pause/play/power control center on your headphone cable that is really easy to get to. Once I was connected and had my earbuds setup I took a listen. At first I noticed they sounded really good with high crisps and great mids but lacked bass then again these aren't bass heavy earbuds like my Powerbeats. What I did was turn on bass extender on my iphone 6 plus eq and that did the trick. That made these headphones sound really good. Next I took a call with these headphones and the call was very clear and easy to use. I was told I could be heard great as well with no issues whatsoever !! As I was using these I was walking around my house and forgot I had on bluetooth headphones and it wasn't till I was pretty close to 30 ft away that they started to go out so that is really good. Also, they came pretty much pre-charged and I only had to charge them for like 30 minutes but I know it takes around 2 hours to fully charge them and they lasted me a solid 6 hours before they died out. The only con I had was they are a little low when at full level. I know another reviewer stated they were loud but mine were not so not sure about that. As for recommended these headphones I can do that with no problem !! They sound really good and are really made very well plus they come with a lot of extras. My favorite thing about these headphones is that the ear hooks really keep the headphones in place. I can run in them and they don't move one bit and you get several different sizes to fit any ear size. So if your in the market for a pair of bluetooth headphones pick up the Jesbod QY19 Headphones you won't be
disappointed !!!!

Allows you access to all buttons and ports easily on your phone. Love the color with the black and gold and it's a beautiful color in person. This is a case worth it's price and one I would recommend. Please note that I did receive this product at a free or reduced price in order to try and provide my honest and unbiased feedback on. My review is strictly based on my perception and opinion of this product,1
"My dog does alot of running and playing and he is always hurting his front leg or back leg. Me personally I think he has weak bones or fragile muscles. When I received the supports for his front legs I was really excited to try them on him. I had to fight him to get them on st first but after a few times he finally just lets me put them on him . He can run and jump just like he always does but he seems to have more support with the sleeves on. These are great for active dogs and dogs that just need that little extra support.

I received this item for my unbiased review . The thoughts in my review ate that of my own",1
Appears good so far (1-2 months).  Assembled easily.  Comfortable and works as described.  Height adjustment is a little tricky to get a fine adjustment.,0
"This great little umbrella was just what I was looking for.  I love the reflective ends so that in dreary rainy weather you can still be seen.  Its compact enough to fit into tight spaces in your car and super light weight.  It opens with just the touch of a button which comes in handy when you are carrying around multiple things.  It also comes in a super cute carrier that has a closure clasp that helps tighten it snug to the umbrella. This carrier also works to keep your wet umbrella from soaking all your stuff after use.

"Wow these things are a Great Value!!

The SUNGAIT Men's Fashion Sports Polarized Sunglasses for Cycling Running Golf - UV400, I believe are a great value for the money.

The packaging was top notch as well as the included accessories.  In the box you have a carrying case, a rag for cleaning and a small screwdriver for any quick adjustments you need to make.  They were packaged better that my $150 pair of Maui Jims.

I would highly suggest these SUNGAIT Men's Fashion Sports Polarized Sunglasses for Cycling Running Golf - UV400 for anyone that needs a good quality pair of sunglasses.  I wear mine when at the beach or pool or playing volleyball in the sand.  They are light enough to not be a burden but solid enough not to go flying off your face.

I did receive these at a discounted rate for my fair and unbiased review.

In the event I need another pair of SUNGAIT Men's Fashion Sports Polarized Sunglasses for Cycling Running Golf - UV400 I would gladly pay full price!

"Hello All,
I received this item free of charge to review it, and I'll tell you. It's worth it!!
I received the #hausandgarten titanium pruning shears! Ironically, the day i received it, i really needed to do some yard work! While my fiance mowed the yard, i did pruning and ""deadheading""! I was so impressed with the item! Usually when I use shears, my hands ALWAYS ache after I am done. However, when I finished using these, my hands did not ache!! Another thing that is awesome, is maybe my older pair of shears were too rusty, but usually i have to cut a few times for anything to actually cut off! I tell you what, These slice so nicely and neatly! It's not just something to kind of just swing with. This is definitely a product I recommend all you master gardeners!!",1
"Awesome trail camera here. The best part about this camera is the built in lcd screen to view your images. It is smaller to which is a key point to me. Seems very durable and well built. Takes a great image and has great shots in the dark. Has many functions to suit your needs and times. I did receive this product at a discount for an honest unbiased review. I always test every product thoroughly prior to writing a review. I write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. I was not paid to write this review nor asked to give a good review. This is my honest opinion of the product.

My star ratings go as follows.

(Five Stars) - Great product and meets or exceeds the description and my standards
(Four Stars) - Product is good but might be missing something or quality might be less but still a good product
(Three Stars) - Product is Average nothing speacial
(Two Stars) - I wouldn't Recommend this Product. Not a good purchase
(One Star) - Terrible Product. Not worth any ones time.",1

Very nice.  Very comfortable.  They aren't hot,0
"There are a couple reasons I gave this a 3 and not higher.  The first is that it does not work with a case.  The case pushed the sides up and it was no longer flush to the screen causing it to lose touch sensitivity.  And the second is the top and bottom  ""gold""  color.  It did not match the original phone's color at all! It would have been better to just have it completely clear. The color made my phone look cheap. So if you do not mind the color and you are not planning on using a case,  the screen protector fit great and my screen lost no sensitivity to touch.  I cannot comment on the durability and reliability though because I took it off right away.",0
"This is a really cool and well made tracker, below I'll list some of my favorite Pros & Cons. Overall I really like the matte black color and it works super well with my iPhone, I got real time notifications for my smart WiFi doorbell and texts and calls etc.

Note that texts when pushed through if their super long texts they won't be displayed only the first bit of the text shows, also when someone texts you there is no caller ID info for the text, it just displays the text for around 6-8 seconds.

Phone calls that came in also were displayed for the duration of the phone call ringing your phone, and just the callers name was there if you have them saved in your phone, if their not saved under a contact in your phone then it'll display the phone number calling.

Battery does last a nice long time. If your interested in seeing a real time push notification watch my vlogs on Bensbergfilms on YouTube I show you how this tracker works with my smart WiFi doorbell pushing notifications.

Pros:
Heart Rate Monitor
iPhone push notifications, read above info for texts, I was using my iPhone 6
It does have twist of the wrist on off, like the apple watch, but if your doing lots of movement especially in a movie theater well that gets annoying fast, I would only turn that on during a run etc.

Cons:
Band does take a little getting used to clasping it, but it never came loose on me so that's cool.
Even when I was in the option for heart rate monitor only when I chose to see it, I would set my tracker down on the table at night and I would see a green glow coming from the bottom trying to take my heart rate, I looked again and tried to turn it off, it would go off then pop back on, it was pretty annoying at night in bed, so I would have to get up and turn the whole tracker off so I wouldn't see a green glow, it's pretty bright. When it's on your wrist nice and tightly I don't see the green glow if your wondering.

****Update as I'm writing this review it looks like they just updated the app for what I'm mentioning above, in the app it looks like you can turn the All Day Heart Rate on or off.)

App is cool they just updated the app so us in the US can have standard (imperial) measurements and 12hr time.

It does have a cool charger that latches on.

Overall its a cool tracker, and I have been using it everyday since I got it. I did receive this product as a free sample so that I could provide my best evaluation. I hope my comments and photos will help you make an informed decision.

"I got these a week ago as a trial set based on me reviewing them.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened them to find the ear pieces are adjustable over the ear.  I've gone thru 5 Bluetooth in the last 2 years, either they don't fit, fall off & break or they just can't hold up to my sweat even though they say they're sweatproof. I also have small ears, so even the small buds are often too big & fall out.  While these are still a little big for me, with the adjustable hook they hold in, even after a 20 minute run & 15 minutes hiit-style circuit strength training workout right after I couldn't shake them loose.  I even kept them in for yoga the next day & they stayed through all the moves.  I will say the sound is not amazing but I'm using these for working out where I just need to here my metal for weightlifting or trance for running to keep my focus & MOJO going.  They're decent in sound - good enough for me.  I cant attest to the sweatproof as a week isn't enough time, but if these hold up in another 3 months I'll update as that's pretty awesome (seriously, I sweat enough that I've slipped on the floor & almost thrown a weight thru the window - lol!)
All in all, if you need something that works, holds up & adjusts to fit & stay put, I'd recommend these
I received these for free as a trial for my unbiased review after a week.  They passed for what I needed, hope they work for you as well.",1

"This bra is sexy and comfortable! The lace back is stunning and the front clasp is nice addition (I think hubby will like it too)! I love that this is a razorback bra!! I love razorback tanks for the summer and always have to wear a sports bra or a clip to bring my bra straps together which can be uncomfortable at times, but this bra is the perfect solution. When speaking with the seller, it was recommended to order a size up in cup and band for this bra as it runs one cup and band size small. I usually wear a 36C and the seller recommended I order a 38D and it fits perfectly.

I received this bra at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1

"The quality of these pens is impeccable. They flow beautifully on the page and the design is pretty nifty. The ink doesn't seem to smudge too much, because with any gel pen there is going to be smudging. The colors are vibrant and pop right off of the page. The value of these is also remarkable. I would HIGHLY recommend these to anyone.

I absolutely LOVE these gel pens. They are certainly one of my favorites. I purchased a set of pens a month or so back and fell in love with them. I use them a lot in my adult coloring. I don't get to color as much as I'd like to because I'm a single momma so my sister asked to borrow my set. She texted me asking me where she could find some because she just loved them so much. I went looking and found these and ordered her a set.

Key points:
-Great assortment of colors.
-Neat pen design.
-Beautiful, vibrant colors.
-Wonderful Value.
-Ink flows nicely onto the page.
-Minimal smudging.

"I'm putting this away until Christmas for a stocking stuffer for my teen...but I've been enjoying it for a few days when he's not around. It works great on both my iPad Air and iPhone 6. Bluetooth matched up fast. No problem. It's loud when it connects. A female voice says, ""Bluetooth is now connected.""...or something like that. I've been charging it with the cord it came with. You'll need a wall adapter to plug in the cord. A red light comes on so you know it's charging. The LED lights on the speaker are of course the entire reason to buy this. Very cool. The lights change colors with the beat. So far I've only listened to music on this so I'll update this review later after we use it more. I think it's such a cool little speaker and my teen is gonna love it.

"Very sturdy stand.  At work I use two different laptops. One of which is hooked up to a big monitor and has it's own docking station.  The other, however, is just a laptop that I have to pull out from time to time to look at a few things. For the longest time I have had it sitting on the floor next to my work station and I will just pick it up and put it on my deck when I need it.  Now I don't have to.  It has a very nice and appealing stand that it can sit in on my desk. The stand is foldable if you ever need it to be.  For myself it stays right at the side of my desk and the laptop just fits right into place without any issues what so ever.  I am very happy to have this! It makes my desk seem just a little bit more organized.  Plus there is much less of a chance of the laptop becoming damaged from just sitting on the floor.  Great stand. Very glad I got it.

"This bag is large, it accommodates for everything I need. You could use it as a school bag if you want too. Very solid bag",0
"Love this arm band! It is a great size for a mom, who usually has a child or 2 along that always needs something, it has room for that. The larger zippered pouch has enough room for my phone and bandaids or other larger items. The small pouch is great for keys or an extra hot wheel car. I think once you find the right squeeze, it stays put while running. I did notice that you have to poke your own hole for the earphone cord, or else with the double zipper on the larger pocket, you can just put it out the top. The uv indicator is great and it works very fast. I like that it helps me figure out if and when I need to apply sunscreen. I have used several different types of armbands and this is my favorite because it has plenty of room for all the things I need.

"Strap s not very elegant; I would have liked something all leather instead of the nylon extensions near the camera.  When it is open, the hanging part bobs up and down in front of the lens.  No weather protection but moderate bump protection.  Not horrible.",0
"This has 4H hardness, though 9H is preferred. Also, ever since using a screen protector with the spray method, I'm never going back to single-application screen protectors. You have too much room for error with the ones that you have to eyeball the alignment without letting any air dust get stuck on the sticky side.

"The Rapid Pizza ReHeater is exactly as its name says, a Rapid Pizza ReHeater. It is ready to use straight out of the box, you just fill the compartment at the top, with water (to the marked fill line), place your piece of pizza on it, and Microwave for one minute. Now microwaves do vary in size and power, so cooking times may vary. It took about 40 seconds in my microwave and tasted Delicious. Honestly, I was surprised at the difference. The Pizza ReHeater was easy to clean and is dishwasher safe. Overall, I'm extremely happy I was able to get the Rapid Pizza ReHeater, as everyone in my household loves it and uses it every time someone reheats pizza. In my opinion it's worth the money, especially if you have left over pizza a lot.

"i was given this tray for free to provide my honest review and feedback.
This little bed tray is so cute!!  My hubby and I always fight over the tv at night in bed.  He wants to watch sports and I want to turn on netflix to watch Gilmore Girls.  The reason neither one of us want to use the laptop is because the only place to put it is on our stomach or a pillow.  Neither one is steady and not ideal tv watching conditions.
The tray is perfect it gives us a flat steady place to put the laptop without having to worry about it moving around.  Now I am not saying jump on the bed steady.  I just mean you can move a bit without it moving.
The tray looks pretty, so even when I am not using it I don't mind having it sit in my room.",1
"I am very pleased with this cable and it is actually is a lot better than I expected after reading other reviews about some of the cables sold being too thin, breaking and more.

"This bug zapper doesn't a good job at zapping the bugs. It is made out of plastic and metal around the zapper part. The zapper is powered by solar power. This bug zapper come with any instructions. The set up of the bug zapper is easy. I have my hanging outside of my sliding glass door to help kill the fly and bugs before they enter the house. This is great for the summer, especially when we bbq a lot. The flies often come in while we are going in and out when bbqing. This bug zapper does a good job getting rid of them before they can come into the house. The light also attracts them at night time. You have a choice to hang this bug zapper or stick it out of the ground. The bug zapper had a hanger and a post. The post comes in 3 different pieces. You could adjust the height of the post by removing pieces if you need. The end of the post is pointed allowing it to be easier to insert into the ground.

"These seem like a great set of phones for the money.
I didn't get them for free like some of these other reviewers, but pad $25.
So far they work awesome. Sound quality is good, mic is good (no one has complained during a phone call).
The connection is solid. I haven't had it drop out once. I even went into the next room without issue.
The battery level displays on my iPhone 7 which is cool.
The only complaints are minor:
- The way the cord hangs down I wouldn't use these for running or exercise (I don't intend to so it's not a problem)
- The cord coming out of each earpiece rattles around with movement but I took a little piece of gaff tape and wedged it in the slot and now there's no issue.
- The little light that flashes when they are on is annoying, especially in the dark (again fixed with another small piece of black gaff tape).
Overall happy so far...will update if they fall apart fast.",0
"This top is a nice, loose, dressy type of top. The fabric isn't like any chiffon that I have. It has a bit of a rougher more textured feel. It definitely is a little sheer, so I will be wearing a cami underneath it. I really like the length of the back, it covers your rear. I only wish it was a little bit looser and more flowy. This will be nice and cool to wear to work during the summer.

"I have the Planet Bike ARS 'classic' saddle on my daily commuter bike and decided to give this model a try on my bike for longer, more rigorous rides.

Not sure if it will hold up for 50+ mile rides, but I'm looking forward to giving it a shot.",0

"Well... like the stars say, this dress is just ok. I was a little worried about ordering a dress in this style, since it only came in ""one size."" I don't have small boobs, but they don't always look good in this type of neckline because they are spaced far apart. This fear realized when I got this dress and tried it on. The boob pockets are quite large, which I imagine is great for bustier ladies... but not so much for my 34B boobs. The extra material does lay flat and look ok, but there are times when it slips down and reveals a bit too much boob. It was a little awkward because I wore it to my boyfriend's family's memorial day party and kept looking down to see that my bra was slightly exposed. Oops.

Other than that, the colors are nice, and everywhere else fits ok. It is stretchy so I imagine larger people could fit in it. But like I said, probably people smaller than me (Size 8) should avoid it. Other than that, I also felt it looked a bit... juvenile? Maybe that's because I couldn't fill out the top, but I kind of felt like it looks like a little girl's dress. I dunno, maybe it has to do with the lengths and the not very feminine waist? I'll keep this dress, but I don't think I will wear it too often.

Holy Cow! These lights will blind you if you have them too close to the floor. Good news is its a chandelier so they are going to be up in the air. My husband and i just purchased a chandelier recently but didn't have the lights for it so we got these. We had all the lights off and plugged in only the chandelier and it lite up the entire kitchen dining room and living room. We have an open floor plan. Our chandelier only rewuires 4 light bulbs so the fact that i didn't need all six and it lite up three rooms was insane. My husbands first reaction was hey get some more of these. Lol. He loves them and its going to be beautiful once we get it hung up. We highly recommend these to your family. They came in on time the seller was great to work with and the package was highly protected. (please see package feedback). In the pictures i showed you two different pictures of the same thing. I just cropped my sink put because there were dirty dishes in there so i just darkened the background in one but really wanted you to see the intensity of the light so i decided to crop the other half of the sink all together so you can see the light by itself untouched. Then the first picture is what you see when you open that package. Great quality we really enjoy them.",1
"I purchased these Bukm noise canceling ear buds with microphone for when I cut the grass. I like to be able to listen to my books on tape.  They came in a nice velvet gray draw string bag but inside that bag was a cheap zip lock back with a pack of replacement earbuds in 3 different sizes.  I did not care for the dull color of the gold. It looks washed out and cheap. I did like that I could control the volumn from the earbuds. It has a button that you push once to pause, twice to go forward and three times to go back. There is a little switch on the front that changes the sound, making it more scratchy and quite but for the life of my I could not find out it purpose. The base sounded good. It did cancel noise around you when you have the perfect fit buds.  I have had better but they work well for a backup.
I did try the phone call out and it sounded ok to those on the other end. They could tell that I was using something because I sounded distant to them.

"This pad made an uncomfortably hard mattress a very nice sleeping surface.  I did put an additional organic cotton mattress protector over the pad, since I'm a bit concerned about microscopic fibers escaping and becoming airborne particulate.  However, the mattress was previously so hard that I would wake up with sore muscles and sore back.  This pad has alleviated those problems.  And my granddaughter loves snuggling on the bed now.",0
"NOTE: The seller graciously provided me with a sample of this product and asked me to write a review.

For years, the pencil eraser has been about the most basic office supply around, one that would seem to be impervious to technology. However, when Ishua asked me to try their new electric eraser, I was intrigued about how it would work, and I also thought that my artistically inclined grandson could find it useful. It does work, and for people who do something more intricate or artistic than just jotting down notes, it's more precise, giving the user more control over what does and does not get erased. However, the design could definitely be improved.

The Ishua Electric eraser is a plastic cylindrical device that has an opening on one end for the eraser tips themselves. The main unit is black plastic, 4.5"" long. It measures about 1"" x 0.75"" and fits comfortably in one hand. The eraser uses 2 AAA batteries (not included). The battery compartment is on the bottom of the unit, opposite the eraser tips, and the cover slides on and off. Unfortunately, it's rather difficult to slide off, and, once you get it off, it takes a bit of work to get the cover to fit in the right grooves and slide shut properly.

The eraser tip is held in place by a metal clamp that slides easily in and out of a hole on the top of the main eraser unit. The clamp is 1"" long, but when inserted into the top of the eraser, only 0.25"" is exposed. The eraser tip fits inside the clamp and when the clamp is inserted in the opening on the main unit, it gets squeezed s*** and thus clamps down on the tip, holding it securely in place. As the eraser tip wears down, the clamp can be removed and the remainder of the tip pulled further out for more use. The eraser is shipped with the clamp and an eraser tip already in place, and the kit includes 20 eraser refills (for a total of 21 tips). Additional refill tips are readily available from several sellers on Amazon. The kit also comes with a 4.5 white plastic brush to clear away the bits of used eraser.

The Ishua eraser is controlled by a power button on the side that must remain depressed for the eraser to stay on. When the eraser is in use, the clamp and tip rotate at a fairly high rate of speed. When you grip the eraser using all five fingers, the button is directly under your thumb, allowing you to turn the unit on or off easily while holding the eraser horizontally. Unfortunately, that position does not allow you to use the eraser optimally. You can also grip the eraser in the same way you would grip a pencil, with your thumb and first two fingers, and, once again, the thumb will be right over the power button.

The eraser does a good job of removing graphite (pencil markings) from a piece of paper. You don't have to press down very hard for it to work. Further, the eraser works on colored pencil markings as well as standard ones. Because the tip is so narrow, (about 1/8 in diameter), you can erase only the area of the drawing or document you want, simply tracing the original writing, rather than having to rub a standard eraser back and forth like using a paintbrush. This is very helpful for making corrections or changes in artwork or engineering drawings.

The problem with the Ishua eraser is one caused by the physics involved in its use. The rapidly rotating eraser tip builds up a lot of centrifugal force, and when it touches a fairly light piece of paper, that paper has a tendency to move. This means that its advisable to hold down the paper while using the eraser to keep it from crinkling up or jerking away. I haven't had a piece of paper tear, but its somewhat awkward to continue to hold the paper down to prevent the eraser from jumping around. Plus, you need to watch how much of the eraser tip you're using. If the tip gets worn all the way down to the clamp, you might wind up applying a rotating metal clamp on the paper, which can easily tear or damage the paper.

Overall, the Ishua eraser is a useful device, and for people with physical limitations with their hands or who do precision work, it could be very helpful. However, those same people may well have difficulty installing the batteries or replacing the eraser tips due to the design. Others should ask to what extent they actually need an eraser to determine how much use this will actually be for them. Also, in practice it takes a while to get used to the effect the eraser has on the paper that you're trying to erase. With these caveats in mind, Id recommend the Ishua eraser.",1
"I replaced my old conventional hose and I could not be happier with this product. It is light, easy to use. It remains to be seen how long it would last with the uv light.
Update: this hose is good while it lasts, and it appears that 1 year or less it's the life span. I received a replacement for free from the company within a year, but the second one failed again. I think the price is way too high for something that fails within a year or so.",1

These glasses are a fantastic deal.  I love them.  These hold up well and have a great lenses.  An amazing price!  I have bought 4 pair already.,0
This bag has its positives and negatives. First  of  all let me start off by saying  that this bag is extremely  lightweight. The hardware  that is used is on the larger side making  it easy to open. The option  of wearing it with the chain or as a clutch is definitely  appealing as well. But here are the negatives...! It's not real leather but whatever it is it looks like a piece  of folded material. I'm just  not  that  impressed  by the exterior  look and feel  of this handbag.

"I bought this lanyard to use on our next cruise. I have a rhinestone looking one that I bought on a cruise ship but thought it might be nice to have a little variety. I am impressed that this lanyard is actually hand beaded in the United States and not China. The beads are very pretty with shades of black and white and should look good with all my outfits. Although it seems very strong, this lanyard weighs less than three ounces and is 34"" long. It is made with 19 strand wire and has a 48 pound break point.

So I just set up my new iRulu 8GB Tablet. What an easy set up! I charged it (per the instructions) for a full 24 hours before I used it. Then I turned it on and followed the easy set up instructions. I did have trouble first connecting to my wifi but then when I clicked the back button and did it again it worked just fine. That was the only funky thing so far.

I have been watching Youtube videos and the screen looks GREAT! The volume does not go up too far but it is loud enough for me.

I have been messing around downloading applications and using the internet and it is fast and working great! The camera is not that great and the volume doesn't go very high and truly that is the only reason I rated this a 4 and not a 5.

This product is plastic and it has 8GB of memory. It comes with a charger and also a USB to hook to your computer. Overall this product is a really great value! I would recommend this product if you just want a basic tablet to play games and surf the web on.

This product seems to be working.  But I do think it upsets one of my chihuahua's stomach.  Others are doing fine.  But we started having problems with my new rescued bull dog.  She was in a mill and as I understand they want to keep their areas clean and that is why they begin doing it.,0
"These are great little knives for my keychain... I work in retail, so I open a lot of boxes and this saves my nails and pens, LOL... Gave the other to my co-woker, LOL...Quality seems decent and I've had no problems with these so far... Plus, they're so convenient! I can find them at the drop of the dime... I received these keychains at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review...",1
Unfortunately I can't put a zero rating because that is what this case deserves.  It broke in 4 DAYS!!  I didn't even drop it but the hard plastic part broke by the charging port.  Even worse is you can't operate the silencer switch on the side without using a paperclip because it is so think on the sides.  Buy any other case but this one.,0
Worked great for about a year before it suddenly stopped working.,0
"I needed a new pair of gloves and thought I would try these out. My right wrist tends to hurt if I am in the saddle for more than an hour and in the handle bar drops. These gloves are great at relieving some of the pressure. They provide just enough padding to delay the onset of pain. They are well made and fit well.  Overall a great pair of gloves.

5 stars  I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend everyone to purchase this product!
4 stars  I like it, but there are some flaws. Don't we all have flaws? I would purchase again.
3 stars - It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless there are no other options.
2 stars  There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices.
1 star  I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and recommend others to not purchase.

"My order arrived on time for my Memorial Day weekend trip. I installed the pole to luggage rack using only one of the rubber pads. very secure and looked good. The quality of the flag is not very good. after 100 miles the stitching at the top of the flag was coming apart. I left it there hoping to find a small sewing kit to make repairs at end of day. Got to destination and flag was long gone, slipped off top of pole I assume. Flag should be better quality with a retention clip or larger top piece to keep flag secure. Surely disappointed, and now i have to find a replacement Flag.",0
"Update 5/12/16  While I originally reviewed this for my husband and gave it three stars because the hat was too small for him and he said it was itchy, I am changing my review.  The hat fits me very well!! lol I love it and it is not itchy at all!!  I love the cool breeze and I have been wearing it all the time.  I even ordered a women's hat from this company for myself because of it.  As much as I love it I am still only giving it 4 stars because it is a man's hat but it did not fit my husband.  Other than that though, big thumbs up!!!

We received this product on time and was packaged very well.  I purchased this hat in white for my husband for the Summer season in Texas.  He normally wears this style hat in the Winter season but it is much too thick for the hot Summer. So when I saw this I scooped it up!  While the mesh is nice and breezy, it is also a thick, rough and itchy fabric. There goes one star for my husband.  The light color does keep the heat from being absorbed thus keeping his head cool but still protected from the sun.  With his head shaved it burns easily.  The reason I am taking away a second star is because it is in fact too tight for his head.  I did not see where to request a size when ordering so I assumed it would have some stretch to it but not the case.  It fits my head pretty well but his is a bit bigger.  He is still wearing it to see if it will get broken in and give a little in the fabric so he can wear it comfortably.  All n' all it is a perfect hat to use for a warm season but is just too small.

works well for quick charging in middle of raft trip,0
"These are just so cute. I bought really pretty glittery ones for my daughter and for my son I wanted something a little more neutral. The animals are very well drawn and there cute. There very easily recognizable. The paper is on heavy duty card stock and are not on thin paper. They are blank on the inside which makes it better to write a heart felt thank you instead of a generic message. My daughter likes picking out who gets what animal. There great and make the thank you process enjoyable.

"Worth the price ~10. I use it for cutting many fruits and vegetables. Normally I would not pay over $3 for a knife, but I have two of these in my kitchen and they are used every day. Paying $10 is well worth it. My first one has been in use daily for over 3 years and never been sharpened.",0
"I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review. I am very pleased with it, I don't use it for beer, instead I use it for tea. The brushe is handy for cleaning, and the sizes right for my daily use.  64 ounces of iced tea is just right for me to carry around all day.  I put some ice inside, along with my tea, and it keeps it cool throughout the day. I would think it would work equally well for beer, although perhaps not for all day.  I'll let other reviewers discuss its efficacy for beer.

 It's very well-made. Stainless steel is of a deal material for holding  drinking liquids. I get the feeling I will have this for a very long time. It's very useful. I would consider buying one as a gift  for someone like me that would use it often.",1
"I make coffee just about every morning and until now I've used a single cup coffee maker. I received this KRUPS programmable coffee maker for free in exchange for a review. While I usually use a single cup coffee maker, I did enjoy this KRUPS Savoy. It looks great, gets the job done and is easy to program and use. The downside is that I noticed my coffee tastes a little different when using this coffee maker. Maybe it's because my old coffee maker is a single cup coffee maker?",1
These are cool. The ice cubes come out looking classy & fancy. I received these trays at a discount for my honest review.,1
I really love the look and durability of the case but unfortunately mine came damaged. There is a scratch on the front that removed the purple paint and left a blue metallic mark. Other than that...it's a good case.,0
Holding up very well after months of use. Fast speeds and very reliable,0
"The ring arrived on time so that was a happy surprise,  I had originally bought this ring for my husband but it fit me so perfectly I decided to hold on to it, you see I've lost weight recently and my original wedding band doesn't fit me anymore and I need to have it resized but this has acted as a beautiful temporary replacement, and due to the fact that I haven't been able to wear my wedding band without losing it I've been feeling very lonesome and we have had some fairly Unfortunate Events take place in our family this year so just to be able to have a symbol of my connection to my wonderful husband has meant the world to me especially in these trying times, and after an accident with our son I haven't been able to see my husband as much and it has been putting a huge strain on me emotionally so having this ring has gotten me through some very rough time's.  The design is beautiful, the ring is of good quality, and it means the world to me already. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
I love it. It'a very strong vaccum and easy to use.,0
Freakin awesome screen protector!,0
"These parts fit perfectly in my Roomba(620 Series). However to be honest I noticed one particular problem - after I changed out the filter and the two brushes, my Roomba seems to charge towards me from time to time. Like I'll be in the kitchen, loading the dishwasher and the Roomba will be the living room cleaning under the sofa and all will be wonderful. When all of a sudden the Roomba will spot me, change direction and come barreling towards my feet. It's the weirdest thing. Sometimes it even follows me around the room.
Wonder if it is trying to kill me. Doesn't seem right though because that would mean the Roomba is breaking the first rule of robotics.",0
"If you enjoy making delicious asian food at home you are going to need these! I really like having the right tools in my kitchen and at the table. My daughters love asian food and I have had to learn how to make it at home. We were having to go out all of the time, and it can get very expensive. When we would get take out we would ask for some extra chopsticks. Those are not the type of chopstick you want to wash and reuse. This pack of ten natural bamboo chopsticks is great. Now everyone can have a pair and when we have company they can have a pair as well. These are very nice, they are not the cheap ones you get at the Chinese resaurant. These have not splintered or pealed at all. They have a very nice finish to them, simple and beautiful, ultra smooth to the touch, and balanced to fit comfortably in your hand. I like the light color and they seem to be unfinished, meaning they are natural without oils or paint. The shape starts off round at one tip and turns square as it reaches the back. I like that because it's not going to roll, it stays put on your plate or next to your plate. Although they are very lightweight they are durable. They have held up through washing and regular use. We have not had any of them warping or breaking. It's a great buy for every table.
I received the natural bamboo chopsticks for a promotional price to try, test and give an honest and unbiased review.",1
"These retractable cords are perfect for the children, and around the house, so there are not tons and tons of length or cord rolling around the house when you need to charge a phone or tablet. I'm glad that we have extra cords around. We have been using these for quite a bit, and they are still in great condition, and still retract just as easily as when they were first purchased.",0
"I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, but unfortunately thought it was an external hard drive, when actually it's some sort of case for an external hard drive. The title says ""USB 3.0 External"" but I guess I should have read more carefully. Am returning this and will keep looking for something else. Otherwise seems to be a solid product.",1
"I will be getting married this September and my fianc is worried about damaging his ring while lifting and doing home repairs. The best solution was to purchase another ring but that would not hurt his hand while he is lifting so I discovered this silicone ring. I received them yesterday and my fianc immediately tried them out. The ring does not bother him at all and if it starts to break down, its fine because it comes with an order of 3. This is a great ring if you are going swimming or your husband works with his hands. I tried to see if the silicone band could go over his wedding band but it does not. SO if you are looking to use it to cover your existing band you will have to go a size up. I am not connected to the seller and did not receive any monetary gain from writing this review. I write honest reviews in hopes that it will help individuals with their purchase. I did receive this item for free or at a discount price for my honest review.",1
This is great idea for cell phone. Me and my girlfriend go on a vacation to a cabin so it just us. So it we want to take a picture of all of us. We have to find book to hold up our phone to take the picture.  This make it so much nicer. We just place the phone it the holder. Then set a timer. We know that the phine is not going to move after we set it up. It that a great picture.  I was so happen to get it in time for our trip this year. I will be using it for our family Christmas l. Now if they can find away to keep my dog still then that would be great. I received this product for free or reduce prices for my honest review.,1
"The iFlash 2 Pack of Tempered Glass Screen Protector For Samsung Galaxy Note 5 was made with my phone in mind! It fits perfectly!!
The tempered screen is made of high quality ultra thin glass. It was rather easy to install. With the screen protector on my phone, I have not seen a decrease or has it affected my screens sensitivity. The clarity of the tempered glass is crystal clear. What I like most about this tempered glass screen protector is that it has greatly reduced finger smudge. I am not a fan of finger smudge. Yuck!! Honestly, the edges are rounded so I almost never realize that my screen is protected. I am using it as is and it has not chip.

This package came with 2 screen protectors. The well written installation instruction was helpful in applying the ultra thin glass. It came with a dust remover tape (super handy), Cleaning cloth, an alcohol wipe and of course the Bubble squeegee. With the instructions, installation was a breeze! It has not scratch, chip, or cracked. This is well worth every dime!! I highly recommend this product that I received free of cost for my unbiased and honest opinion.",1

This case cover is designed to fit the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and it did just that.
I like the metallic look and the texture on the case providing a good grip.
It fits perfectly and it is easy to install / remove. It have access to all plugs, ports, buttons, camera, and stylus.
It doesn't add extra weight and bulkiness. The interior have ridges in it so it keeps your phone cool and doesn't cause the phone to overheat.
I wish the silver part that wraps around the silicone is a little tougher and harder though.

I received this product at a discounted price / free in exchange for my true, unbiased and honest product review. I hope you find my review about this product useful and helpful and I hope that this product satisfies and meets your needs and I hope that it works for you. As for me, I am very thankful that this seller gave me the opportunity to review this awesome product.",1
It lasted a long time but the edges started to chip off and left my phone vulnerable... my screen cracked.,0
I LOVE how this umbrella opens up & how easy it is to use. I've never seen an umbrella open & close this way. You push a little button then push up just how you would a normal umbrella & it inverts correctly. This way the outside of the umbrella stays dry because the wet side is on the inside. I also like the unique handle which allows me to use this on my arm while carrying my child keeping my hands free. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.,1

"Exactly as described and shown in the photo.

"This is my new go-to summer dress. I wear it once a week with nude sandals because it's so comfy. It's the best-fitting and most comfortable dress I own. The material is soft and stretchy. I love the floral design and it's just the right thickness. This dress is airy and flows nicely. It's great for summer but can also be paired with leggings for autumn.

I wear an 8 in bottoms and a small in tops. I ordered the color blue in a size medium and it fits great. The waistline hits just above my natural waistline. Since I have such a wide and disproportionate waist, this is much more flattering.  I'm 5'2"" and the length is just right for me. If you're a few inches taller than me, you might have to wear it as a tunic. I throw it in the washing machine and hang it up to dry and it's held up great.

I received this at no cost during a promotional period in exchange for my honest review.",1

"I purchased this holster based on the relatively good reviews.  I have to admit, I'm confused why it has a four star rating.  This holster has a serious design flaw that would be easy for the manufacture to fix and it would be a good holster.  Let me explain:

1) 99.9% of the time, the holster comes off with the gun when drawing the gun.  That could get you killed if you were trying to use your weapon for self defense.  I will explain a possible fix later in my review..
2) The holster works loose when sitting or moving up and down causing your pistol to fall on the ground.  In some locations, it is against the law for your concealed weapon to show.  If it falls out in public you could be arrested and prosecuted.  Check your local laws.  I would imagine the MFG could have some serious liability problems with this holster.
3) The problem is the clip.  The clip is designed to go over the waste band, but under the belt, or the belt is supposed to be outside the clip.  The problem is that the lip on the click that is meant to keep the holster from coming off when you draw is too small and ramped.  The result is the holder comes off the with the gun almost every time it is drawn.

I will be returning mine as defective.

Update: 12/22/16
I retried this holster with a much smaller weapon.  An M&P shield.  The holster still comes off with the weapon when its drawn.  A very, very dangerous thing.  I don't recommend this holster with any weapon of any kind.",0
exactly what you expect,0
"I received the product for free but I can tell you that it just works.
After watching the video on how to install this wet style screen protector it was much easy than the sticky waterless version.

The water will allow the screen protector to slide around until you can line the film up with the home button ect.
The only thing I wish this product came with is a little rubber squeegee to help push the water out without risking scuffing up the film.
I let the screen dry over night and it looks great. Just be really careful to avoid pet hair and dust from getting in the way.

I heard apply the screen protector on in a steamy room with the shower running can help prevent dust. I have not tried this.",1
"This case is a beautiful case! The design looks great and adds a nice look to a phone. Not only is this case very decorative, but it also is a snug fit on the phone. This case is light weight, and adds very little extra size to the phone. At first the phone did not want to go in the protective plastic like piece that secures the phone, but once I got it in there, it looks very nice. I don't know about you, but I would rather have a little difficulty getting the phone squeezed in there and have a snug fit than the phone slide in easily and not stay in the case. If you are looking for a cute wallet style phone case, I would recommend this case.
I received this product at a discount and in return I am to submit an honest opinion about the product.",1
"Oh how I love these boots! They DID hurt while breaking them in and they still feel slightly snug, but I'm used to that with Frye--they will break in.
I ended up taking these to a festival I was working out and kinda freaked out when the zipper on my other boots broke--leaving these as the only option in the mud. I was so concerned that they would be ruined (I hadn't treated them yet) but they held up great and now are looking lovingly broken in. The slouch was perfect for me and they are great everyday boots. I have big calves and I find these still to be pretty flattering with skirts...
The only slightly annoying thing is the jingle sound the buckle makes when I'm walking.",0
"What does two stars mean? It means ""I don't like it."" And I don't. I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. My honest review is that, while it's a good idea, it has major problems that make it not worth the effort of trying to use it.

(1) It's extremely fiddly to get your phone to fit into the cradle and line up with the tiny hole at the end of the lens holder. You can first have to adjust the phone in the cradle so your camera buttons aren't covered up, and then you have to adjust the phone cradle part up and down on a little track until you can match up the camera hole with the lens holder.

(2) It's hard to get the telephoto lens positioned correctly into the lens holder as well. I kept winding up with my phone leaning sideways and there was no way I could figure out to fix it and also have the lens seated into the lens holder properly.

(3) After you do finally get the setup close enough to be able to see anything at all through the lens, what you get is a small round circle (the whole circle only if you are extremely lucky, but most likely only a partial circle), and then the image you shoot is just that circle.

(4) It is very hard to get it into focus, and then it drifts out of focus easily.

I don't like it. If I weren't obligated to review it and had purchased it directly, I would not have bothered with it more than half an hour before I would have sent it back. As it stands, I've farted around with it for days trying to give it a chance. It was a complete waste of time. I was going to post photos of what kind of images you can expect from this lens, but all I could get out of it with my Amazon Firephone were nebulous blobs.",1
A nice quality well built Dry erase board. We bought it for our kids room for them to color and draw on. Included accessories is also a nice touch.

"I was a little nervous about ordering a swim suit online but liked the look of this one. I ordered an XL and I wear about a size 16 in most things, 16w in pants at times. I will spare everyone a picture of me in it but it fits great! I am absolutely thrilled with it! The material is typical swimsuit material. I love the design and colors look just like the picture. It is solid blue on the back but that is fine with me. I have curves so the design on front is great. It has a liner too which fit comfortably. I have not washed this swimsuit yet but it does say handwash and not to use the dryer, which I do with my swimsuits anyway. I think it will hold up well since it appears well made. I am excited to sport it this summer! I would recommend this to people looking for a swimsuit and even if you are on the heavier side like me it looks and fits great!

Note: I did receive this item at a discount in return for my honest opinion.
I would consider buying another swimsuit from this buyer at their regular price for sure!",1
So far so good. It fits my grill perfectly and is not to thin. We will see how it holds up.,0
"This is s good flashlight. It requires 3 AAA BAtteries (not included). I wish they were included. I love the adjustment featured of the light going from tunnel to wide span. Great zoom in and zoom out. It's light weight but sturdy metal  and fits in my hands great! It has a nice wrist strap so you can't drop it on your toe if you use that. Theses no need to change the bulb, led is the way to go! I took it camping  used for 1 hr and had full Power  still. I received this item at a discount for my honest unbiased review.",1
"When this hose arrived in the box I thought it was something else because the box was surely too small to hold a hose in it. When I opened it, sure enough it was this hose. It is able to shrink down in size and be packed tightly for small spaces.
I like the feel of this hose in comparison to a rubber one, and the best part is that it untangles a million times easier than a rubber one. It is lighter and a lot easier to wind up as well, in my opinion. I could see this hose potentially snagging when being dragged through a yard though, such as on a rose bush or something. The connector is great, and I like that there is a on/off valve located right at the spray end, so if you're using without a nozzle you aren't wasting water and having it just pour out everywhere. This hose has great stretch, although I do wish I had purchased just one size bigger (50') for my intended purpose. This hose also comes with a 1yr warranty under normal circumstances.

Tape has this smell to it that gets me dizzy.  Will not order these again.,0
"Wow these are some amazing goggles! I used to swim competitively, and I will first come out and say that these will not be best for that. These goggles only have one strap, instead of a split back. This means that it is great for a recreational or everyday distance swimmer, but not for fast, competitive, high-speed swimming and diving. They will surely let water in at some point if you dive incorrectly. That is not to take away, however, from the amazing design of this pair of goggles. I find the look to be very good while on me, while providing great vision and very easy adjustability.

There is also a silicon/etc coating on the inner lenses of the goggles DO NOT RUB THE INNER LENSES. This silicon prevents the goggles from fogging up. I made the mistake of using the wonderful microfiber towelette included on the inside of the goggles and I messed up all of the de-fogging material and eventually just rubbed it all off to clear up the marks I had made.

The goggle design makes it very easy to adjust the tightness. I find it to hold extremely well, but still be easily adjusted. How? I have no idea.

Overall, this is the goggle to go with. I believe it is unbeatable at the price, and comes with a wonderful case that is truly a nice addition. The nostril and ear plugs have not been used by me, but I did try them on and they did not feel uncomfortable. I personally like to hear the water when I swim, but if you like plugs, they will work great!

Fits true to size. Is very light and comfortable.,0
"Immediately upon receiving this item, I sadly realized it was not going to offer the protection necessary for my phone. While the design is very fashionable, it leaves NOTHING to actual FUNCTION of a protective case. This is more of a fashion statement than an actual insurance policy for your pricey device. Quite honestly, I did not even open the package. Everything I needed to know I could determine by inspecting the item within its clear packaging. I was not willing to risk my device by installing it. I am returning it for a refund. If you're extremely careful, and don't have a record of dropping your phone or like to change cases with your shoes, than I would say you would love to add this to your collection. On the other hand, if you are looking for something that offers protection and peace of mind from that accidental and occasional drop, this might not be the best choice for you. On the plus side, Most other cases that I have seen completely cover up the back of the phone , but this phone case allows you to see the actual color of your phone.

"This is our second Bentgo Kids box. My son used one last year for Kindergarten and absolutely loves it. It is the perfect size for a elementary age appetite. My daughter is starting Pre-K this year, and couldn't wait to get her Bentgo for school. She's more excited about taking lunch than actually going to school. Even my 10-year-old loves it and took it to day camp with him this summer (we had to add a bag of chips on the side to satisfy his appetite.)

After a year of use, our green box is still in perfect condition. It has been thrown, dropped, stepped on, and generally abused by a 5-year-old. The seals still work perfectly, the latch is still perfect. The whole thing works like new, and it really is leak proof! Never once has the sauce in the middle gotten into another compartment. It is easy to wash, and I haven't had any trouble at all with the rubber staining.

The only thing I would caution someone about when considering this Bentgo is it's size. It will consume all available space in a regular kid's lunchbox leaving no room for a drink. So, buy it anyway, but take it with you when you go shopping for a lunchbox!

Also, I highly recommend getting at least one additional tray. I love having an extra!",0
My item got lost in the mail originally so the manufacturer gladly offered to send a new one.  It has arrived and we are very pleased with it! The writing is clear and easy to read.  Great product and great price! Thank you!,0

"These containers stack up well. They are good for prepping food for the week.
I am awful when it comes to making food for one. I love to cook but I don't tend to pt the work into making food when it's just me. On my weekend when everyone is usual home, I can prep for my lunches for the next week. This is the first week I have had these and I have some good healthy lunches planned for the week. I can like how these containers are stackable. Both when they aren't in use and the tops are flat so they sit well on top of each other in the fridge. They are more durable than I thought they might be, but they are still thin plastic. I don't think they are worth the price. The first time I separated the containers it was a little difficult to get some of the bottoms to separate. But since then I haven't had an issue. This containers don't have dividers and have plenty of room for a meal. I do like this but would get the divided ones next time. I received this product for free for testing and reviewing purposes, and this review is based on my own personal experience using this product.",1

Absolutely fabulous! He looks like a million $... thank you,0
Only 4 stars because its not sheep's lined in the sleeves its nylon. I thought I would need XXL. I wear XXL In everything else but glad I got XL instead its a little too big but should shrink perfectly with 1st was. But its still worth the $60 it is very thick & warm & durable should last a while,0

"This was purchased for a runner to calculate miles during a run... Upon receiving the item, I was impressed with how the item looked, and how well it fit my wrist and how comfortable it was. It took a little bit of time to get the information onto the phone due to poor instruction. Once it was paired with my phone and the watch was working, it started right away with calculating my steps. Great! However, after taking a few steps, I noticed it counted more than what I had walked. I sat down at my computer to do a little research on the vivofit (should have investigated a little more before purchasing the item). As I was sitting at my computer, it counted from 33 steps, to 40 steps. I hadn't moved!!! When I got up from the computer, and before I took any steps at all, it said I had taken 9 steps. I discovered (I apologize if any of this information is incorrect, but it's information I discovered on the internet) that the this unit does not have a GPS. Therefore, if you want to calculate the distance of a run, walk, etc., the information will be incorrect due to the fact that it counts steps when you're not even moving. It's a nice product, however, it needs work.",0
"This was sent to me for free in exchange for my review.

I am a veterinary technician, and I can't emphasize enough the importance of  good dental care. Healthy gums and teeth really DO add years to the life of your pet.

Back in the olden days, the idea of brushing the dog's teeth was laughable. But dogs didn't live as long--we didn't know as much as we do now about diet, preventative care, and how dental health impacts a lot of other systems in the body.

Today, pets are living longer and they can enjoy a greater quality of life. Training your dog to enjoy regular brushing is a simple, cheap way to keep those pearly whites in great shape. If you can brush your dog's teeth daily, that's optimum, but a few times a week is better than nothing. Once the tartar mineralizes, a professional cleaning is necessary--being proactive will help cut down that expense. (Over the lifetime of a dog, you will have to have SOME dentals.)

the trick is to get your dog used to having his mouth touched, AND to have the right equipment on hand.

This is a good basic set. There are two ""finger brushes,"" which some pets prefer. The toothbrush itself has two heads, so you can use either (or switch off between both).

I am not using the toothpaste recipes. I prefer CET brand toothpaste. (I should say, I prefer USING CET, but you know what I mean. Although I did try the Chicken formula once--it left a weird aftertaste for DAYS! ) CET contains few additives and I trust the brands my employer practice carries. I would have liked to see this kit come with a list of veterinary endorsed products that would go with the brush kit.

Most dogs will tolerate and even enjoy tooth brushing if you make it fun for them. This will help you get started.",1
"I settled for this after having a hard time finding a teal or lime green bed skirt. I say settled only because I wanted a color. But for the price, it's perfect. It has the split corners so it hangs nicely over the bed rail corners.",0
I've purchased all of my additional cables from anker since I've found out about them. The powerline+ version of their cables is outstanding. The quality is superb. Don't look at any other cables.

"I have a 6 month 45 pound German Shepard mix and this crate is the perfect size with room to grow. She hasn't tried to break free yet, or at least if she has it has done its job. Where the sides meet it is a little flimsy but I just closed it up with a few zip ties and it's fine. However, that does make it a pain to take apart again if I want to move it.  Overall, very satisfied.",0

"These are very nice quality dress pants. They look classy, but the important part is that the material seems very soft and comfortable. With an adjustable waist band, you should be able to get the proper fit. I would definitely recommend these pants to anyone looking for something nicer for church or special occasions that your son won't mind wearing! Although the description says they are to be hand washed, the care tag on the pants says to machine wash in cold water. I received this item free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.",1
"I ordered these Batter Silicone Protective covers, for my husband to use with his bug out bag. He has several different items that uses the 18650 rechargeable batteries, and I figured that these would come in handy for carrying the extra batteries. So you get 3 of these battery covers when you order the set. They fit the batteries perfectly. Nice and snug, but not so much that you have to fight with them to get the batteries in and out of them. They are made completely of silicone, they are 3 inches long, and 3/4 of an inch in diameter. Each cover has a silicone loop on the top, for hooking them to your bag, for easy access. They definitely do the job they are designed for, which is protect your batteries and protect your gear, from the batteries. I have only one complaint, about these covers, as I said I ordered them for my husband's bag, they never asked me what color I would like when I placed the order. We received a pink, a white, and a purple, not exactly the colors he would like for his ""big manly bug out bag"". lol They are very cute colors, but again definitely not the colors he would of liked to have had. If FOXVAPE, would like a suggestion, give us a choice of colors. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and unbiased opinion.

"These are great headphones. The sound quality is fantastic, the Bluetooth is easy to pair and the magnetic earbuds are brilliant.

"I ordered this iCooker kitchen timer to replace my broken egg timer and it arrived well packaged within 2 days using Amazon Prime. This timer requires 1 AAA battery that is NOT included and then you're good to go. The timer can count up or down using the three buttons on the front panel, and has a loud buzzer that I was able  to hear from the farthest room in the house. The magnet on the back is strong  enough to hold the timer up on your refrigerator or other metal surface which saves counter space.

"I love these pants! I have Fibromyalgia and I am constantly searching for comfortable clothes as fabrics can really irritate me.  I have to dress in business wear during the day but the second I get home I change into comfy clothes.  I have been wearing these pants nonstop (except to wash them) in the evenings since I got these.  The color is such a pretty light blue and the fit is perfect.  They are thin so I personally wouldn't wear them in public unless I had on a long shirt because you can see every dimple in my legs and butt. If I had a better figure then I would wear them in public but that is my own personal preference.  They are plenty long, as I am 5'8 and they fall down to my feet.  The fabric is so soft and is perfect for anyone looking for a comfortable fitting pair of pants.  These are great for us girls with Fibro or other chronic illnesses.

"i have recently been getting into lace and this was the perfect piece to add to my wardrobe!

it is a three piece set including crotchless thong, bralette and a lace robe. all made of white lace.

the lingerie is very well put together. i only wear it for special occasions and hand wash very delicately.

the thong and bra are very true to size, and fits very well. the only issue i had with the bra is that my nipples did not fit in the slitted hole very well, but overall, still very cute.

another thing i wish i could change is the belt to the robe. the belt is not lace and it is made of some sort of polyester/mesh type of material but is very stiff and i don't think it matches the lingerie set very well. i choose not to wear it when wearing the set because of the stiffness of the belt.

overall very great product, it is perfect to spice things up and feel sexy. i think for what it is worth it is very good.

"Ok so let me just say, i was very skeptical about the hammock actually holding 660 pounds. I tested it out (about 550Lbs) with some strong durable heavy duty rope and it actually held 2 people on it. Im glad it worked and did not rip on us or anything. I love the color this hammock has. The material felt great on it and i had no issues with it. It came with its own personal rope and carabiners to strap. We had no issues with it at all. Set it up while we were camping and it worked great. The size is probably my favorite thing about this bag. Although, it is a really big bag it is still very portable because its very lightweight and has a little pocket attached to it where you can stuff it on and carry it with you. It was also very easy to wipe dirt off. Overall this hammock was built and made very well.

"I ordered and quickly received the Loose Leaf Tea Infuser (Set of 4) - Tea Ball Food Grade Stainless Steel - With Cute Hand Painted Charm - Make Your Perfect Cup of Tea.  When I saw this I knew I had to order, because my daughter-in-law loves her tea!  This comes in a nice retail box and each Loose Leaf Tea Infuser is stored in a foam insert.  This set comes with four (4) unique hand painted designs(charms) (two different cupcake designs, a teapot and a tea cup and saucer).  These are used best for medium to large loose leaf tea.  They are made of rust-free stainless steel. Easy to clean as well as dish washer safe.  She loves having a cup of tea in the afternoon and the loose leaf is her favorite way to go. She says she has other infusers but the quality is not that which these are.  The chain is very sturdy and the clip on the basket is super secure.  The Luvao Tea Infusers are cute, fun and best of all unique. I am very happy with what a wonderful product this is and She LOVES it!!  With my daughter-in-laws response I would highly recommend this set of Loose Leaf Tea Infusers by Luvao!.

"It turns out these aren't my favorite cooling towels.  I don't hate them---they still give you a handy vehicle for evaporative cooling.  As I've explained in previous reviews for different cooling towels, you could actually use just about any fabric: an old tshirt, a cashmere sweater, a tablecloth, prom dress...literally anything.  It's just that your comfort level would be lower because those fabrics would be heavy and soggy and drippy.  So this towel is an improvement over wrapping a drippy sweater around your head.....it's lightweight, and it gives you a lot of (micro) surface area for evaporation to occur.

But the spongey texture is slightly off-putting for me (though it may not bother other people) and fact that it dries hard and crispy like a piece of cardboard makes it difficult to deal with.  (If you've ever used a chamois leather on your car, it feels just like that.)  They say to keep the tube for storage, and to wait for the towel to dry, then roll it up and stuff it in there.  But it's not necessarily convenient to carry the tube around, nor is it always convenient to pack a crispy towel in your camping gear.

Again, I don't hate these towel---I think they're okay, and they're better than using a soggy hand towel or something similar.  It's just that I don't *love* them, and find the texture a little difficult to stomach.  I'm guessing some people might prefer this style over the soft, pliable microfiber type, but for me personally, if given a choice, these would not be my top pick.

"I love massages and I've been working out a lot so my muscles are ALWAYS sore.  The unfortunate thing is that my husband absolutely hates giving massages, so this is a lifesaver for me!  I am constantly rolling it on the floor while we watch TV, feels best on my back and legs but I've done my arms too and even my feet.  The foam is hard enough that it really gives resistance and you get some relief pretty deep into the muscle.  But it's soft enough that it doesn't hurt at all (except in a good way!).  It's really big which is awesome for larger body parts like my back, I can roll and roll over and over and really work out the knots.  Don't know what I would do to improve it, it's just a foam log but it works really well to relieve muscle pain.  Definitely recommend!

"Yoga blocks are great for when you need a little extra help maintaining proper form in a pose you just aren't quite flexible enough for yet.

The Yoga blocks arrived packaged together in a single clear plastic wrap.  After making a quick slit in the plastic wrap you will be able to easily pull off the rest of the plastic.  There is a small piece of paper that has the product info with the blocks as well.

I received one pair of blue Reehut yoga blocks.  The shade of blue on the two blocks is a deep and vibrant shade that will fit right in with the colors of any other Yoga blocks.  The edges of the yoga block are beveled so you won't have any discomfort while using these blocks from the edges. The Reehut logo is printed in white on one side of the yoga block.

The feel of the Reehut yoga blocks is that of a very dense foam.  It has a good feel to it's texture and will be easy for you get a good grip on.  It doesnt feel sticky either though, you won't have trouble shifting your grip around on these blocks.  Running your fingers across it you can feel a bit of smoothness for when you need to shift your hands yet there is still plenty of grip to the texture.

Its a very firm block.  The foam material it is made out of provides a good, strong, and sturdy feeling yoga block.  This yoga block will give you plenty of support for what ever pose you are trying to do.  While the material is very firm it isn't hard on your hands.  The material still has enough give to it to provide the right amount of softness so that it isn't hard enough to cause discomfort for your hands. The block will squish some if supporting a lot of weight.

These Yoga blocks are water proof.  This will keep them from absorbing your sweat and gaining a nasty odor like could happen if the material was absorbent. Water will run off of the yoga blocks in beads. If its just sweat you should still be able to keep a good grip but I wouldnt run it under a faucet and then go and work out with it.

I found the block to be very stable and sturdy.  It was able support me very well when I tried it with the yoga block both vertical as well and laying on its long side.  The block was able to fully support my weight as well and felt stable. Over all the Reehut yoga blocks are good yoga blocks and I would recommend them.

Packaging: Its the cutest darn packaging ever. Seriously. The bear is adorable.

Color of product/design: Black is fine with me. It could be more colorful, but I'm not mad at it.

negatives: It's bulky.

We were looking for something a little longer than the cord that came with the phone and I think the length is really good.  I was also looking for a braided cable hoping that it would last longer compared to other ones that have been used and deteriorate rather quickly. Months later I am extremely happy with this.

"I live in Southern California and we love to dress in beach clothes. When I saw this skirt, I loved how beautiful and flowy this was. I also loved the pink and white tones.

I would suggest to wear light colored underwear, as I tried these on with black ones and you could see through the skirt a bit. This has a little string belt for an accent and I love how 'fairy like' I feel when I have this on. The layers add a lot of texture to this skirt and this looks great with a white tank top.

"Guys, it's been a rough year here.  I don't know if it's because Gracie has hit the teenage years or if we've had trouble at school (through no fault of Gracie).  Either way, I've needed ""Mommy Medicine"", quite often.

The printing on it is awesome and fits my life perfectly.  The glass is perfect in quality.  The base is sturdy and that really helps so your drink doesn't ""fall"" over easily.

"They're really cute but they are very thin so it doesn't look good on all surfaces. I also noticed that the longer the writing is on the board, the harder it is to get off. I don't think I'm going to return them but I wouldn't buy them again.",0
"I was truly excited to get these pliers to field test and review.

I fish about 8 days a month, and more as I can. Often times it's more like 12 to 15 days all summer. I love to fish Popham Beach in Maine for Stripers and Bluefish. This kind of fishing requires rigging and a good plier cam make all the difference for me.

I use leaders on all my salt rigs simply because a lot of these fish have teeth and will cut line all day!

These pliers also feature a snap ring opener beak.......crimping jaws and a tungsten carbide cutter blade!

You also get a great sheath and lanyard to keep the pliers handy.

So far I have not been able to find one serious flaw.

"Received a sample pack of this soft white and a daylight color temp pair of LED lights. I have grown accustomed to the daylight temp LEDs already in my home, but this tungsten oriented color temperature no longer suits my eye.

For this reason and this reason alone, I docked one star for my preference. The bulb itself is great for its intended customers... that is, those who want to transition from old regular light bulbs to the (surprisingly bright) LED bulb technology.",1

"I purchased the Silver Black 3~10mm Stainless Steel Stud Earring Plugs Tunnel Illusion Round. This product was shipped in an envelope without other items. This was packed appropriately and arrived on time. I was impressed with the size, quality and weight of the earrings.
Pros:
- Cute and Classy!
- Bought them for the smallest size for the 2nd hole prefect size.  Could be worn in a 1st hole with the bigger earrings.
- Genuine sterling silver does not irritate my sensitive skin
- Nice quality velvet drawstring jewelry pouch in grey, appropriate for gift giving.
Cons:
- Long posts, I sleep on the side of my head and the posts poke me when laying down.  Again, another, plus/minus.

"I received the black band (25-65lbs) resistance strap and I love it.
It seems tough, durable and easy to work with.
Once comfortable and working on different ways to use the band I was able to in a short time exercise my biceps, shoulders, back and triceps. I will watch some videos online to see how you work other parts or muscle groups.
But I am very impressed with this band.

"I love this backpack!  I wanted a lightweight backpack to use while bike riding in the city.  The small zipper in the front unzips and then mesh net comes out to hold a bike helmet---brilliant!  This was the perfect solution for what to do with my helmet in the city!  The bag has been very durable and the nylon material is good at keeping my bag contents dry when its raining.  BUT if its really rainy there is a full waterproof cover that comes out and goes over the whole bag!  Aside from biking, this bag would be a good sized for a day hike as it could hold plenty of snacks, sunscreen, water and everything else I have to haul when hiking!  The zippers were all smooth and the side pockets were the perfect size for my water bottle.

"I had never owned an electric wine opener before and quite honestly until I tried this, I was completely satisfied using my tried and true waiter's corkscrew to my wine open bottles. However, it did not take long for me to become completely spoiled with the ease of use and speed of this opener. The opener will come with 4 rechargeable batteries (at least mine did even though the description says they are not included), which fit into the top of the unit. Just take the end cap off and look closely at the area where the batteries go and you will see the + and - signs for how to place the batteries before replacing the end cap. While I could use my opener right out of the box, it is recommended that you first charge the unit with the charging cord, that also comes with the wine opener. Simply plug the male end into the opener and plug into the wall. The red indicator light will let you know that the batteries are charging. To use this could not be more simple. There are two soft rubber buttons, one turn the corkscrew clockwise, the other counterclockwise. The advantage here is that once you place the opener over the bottle, hold down the button and remove the cork, you can then reverse the direction to discharge the cork into your hand. There is no twisting, pulling or clever wrist action needed to use this. If you can press a button, you can open a bottle of wine, which will be wonderful for anyone with painful hands or hands with limited movement abilities. You will also receive a replacement screw in case you should ever need it. To date, we've had no broken corks and the unit has never jammed. I also like that the screw is always completely enclosed in the plexiglass surrounding it so that nothing can get tangled in it during use. It also helps protect the sharp tip. My guess is that after you try this wine opener, the rest of the ones you own will all sit in a drawer. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.",1

"These shower curtains rings are exactly as advertised.  They have a stainless finish that has not rusted in the first week of use (will update if I run into any issues).  The roller balls on top allow these shower curtain rings to glide over a raised surface such as a shower curtain rod joint.  My previous rings would get caught on the shower curtain rod everytime, so these are a great improvement and much needed.

They also have the double hook on bottom to allow one to hang the curtain on one side and the liner on the other, another great perk.

"Since every waste basket pretty much serves the same purpose, I feel like the real difference in them is if they can bring a touch of style to your home, while still being functional. My husband and I love to travel and we love the beach, so much of the decor in our home reflects those two parts of our personalities. In fact, the reason this basket caught our eye is because it looks like a basket brought that would be brought home on our travels. This espresso color seagrass basket looks, smells and feels exotic. And since we are rather practical about recycling, we even used the bag it was shipped in as it's first trash bag, since, hey - it fits perfectly! The basket weaving is spot on perfect and the top is finished off nicely with no rough edges. The basket even has a decent amount of weight to it, so it will stay where you put it and hold up for the long run. I think the color would go with just about any decor and it looks great next to a desk, in a bathroom or bedroom. It will actually add to the overall look and feel of the room it lives in. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.",1

"I have done yoga for a few years now, but still consider myself a beginner.  I have a much better and consistent practice if I attend classes, rather than being alone at home with a dvd.  One thing I immediately learned in a class is that using a good strap helps immensely.  I am neither limber nor young, and a strap enables me to reach and hold a pose much more effectively and safely.  So when I was offered this product free with a review, I figured it would be worth trying.  It has turned out to be strong and well-made, and comes with a small instructional booklet.  The strap is a nice, soft material, a good long length, and adjustable.  I now use it for every yoga practice.",1
"The Zoozie LA Women's Maxi with Crochet Details is a perfect summertime maxi dress. The fabric is super comfortable, soft and breathable. It has nice drape and has some flow to it when you move around in the dress. The sizing is right on, I ordered a medium. I am 5'8"" and a size 8/10 normally and the dress fits me great. It goes right to the tops of my feet, which is great because most maxi dresses fall shorter than I like on me. The back detail on this dress really makes it different than any other maxi I own. The crochet detailing is gorgeous and the natural/off white color of the yarn used for it is nice against the color of the dress. I ordered this in olive green and the coloring on the actual dress is just like the picture in the listing. It was hard for me to pick what color to order because they are all so nice. I personally wash all my dresses on the handwash/wool cycle and hang to dry, but I think this would be fine in a cold or warm wash and tumbled dry on low. This is going to be one of my most worn dresses this summer. It is super cute by itself with the back detailing but also great with a jean jacket or cardigan over it for those chilly evenings or to dress it up a bit. It can be dressed up with heels and dressed down with flip flops.

"At first when I received the package I was pretty stoked to try it out. It came in a bubble envelope and the product is in a simple brown box. The charger is tucked away inside, so DON'T THROW YOUR BOX AWAY WITHOUT FULLY CHECKING because you can possibly throw away your charging device. Since the product is just in a box, I felt a little sketched out that the things I'm putting in my ears were touching everything in the box. It seemed as if the silicone buds that I was about to put in my ears were quiet dusty? I had to make sure they were wiped clean before I tried the earphones out. It pairs quickly and has a long play time. It's really convenient that it is wireless but the sound quality isn't there. I think my IPhone earbuds have a better sound quality. Another reason why I don't prefer this product is because they are quiet bulky in my ear. I wish they looked more sleek and incognito. For some reason the left bud does not fit as well as my right bud does (it could be my ears? But I don't have any problems with other listening devices). So since my left bud doesn't fit properly, my listening experience is mediocre because I can still hear all the noise I'm wanting to block out. I haven't tried any calls but I would imagine that my hearing aspect would be similar to my music listening experience.

"I already had a couple of these types of battery packs, but my new macbook charges via USB type-C and I wanted to get a compatible battery.  This one fit the bill.  It charges via either a USB type-C port or a micro USB port, and can output juice from the USB type-C or a standard USB port.  I haven't totally drained the battery yet, but the capacity seems to be on par with what's advertised.  The battery is a nice slim design, and fairly light for the high capacity.

A couple of minor quibbles keep this from being a five-star product.  First, the LEDs for the power indicator are all the same color and sort of bleed together, so it's difficult to tell exactly how much power it still has.  Second, the full USB port was visibly misaligned with the hole in the housing.  It works, but it isn't tremendously confidence inspiring about the build quality.  That being said, the price is quite reasonable for what you get.

Part of the reason we chose this Portable Speaker. With most of our time, lived out at the pool side, we needed to get something that we could hook up to our phones and laptops to play our music outside.  I had gotten a different set of speaker that hooked up to my laptop.  But they just were not loud enough to hear the music over all the kids in the pool and you had wires hanging out every where.  We chose the blue color to go with the pool decor.  Just love that you can do hands free phone calls over this speaker.  It comes with a built in microphone.
 Speaker comes with a Charger, Manual and Carry Pouch and a Aux Cord also. This device came fully charged and ready to use. Directions were clear and to the point. There is a power button on the side you just hold and it will power on. There is a clear blue light that lights to tell you the unit is on.  This light will also let you know by changing colors when the unit needs to be charged.  Unit holds a charge for about 18 hours.  Music was very clear and sharp on this speaker and we were pleasantly surprised at the sound Quality of this unit. Even at full sound volume the noise remained clear and crisp with no crakle or vibration noise. Very easy to sinc to your device. You double these units per the instructions for double the volume, but I can not see needing to do that.  This speaker has all the volume you could need. Came with a really nice velvet carry bag. There are buttons on the unit to toggle thru your music. We are very happy with this and would highly recommend this unit to anyone!

"As someone who has suffered from back pain for a long time, I had been hearing about the benefits of waist trainers and wanted to try one. I had originally ordered one, and had to exchange it. These run VERY SMALL!!! I ended up having to go up 3 sizes to get one that would fit. Once I had the proper size, I was very happy with it. The inside is flocked, so it's soft and doesn't pinch. The outside is a neoprene material, and it doesn't have a strong latex odor. I really like that there are 3 rows of eyelets for the hooks, so you can adjust and customize it for the perfect fit. This waist trainer offers excellent support and stability for people with back pain, and it is also relatively thin, so it isn't bulky under clothing. It also helps correct posture by keeping your back straight and in the proper alignment. I am really pleased with this Waist Trainer by Maxine!

"What an awesome gadget! Tongs and spatula all in one. I used these to not only flip the burgers I made but to grab them after they were done. The two pieces do come apart so you can use it as salad tongs or use for taking veggies out of a pot. There are little slots to drain any liquids also. The perfect tool to use at home or even camping or cooking out. Made out of a durable flexible material that should last a long time.

This is hands down the best charger I have ever had. It's compact, sleek, and comes with great ""extra"" features that most chargers don't have. I would highly, highly recommend this.

PROS:
1) It charges! That's kind of the point of these things, right? Well, it does what it's supposed to do.
2) LED display of how much battery life you have left. I have a handful of external device chargers, but none of them have this feature. I don't have to guess anymore about how much longer I can use the charger. It is clearly displayed.
3) Great price. For the quality of this product, the price is very reasonable. I actually think it is worth more than the current price.
4) There's a little flashlight. I have not had to use this yet, and don't really know when I would need to, but still, it is a nice feature.

CONS:
1) As of now, I have none. This external charger is pretty much perfect for me.

Now, as of writing this review, I have only had the external charger for a short time. So, if anything changes in the future, I will update this review to reflect those changes.

"I wasn't sure how this would work with my dog. At an estimated age of 10-11 years (unsure as I rescued her full grown)  she is as active as a pup one day and as slow as a senior another day. So, she walks well sometimes and really tugs other days. I tried it first on a day she was really full of pep. It worked out well! First off, it was comfortable around my waist. The fact that the leash part is slightly elasticized helps for when she would start to tug. It has about the give of a bungee cord. There is a loop at each end of the leash part. This allows for use with or without the waist piece, as well as for holding at a distance or for holding close to my dog. There is a little bit of bright green, which helps to make us a little more visible when walking at night. However, I still use a light for night walks.

"Having 4 school age kids, we go through a lot of pencils. Mechanical pencils are usually the best bet so you don't have to worry about sharpening them, and really that is what my kids prefer. This set of pencils is very nice. There is a variety of colors. The pack comes with extra lead and erasers as well, which makes life simpler.

The pencil itself has a nice grip. The soft foam where you hold it is more comfortable than bare plastic. I also like the refill button right on the grip. This way you can push out more lead as your  write and just keep on going. I know these pencils will get good use at our house with all of them in school. I would definitely order these pencils again for my kids (and even me!) to use.

"There are a few of these folio style iPhone 6 Plus phone cases around. This is probably one of the best of the bunch. The differences are really tiny, but end up being pretty important for everyday use.
This is an excellent folio case. My phone looks like a wallet with the cover closed. There is a magnet that gently holds the cover in place when it is closed.
Inside the front flap are slots for credit cards or ID. Which makes it perfect for a night out and not having to carry an additional bag. The material on the outside is like a vinyl which I actually love since it will make it much easier to keep it clean. I like the soft suede material on the inside of this case.
Here's where this case wins over all the others - the plastic phone holder. The edges on the holder are just slightly shorter than the others. If you have one of those screen protectors that goes all the way around the rounded glass - great news, they will work with this case. The issue is really millimeters - and this case just makes the cut to not interfere with any screen protectors.
The cut outs are even better, again by millimeters. They deepened the cutout for the Lightning and headphone connectors. Now virtually any size connector will work. The cutouts around the volume, power, and vibrate switches are angled so they don't poke you finger when you use the buttons.
It is reasonably easy to snap a phone into and out of the holder. I change phone cases fairly frequently, and I like that this one is easy.
The opening for the camera is large and allows the flash and camera working uninterrupted.
Of course for taking pictures you have to leave that front flap flying in the wind. It is a little odd to use at first. I've gotten used to flipping the cover out and tucking my hand behind the hinge. I've come to really like this method of holding my phone while taking pictures. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for a fair unbiased review. However I would recommend this case to anyone looking for the folio style",1
"This 7"" Mid-Century Modern Tapered Legs are fantastic! They are sturdy, well made, and gorgeous. They have a bolt in the middle of the top piece to screw into whatever you are looking to build.

Especially ikea furniture. ;)

CON: none!

"The USB port and HDMI port don't work at the same time, though the product description says it can do so: ""... allows you to connect your type C supported computers to the devices with HDMI port A!!!N!!!D!!! other devices with USB3.0 port."", which is absolutely not true on my XPS 13. The USB port only works when HDMI unplugged, then what's the point of buying this expensive 3-in-1 hub?

Even if it is designed to provide only one port at a time, it still doesn't meet the need, cuz the monitor goes black randomly when connected to the HDMI port.

"I have been looking all over for a decent WHITE sports bra, and surprisingly I have not been able to find one that had padding also.  I love that this one has a cris-cross back also!  I was nervous about buying one online without being able to try it on first, but it fits perfectly!  It is really comfortable, which is another plus being as some of the sports bras I have tried on have been really uncomfortable.  There is no tugging on this one to keep it in place or having to pull it down all the time!  It is very soft material.  It is not itchy or irritating, which is very important too being as I will be doing a lot of exercising in this.  I won't be able to do anything high impact in this, but that is fine being as I did not plan on anything like that anyways.  I am happy with this purchase.

"I ordered this headlamp because I thought it would be great to take with on early morning hikes when it's still pretty dark on the trails, especially because I happen to be pretty clumsy when I can't see where I'm going. Anyway, I loved that it showed up with the batteries! (Saving me a trip to the store.) The band is great quality, stretchy, and has an adjustment part so it will definitely fit any size head. It's comfortable to wear, too. The light is easy to switch on and you can cycle through the light settings by clicking the green button until it's on the option you want: bright, dim, red, strobe (white and red), and off. My favorite aspect of this headlamp is that you can adjust where the light is aiming, from directly in front of you to more towards the ground (without blinding you.) There's four adjustment clicks that you can make.
I had this in my car all ready to take on my next morning adventure when my car broke down. It was getting late and I called my boyfriend (who thankfully happens to be a mechanic by trade.) We discovered that this is a GREAT headlamp for car issues. It packs a ton of light and made it safer since I wasn't standing in the road trying to maneuver my cell phone flashlight for him. I'd recommend that everyone get one of these for their roadside kits.

"This is a really pretty tunic.  I ordered it mainly because I needed to something to throw on after exercise class when I still wanted to run errands but not expose everyone to the sight of me in tight workout gear.  The tunic length is perfect for that and the wide front pocket is handy to tuck my keys and wallet into.  The color is a very cool red.  It does fit somewhat snugly vertically though.  Not necessarily a bad thing because in a way the tailored fit (if there is such a thing when it comes to hoodies!) is actually slimming.  However, if you are well-endowed in the breast or belly, you will probably want to order one size up.  I was able to purchase this at a discount price in return for my honest and unbiased feedback and review.  Other than maybe adding and extra inch or two in the girth to fit larger women without being baggy on slim ones, I wouldn't change a thing.  I know I will get a lot of wear out of this.",1

Other than that, it is a nice looking canvas bag with a leather-like handle (I don't believe it's real leather). Thereis a really cool design to it with the dip in the middle of it to allow more arm space while carrying it. I also like that it has an interior pocket, and the inside is a darker color.

"Perfection!!  Exactly what we needed!  Sturdily built; priced right; super bright light for the small size.  Bought 4 - Love the ability to turn them on and off with the little pin included - we put one on our deck, but didn't want it coming on, etc if we're sitting outside enjoying a summer evening.  We put two others above each of the windows on the garage end of the house to help discourage vandals.  The last one is going on the front porch for those random times when someone might stop by without us knowing ahead of time, as we never just leave our front porch light turned on.  At least they won't be standing in total darkness waiting for us to answer the door!",0
"Did not meet my expectstions. Sorely disappointed.

"This swimsuit was not a lightish pink pink like in the picture.  I realize that there can be some color variation due to monitor settings, but this thing was neon pink.  I'm a 5'5"" and size 16, and the XL fit fine overall.  However, I have to return it since it was way too short in the torso area, even with the adjustable straps fully extended.  I did really like that the two straps on each shoulder can be adjusted individually.  The reason for 2 stars instead of 3 is that the chest area is really thin and you can see the padding and wires through it.  It's a bummer because overall the suit was pretty and was a flattering fit besides the petiteness issue.

"Cool camera, easy to operate, easy to mount, well thought out, I love the touch screen. Issues:  I went through three high speed cards before I found one to work right.  Beware, there are so many fakes out there on ebay and such.  Battery life could be better too.  That's it, fun camera for the money!",0
"I have owned multiple selfie sticks (all lost them or broken somehow), and this is the most complete package so far. Probably a little bit an overkill for me. I also had one very similar to this, but many times, the arm spins as I put my phone into the holder, so I needed to make sure the arm is in right place where it does not move. I am happy with this one - the arm is pretty sturdy and does not spin around even with a heavier phone as long as you make sure to lock it by turning it little bit to the right into the locking position. It also comes with a tripod  its little bit unstable with the stick as the weight is too high up, but works fine itself if you have the thing that holds your phone attached to it.

Pros
- Complete set with a tripod, a remote, and a selfie stick
-Very sturdy material and sturdy arms
-Comes with tripod that can work by itself if you have a phone holder available (you can screw them right it: it should fit universally)
Cons
-The selfie stick is little bit too long when folded, which makes it hard to carry around
-You need to screw two bolts to assemble

"These Beat Claws are so helpful and awesome when it comes to dinner time! We BBQ a lot and they really help when it comes to shredding pork to make our pulled pork sandwiches! I used to use two forks, but now with these it makes it a lot more fun and quicker to make our shredded meat! I had to put them right into the dishwasher when I opened the box because it did have cardboard dust all over them, but they easily straddled the top rack in the dishwasher, and came out nicely. I'm excited to have these in our kitchen!

"Before buying this shower speaker, I was a little hesitant because there were some negative comments about the volume and it's integrity against water. But because there were many who were happy with it too, I decided to give it a try... and I am glad that I did. I am very pleased with this purchase for reasons more than one. Let me share some details.

1) It looks very good and it is as it shows in the picture.
(2) It is water resistant.... meaning that it does withstand the little droplets here and there from splashing in the shower and it does withstand the moisture build up in the bathroom from the warm water. Nothing beats being careful too so just position it where it needs to be... far from direct water as it is not waterproof and near enough to reach it when you need to like when answering a phone call or adjusting the volume etc. After showering, I do take a piece of paper towel and wipe it... just my way of TLC for it.
(3) The volume is marvelous. TIP: make sure that your music source is at maximum and simple control the volume from the speaker itself. Otherwise, if the source is at a minimum you will not be able to make it any louder from the speaker volume adjustment.
(4) The signal / reception is superb! I have uninterrupted music flowing out of this thing even when my phone is a good distance from it. The phone works well too. Clear conversations both ways. I have used a more expensive bluetooth speaker before wherein I had to take my iphone IN THE BATHROOM for it to have uninterrupted feed to the speaker! Frustrating! So I am sticking with this blue baby :))
(5) To turn it on was a little puzzle for me but I got it figured out... press the power button and you'll hear one beep / sound. Don't release... just keep pressing and you will hear a series of beeps / sounds... that is when the speaker is on. To turn it off is the same way.

(6) Battery life is very good. I can only put it this way... I charged it 4 hours prior to initial use as the instructions said. I have been using this daily for 2 WEEKS now and have not charged it again yet. (5) The sound is superb! I am well pleased all in all.

I was given this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review and that is exactly what this is. I have no ties to this seller or manufacturer. I am not getting paid for this review nor has the seller tried to convenience me to give only a positive review. I knew just as much about this product before purchasing it as any other buyer here. I know buyers have been seeing a lot of these disclaimers in reviews lately on Amazon, and I've seen other reviews stating these reviews are fake. I honestly can not speak for other reviewers, but if they are anything like me i assure you they are giving as honest of a review as anyone else and they usually have better detail reviews than anyone else so please don't skip over them thinking what they are saying is not true. You have to realize I spend several hours of my own personal time to test and review these products so the last thing I want is people passing over my reviews just because they believe it to be fake.",1
"I ordered and received the white, king size pillow cases and I am very satisfied with the quality, and they even washed up very well.
The material is a cotton 60% polyester 40% blend, they are nice and soft and wash and dry well. It says they are used for hotels and medical but I just use them for my home pillows and I don't really see what the difference is.
Nicely packaged, arrived quickly and was wrapped appropriately for shipping.
The white is a true white, they are a crisp clean look and my pillow pattern doesn't show through the case, it is thicker good quality.

Can't go wrong if you need thick white pillowcases. Would definitely buy again even without my discount. I give this a solid 5 star rating!

"I really can't say enough great things about Mighty Paw products!! First impression right out of the package is ""that is DEFINITELY real leather!"" the smell is unmistakable and awesome! It also is buttery soft! It's flexible and soft so it won't dig into pup's neck. The stitching and riveting are great quality and look great. There are 5 holes for great range of sizing. A D ring works perfect for clipping on a leash. Truly a great buy for a quality product and I highly recommend Mighty Paws to any pet owner!

"Me and my hubby used this yesterday at festival for the first time.  I was unsure that my 16lb Doxi-pin would go for it.  Well I was wrong, he loved it and loved not being on the ground with all those moving feet.  The quality is beautiful sewn material.  I can see this will last for a long time.  I highly recommend this to all dog owners probably dogs under 18lbs, mainly because of the weight. I received this at a discount in trade for an honest review.",1
"I have been using several different iPhone mounts in my car that connect to the air vent. I like those that attach that way since they say out of the way of other parts of the dash or windshield. I recently went on a trip and forgot to take along my car mount for the rental car. I went to Target in hopes of picking up something. All they had was a huge clunky mount for $30. I thought of Amazon and realized that ordering a mount from there might be a viable option. I found this magnetic mount version that also attaches to the air vent and ordered it with overnight shipping for about $11. It works really great!

It came with two plates. One has a self adhesive for those not using a case. Peel off the paper and stick it to the back of your phone. However I use a case on my iPhone so I used the other plate. It has soft self on one side to go against your phone, between the inside of the case and your phone, protecting it from scratches. Yeah... smart design! This mount is minimal, yet it holds the phone strong and works very effectively and perfectly. The magnet holds the phone fine through bumps in the road, turns, etc. If you have a heavy charging cable that you want to dangle from it, there may be a problem with the phone sliding off the magnet but I don't think most people have a heavy cable. They are all thin and relatively light and will work fine. I have a short coil charging cable and it has no problem of this nature. Placing the phone on the mount is so fast... just pop it on or off when leaving the car. No clamps to deal with! One handed operation. I love it!  You can rotate the phone horizontal or vertical. Being a magnet, I had concern for how it would affect the phone. My iPhone 6s works perfectly fine so far. No negative impact of the magnetic field on the phone electronics.

TIP: when inserting the mount into the air vent, if you find that the mount fits over the vent fins loosely, try rotating the mount prongs 90 degrees. The 4-prong slots are not all equal distance from each other. The slot is wider in one direction than the other. I first inserted the mount and it was a little loose. I rotated it 90 degrees and inserted it again and now it's tight and solid. I also suggest putting it on the bottom fin so that the mount can rest on the bottom of the air vent opening, adding extra support for the weight of the mount with phone on it.",0
These are an exact replacement for the originals. These extra chargers are great to keep in my gym bag and the car.  Its always great to have extra chargers around especially when you get them for such a great cost. At this time the chargers seem to work great and just the way they are supposed to. I haven't noticed a difference from the original chargers. I do wish they sold different color chargers so my children didn't fight over whos was whos.  But I fixed that with some colored duct tape!  Lol!  I do also wish the fitbit chargers were just a little longer.  I know that this is the normal size for them but I wouldn't complain if they were longer.  If someone was on the market for new chargers for their Fitbit I would recommend these!  I was provided this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

My umbrellas break and snap and aren't sturdy enough to take on the Philadelphia Winds (especially during winter). This umbrella is for sure strong! Literally scared me when I opened it because it was so powerful that I did not expect it! (As shown in the video). I love how all I have to do is click the button to open it and click the same button to close it. Makes it quick and easy to run into and out of buildings. The only thing I struggled with was fully closing the umbrella you have to push it down and because the umbrella is so strong it takes some strength.

I highly recommend this umbrella because of its tough long lasting material and its durability to strong winds and heavy rain. I received this product for free for my 100% honest opinion. I highly recommend this umbrella.",1

"Up until last summer, I had no idea what a hot spot was.  One of my dogs got one, and he was miserable and wouldn't leave it alone (at first I thought it was an insect bite).  I used some hydrocortizone spray on it, but when it seemed like it wasn't healing, I took him to the vet, and learned about hot spots.  I purchased this all natural soothing hot spot spray from Buddha Dog in the hopes that if they come back this year, I would be ready (and not have to run to the vet!).  I didn't have to wait long, but it wasn't my dog!  My sister called me a few days ago and told me something was wrong with her dog.  It was a hot spot (i'm not sure why all of a sudden we are getting hot spots when we never had in the past?).  She's been using the spray on him, and it seems to be helping him.  Hopefully he will not need to go to the vet (our vet office is  AMAZING but is 45 minutes away!).

"I live in Florida and basically wage a war against mosquitos all year long. I have spray, bracelets, large candles for when we hang out outside but somehow it never seems to be enough. I wanted these in particular for my laundry room. Most of the houses near me all have the laundry room outside. It's nice because the dryer doesn't heat up the house but a pain anytime you need to do laundry around dusk. 5 bug bites in 5 minutes is unacceptable.

Once I got these, I put them in little votives that I had hanging around and then put them all over the laundry room. I only light the ones by the door, and even then only when I'm in there (obviously) but I'm pretty impressed with how effective they really were. Even unlit, thye fill the small room with the scent of citronella. Once I light one or two, there appears to be a do not cross line where even the light won't draw the suckers in.

I will say that simply due to their size, I wouldn't rely them completely outside, say for camping. At least not alone. They work for me because they're shielded from the wind on three sides and their scent builds up in the room even when I'm not using them. If you're going for a big area, use the candle in a bucket and maybe have a couple of these around for mood lighting and a boost of citronella.

"I love the Bepei company and their products.  There is something about their fabric that is just so soft and comfy.

What I Ordered:
Black Short Sleeves Scoop Neck Shirt in size small. I am 5'4 120 pounds and it fits perfectly. These are definitely true to size.

Unboxing:
Shirt came folded in a clear cello bag and the hang tag is attached by a piece of thick string.

First Impressions:
Super soft and the color is nice and dark.  I ordered two different styles of this same shirt (one was scoop neck and the other was V neck) and just like the other one, it was terribly wrinkly.  Like I mentioned in my other review, most of the time when I receive shirts from Bepei they aren't too wrinkly. However, this one definitely had some wrinkles. This wouldn't normally be a problem but in order to iron it, you have to place a towel or some other fabric over the garment so you don't mess up the material. If I were to lower the heat to use the iron directly, I wouldn't have been able to get out the wrinkles.

Pros:
Fits great
Covers tummy area
love the asymmetrical design
it is NOT see through at all

Cons
The wrinkles! It was really hard to work them out of the neckline area where the fabric comes together in the center.

Suggestions:
I always wash my Bepei shirts on the gentle cycle with low heat/tumble dry to keep them looking nice as the day I bought them. I think they will last much longer this way and will keep them from getting those annoying little pills (also known as bobbles) Pills are those small ball of fibers that form on a piece of cloth from washing too much.

"I'm a very busy stay at home/homeschooling mom of eight little ones all under age. We are always looking for new and easy storage ideas. We're also fixing to make a move to a new home. So when I came across these while searching, I knew I had to get them. Upon arrival I was very pleased with them. I ordered the brown to give me something a little more neutral and I couldn't be happier. They are actually a dark coffee brown, which is absolutely perfect. They are made very well, and have so far seemed to be very durable. I love that they are washable. If anything spills on them a wipe with a wet rag will remove almost anything. They are super easy to assemble, which is always a huge plus. You unfold them then place the square bottom in, done! They are the perfect size for shelving units, or closets. They do hold a decent amount of things if stacked correctly. I wouldn't put anything too heavy in it as the sides may bend a little. However that's when its very heavy, don't be worried about them not holding up. These can withstand the rough housing an throwing by all my kiddos, that alone says enough. They also have handles on the front which is great for closet tops or other smaller areas. They are presentable enough to use in literally any area. I'm so glad I found these, I highly doubt I could ever have enough of them. I'm completely happy with my purchase an I will be recommending them to my family and friends. I have no doubt in them lasting a while to come, being they are made so well. You will not be upset with these, I assure you.

"I have been needing to take my cats to renew their rabies shots, but our old pet carrier had been ruined so I decided to purchase this one.  First thing, it is soft sided so the top will not stay up unless it is zipped on both sides.  This makes it a little difficult to get your cat/dog or whatever pet you have inside.  Now it wasn't extremely difficult, but it would definatly be easier if the the roof wasn't caved in while you are trying to put them in because it would probably scare the pet less.  If you have 2 people available, which is what I had to do, then it will make it a little easier, because one person can hold the top up while the other inserts the pet.  If your pet is very small, like a baby kitten, then you can probably open the zipper on the front where the mesh is and put them in that way without the top collapsing.  My cats were too large for that which gets me to my next point.  The small carrier is just that. SMALL.  My cat is 14lbs and I literally felt like I was stuffing him in there.  He had no extra room whatsoever!  My 8lb cat fit in there better, but still very little room.  If I were to purchase again, I would go with the large size.  One thing I really like about this carrier is that the bottom of the inside is removable for easy cleaning.  The cover of the bottom can zip off and be washed.  The carrier itself is well made and even though a little small, it will work for quick trips to the vet.  I was able to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1
"So excited about this bag! I've been searching for a replacement for my worn, plain black woven bag which is about the same size. It's big enough for a laptop, a large wallet and a few notebooks. Pretty much everything I need. Black was getting so boring too, and summer is just around the corner so this white with a thin black stripe is perfect. I'm not a HUGE fan of the sailor look, so I removed the navy anchor (cuts off easily) so now it's a basically a white bag, with tan straps and thin black stripes. Just the way I like it! It's going to match with all my black dresses! Another huge plus is that it's a VEGAN bag, all manmade materials so you can feel good about toting it around. Bonus is that right out of the bag it has kind of a strong industrial smell which is keeping my cat from chewing on the straps. Normally as soon as my cat sees a new bag I know it is doomed to have kitty teeth marks all over it ASAP. This bag looks sturdy too, like it will hold up to me tossing it into the car in a hurry. Or on the couch. Or on my desk at work. Oh, also it's great that it stands up on it's own! It has 4 gold mini discs on the bottom for feet that anchor it and keep it from falling. Love a structured bag! Thumbs way up so far. I received this bag at a discount for an honest review. Super cute!!",1

"The good:
They fit the device perfectly, and it holds snugly in place (no wobbling around in the case).
The band fit was in line with that of other bands I have tried.
The display is clear and easy to read.

Opportunities for improvement:
The set I received included the orange, navy blue, and light blue.  The orange was completely discolored, with splotches of blue and black all over it.  It was completely covered in splotches that are very unattractive, and will not wash off.
The material of the band is a bit more rigid than other bands I have tried.  It feels more like plastic and less like silicone.  It is not a ""soft silicone"" at all, at least not compared to other versions of ""soft silicone"" that I have experience with.

I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate, in exchange for my unbiased review.  Based on my experience, with the specific product that I have received, I am hesitant to recommend this set of bands.  They are a fairly good deal for the price, and if you are less concerned with it being a completely soft product then it is fine.  If the softness is important, then another option may be better.",1
"I'm very pleasantly surprised with how well these bracelets work at keeping mosquitoes away. They also work wonders for keeping away other pesky flying insects such as sand gnats. I live in Southeast GA, and the mosquitoes and gnats are terrible...especially at dusk, and especially when you're around the river swamp, lakes, ponds, creeks, etc...My husband and I wear the bracelets and we can actually enjoy fishing in the creek behind our house and sitting on our back porch in the evenings without being attacked by swarms of gnats and hundreds of potentially disease carrying mosquitoes practically picking us up and carrying us away. They do smell a little strong, but not as bad as many of the sprays that are on the market, and with these bracelets, your skin doesn't feel all gross and sticky and they keep the insects out of our hair, which is something sprays and citronella candles haven't ever been able to do for me. They're made of 100% natural ingredients and are completely DEET free, which definitely adds to their appeal. I just wish I would have had these bracelets when my sons were younger and were playing baseball, because they desperately needed them back then. I'm very glad that I've discovered them and that they work as well as they do.

"The hammock is a good buy at the price point it is listed at.  However, there are definitely high quality options with you are willing to spend more.  I have an Eagles Nest Outfitters (ENO) - DoubleNest Hammock which I own and used sparingly for about 4 years, but I LOVE it.  This hammock exceeds my expectations but falls short of the ENOs quality which sells for more than double the price.  It comes with two ropes to hang the hammock with which are approximately 5.5 feet long, which saves you from having to buy it which costs around $5-$10 for 11 feet of rope at your local hardware store buying rope by the foot.  For my ENO I have two 12 ft nylon webbing straps, which work great and I like the extra length to give me more hanging options.

Measured dimensions: Approximately 90 inches by 52 inches

PROS:
- The colors (orange/grey) are great
- Looks nice
- Comfortable
- Comes with two ropes (~ 5.5 feet long)

CONS:
- Pouch stitching isn't great, could begin to fall apart sooner rather than later
- Ropes tied to carbineers where loose and required hand tightening

In summary, the hammock is excellent for the price.  The long term durability of the hammock is up for debate.  If you want one of the best hammock on the market the ENO brand would be a good choice, but if you are looking for nice inexpensive alternative this is good choice.  It would be very difficult to find a better hammock at this price point.  I gave it 5 stars because it really is a nice value for the cost but it isn't the best hammock on the market.

Best water bottle ever. I drive for a living so I fill up this water bottle at the start of the day and at the end of the day the ice is still in there from the morning. I fill it up with ice water when I go to bed and still have ice water in the morning. I'm pretty sure this water bottle ignores the laws of thermodynamics.,0
"I am a US size 4 and I ordered this dress in a size small.  The dress fits well and I love the color.  The material is like a ponte knit material.  I do wish that the material was a bit thicker because I will need to wear spanx underneath but the cut is flattering overall.  It is maybe a little low cut in the front and depending on how conservative your work place is, you might want to put a camisole underneath, but if you don't mind showing a bit of cleavage, it is not scandalous.  On me, the skirt comes right to my knees, so it is not overly short.  I also like that there are pockets in the front which are convenient.  Overall, it is a cute dress that I plan on wearing to work.  I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1

"My lower back and derriere are thanking this cushion so much right now.  This is exactly what I have been needing to use while creating artwork.  I either sit in a computer chair at my desk, or on the sofa in my living room while I draw.  The computer chair doesn't have much cushion at all, so I would find myself constantly switching my weight from one side to the other to prevent my rear from falling asleep.  This cushion helped immensely, and I can sit perfectly comfortably for much longer now.  It has helped correct my posture too!  On the sofa, I would sometimes feel myself slowly sinking into the plush cushions, which meant I didn't have much support there either.  Using this seat cushion on the sofa has helped to prevent me from sliding down into that cushion void, and like my results with the computer chair, I have found myself using better posture on the sofa as well.
The cushion is made with a memory foam core, and a mesh cover that can be easily removed and washed.  The memory foam is just the right balance between squishy and supportive, and feel amazing to sit on.  The hole in the middle of the cushion is a big plus, since it allows for more ventilation.  The shape of this cushion is excellent, and can fit a variety of shapes and sizes.  Very, very happy with this!

"I am having a couple of parties by the pool this summer so I wanted to flare up the backyard. I am so glad I found these because they were perfect for wrapping and draping 4 of our trees that line the very back! They were so easy to assemble and work perfectly. All you have to do is set up the solar panel in direct sunlight, set up the lights how you want, and bam your work is done! They are just the perfect brightness, suttle but still plenty bright enough to see. I did receive these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. If you're looking for some fun, low maintenance outdoor lighting I would highly recommend these!

Now let's get down to business. Before I get to the details, These pillow covers are FREAKIN AMAZING. There is no exaggerating going on. This purchase has been one of my most exciting. It has been much more than I expected.

=====UNBOXING=====
Package was well wrapped without any damage. The pillow covers were packaged well and was placed in a ""heavier"" ziplock bag. I believe when sellers put a lot of thought into the packaging, it means they care a lot about their product.

=====PACKAGE CONTENTS=====
Heavy Ziplock bag
2 pillow covers

======QUALITY======
The quality of these covers are so much more better than I expected. They are soft, beautiful, and unique. The details of the embroidery are sown neatly and beautifully. I hope in the video you can see how awesome it is. Also the zipper is Invisible/Hidden as is describes.

=====CONCLUSION=====
I am very pleased with this order. These pillow covers are my kind of thing. I really love nature and anything that is unique which I feel it lives up to that expectation. I definitely recommend these and I know others will love it as much as I do.

"Upon opening the package I was initially a bit disappointed with how thin the blanket it. I guess I just assumed there would  be more to it than there is. It is more like 2 layers of tent material than an blanket. We took it camping with us and set up the baby play yard on it. The material held up very well, no moisture got through at all. The mat is a generous size, large enough for the baby play yard to be open to it's largest size with some room left over. When we were done, the dirt wiped right off without issue. Even melted red popsicle juice didn't stain it! The mat comes with 4 stakes and stake holes in the corners. I expected those wimpy tent stakes that come with most everything out there but these are way nicer. They are pointed to help you get them into the ground, and thick enough that you don't bed them by stepping on them to drive them in. I got the blue color, it's bright and happy. Perfect for the park or a picnic. I am so happy that I found this mat. It has a permanent home in my truck for whenever we need it.

"This is a gorgeous passport case. It has two sleeves inside for the front and back cover of your passport along with card slots inside where you could place other identification including your divers license and credit cards while traveling.

The case measures 5in x 4in and is a deep navy blue with the etching ""PASSPORT"" and below the eagle ""United States of America"".

See the attached pictures for more detail. My passport fit perfectly inside and I now have piece of mind that is will be protected not only when I am traveling but also when the passport is in storage. It is a beautiful case and a nice touch of elegance. It is not cumbersome and will fit anywhere your passport previously fit.

"I am in love with the thinness of this screen protector. Most of the glass screen protectors these days are .3mm and that just makes it that much more annoying to press the home button with a piece of glass surrounding it, but this 0.2mm glass screen protector just makes it that much more bearable. I like my phone feeling thin and excellent to use and this glass screen protector does exactly that. I had no problems installing this screen protector and I feel like most of the glass screen protectors nowadays are not that hard to install to begin with. There are the standard accessories included and installing it should feel like a breeze. However, there are no flaps that are there to help you install the screen protectors unlike the Spigen branded ones that do have the flaps. The flaps make it a lot easier but nonetheless, it is not that hard to install the screen protectors to begin with. I actually used around 3 tries to put this screen protector perfectly on my phone. If you mess up a little bit it is easy to just lift the screen protector back up and resume putting it on again. The only thing that you have to watch out for is that you have to do it slowly or else it will crack due to the extra thinness of this glass screen protector so it would be best to get it done in one try and just be extra careful that first time. The case that this glass screen protector comes in pretty premium as well with a hard plastic case to make sure that the product inside the case does not get damaged on the way it is to your house.

"I got tired of spending a ton on the official Weber grill cover so I have tried several of the off brands.  The Classic Accessories cover here seems to be more like  standard cover than a form fitting cover like others I have tried.  The material is similar to a thicker tent material.  Water beads nicely on it and it seems to protect my Genesis grill fairly well.  it is easy to put on due to how flexible the material is.  There are various straps that you adjust to get it to fit better and stay on in high wind.  The cover is very lightweight compared to the official grill cover so it gets blown around much easier.

While it does a good job covering the grill, I have to add that I am skeptical that this cover will last very long based on how thin the material is as well as what it is made from.  I have to be very careful not to get it caught on a corner as it feels like it will rip easily.  I own a different off-brand cover for my grill that uses a more canvas like material which is much thicker, heavier and forms better on my genesis grill.  The price is about identical to this one so I feel it is a better option in you want just a standard black cover.  If you want green or want a cover than can easily fit other similar size grills , this one will do the trick.  But again, I can't comment on how well this will last through a New England year with all the temperature changes.

For now, I went back to using the other cover made by Yukon for my Weber grill and moved this cover to my older Kenmore Elite grill which I converted to a charcoal grill.  This cover fits due to it's non-form fitting design.",0

"The previous wallet I had been using had literally fallen apart from heavy use so I was in the market for a new womens wallet. After seeing on the news how easy it is to steal someones card information and knowing that I travel a lot for work I knew that I wanted a RFID blocking wallet to keep data thieves at bay. I was also looking for a wallet that could stand up to everyday use and not fall apart like my last one. This wallet fits that bill. After reading all of the positive reviews, I decided to give this one a shot. Not only does it keep your cards AND your passport safe, its stylish and super durable.

Pros:
RFID blocking
Holds all of my cards & passport
Easy to clean
Super durable
Stylish
Uses zipper to close instead of snaps
Lifetime warranty

Cons:
The orange color on the inside. Not a deal breaker on this wallet but I wish it wasn't so bright.

Overall, I would 100% recommend this wallet to any woman looking for a new RFID blocking wallet. Im very happy with my purchase and I feel MUCH safer knowing that my information is being protected. I also love that IGOGEER stands behind their product by offering a lifetime warranty.

"Most Bluetooth receivers like this are $35 or more, and are pretty big and clunky. (I've tried a few, for an iPad install in my Ford Explorer to get the audio to my headunit)

This one is small, and I love the fact that it has the buttons on it to play/pause and skip/reverse songs. You can mount it in convenient locations like your center console to be right by your hand to change songs without grabbing your phone, or having to reach up to the dash.

I have a USB and an AUX input jack in my center console so I can power this device as well as plug the 3.5mm cable right in for my aux input and now have Bluetooth on an older stock radio with just AM/FM/CD.

I did not need to use the included ground loop noise isolator, but the fact that they include it is awesome. Most reviews of other adapters include the fact that they had interference coming through and had to order one of these on top of the $30+ adapter.

"I liked these Crossfit Gym Gloves from Fit4lyf3.  They fit real well and I liked the wrist strap for the wrist support.

"I am reviewing this product as the owner of multiple bearded dragons.  If you own a different kind of reptile, I am not aware of the needs of your pet and cannot speak for them.

There is a lot of controversy in the bearded dragon world when it comes to using Mercury Vapor bulbs.  I have talked to many people who are firmly entrenched in the fluorescent bulb camp and swear that Mercury Vapor UV Bulbs will cause bearded dragons to go blind.  I believe there are other extreme health complaints with regards to Mercury Vapor bulbs, but I cant think of what they are right now.  The reason I am so aware of these opinions is because I used to subscribe to this set of thoughts myself.  Until I did some research.

Mercury Vapor bulbs have both UVA and UVB benefits, while fluorescent bulbs have only UVB.  Mercury Vapor bulbs also add more heat into the bearded dragon environment than a fluorescent bulb does.  I have a basking bulb set up on a dimmer switch which I use to maintain the temperature in the vivarium exactly where it needs to be, but in the summer, when my house is warmer, the Mercury Vapor bulb maintains the vivarium at the exact temperature I am looking for all by itself.  (Lucky me.  Electric bill savings.)

As for the dangers of a Mercury Vapor bulb they are designed to be set up differently than the UV fluorescent bulbs.  The most popular bulb for bearded dragons is a Reptisun 10.0.  If you are using this bulb, then your bearded dragon needs to be able to get within 6-8 inches of the bulb.  If you switch to a Mercury Vapor bulb, you MUST redesign your setup so that your dragon is between 12-14 inches from the bulb.  That is a very big difference in distance!  And it is absolutely vital to the health of a bearded dragon!  Putting a bearded dragon within 6-8 inches of a Mercury Vapor bulb WILL cause health problems.  If you are switching your UV source, please make absolutely certain that you make the necessary adjustments to your pets home.

With all of that said I love this Mercury Vapor bulb.  And Skellington is absolutely thrilled with the new setup in his home.  He spends much more time pancaked on his basking spot.  Plus his energy level has improved dramatically (thats from the UVA).  This is a high quality bulb that is packaged very well.  The seller has included detailed information regarding how to handle your bulb and specific things to consider in setting up your bulb so that you don't have any problems with it.

In addition to the purchase of this bulb, I spent $1.47 on a ceramic fixture to house the bulb.  Removing the old light, wiring the new fixture, and rearranging the setup in my bearded dragons house took approximately 2 hours, but his home is much more comfortable for him now and I have seen a dramatic improvement in his colors and his demeanor ever since I made this change.

"I recently purchased the ""Kitchy Wine Bottle Corkscrew Set with Stand, Foil Cutter and Spiral Worm"".  I have always used the wing style opener and was finally looking to upgrade.  The Kitchy Wine Bottle Corkscrew Set seemed to be just the thing so I ordered it from Amazon.com and the set  arrived a couple days ago.

 I have had company this week so I used Kitchy Wine Bottle Corkscrew a few times to open wine bottles.  So easy!!!  No more putting it in crooked or breaking off a cork in the bottle.  (Yes, I am a Klutz.) It is also classy looking.  It even came with a stand so I can put it by my wine glasses instead of in my kitchen drawer.  This has definitely been an upgrade!

Conclusion:
If you want a nice wine bottle opener, try the Kitchy Wine Bottle Corkscrew set and you will get a nice set at a reasonable price.

"I received this as a free review sample. I own a number of grow lights in various sizes and from different brands. What they all have in common is they are truly effective. I mainly grow basil and cilantro, and prefer to grow mine inside because weeds have always been an issue in my outdoors herb gardens.  Suffice to say that I am a fan of any grow light, regardless of which brand.

What I particularly like about this one is the size. Many of my grow lights are much smaller and are better suited for getting a seedling started. This one is good for a fairly large pot (up to five gallons if you suspend this light a meter from the top of your herb or plant.) The suspension means that you will need a socket that can be raised or lowered so that when your plant grows the light can be raised to maintain a meter above height. You can be a little loser, but I have found that a meter is perfect for lights this size.

This light runs cool, so if you are using it in an enclosed space and you have more than one the thermal build-up should not be an issue. Some lights from other brands do tend to get hot and can (and will) change the room temperature in ventilated spaces that may hamper growth.

One factor that you need to take into account is this is a heavy light that weights in around a pound. It needs a sturdy suspension, and must be suspended vertically.",1

"I received this item quickly!  I am an Amazon Prime member and this did qualify for the free 2 day shipping.  There were other designs that did not have prime, so I am assuming that is why there are reviews that said it took forever to come in.

Another review said that the phone could not be propped up by the wallet.  I tried it after I put my phone in and it worked perfectly. See the pic.

This wallet holds the iPhone 5S perfectly.  I read some bad reviews on here that stated that the holes did not align correctly.  I attached a picture where I plugged in my headphones and my charger with no problem.  I also attached a pic of the volume button since that review also stated that the cutout did not allow access to these buttons.  There was yet another review that said the case is so tight it that it holds the power button down.  I did not have any of these issues, and I have the 5S that I used in the case I received.  I remember that the 5 is the same as the 5S so I am going to chalk this up to a.)  The seller reads the reviews and makes improvements based on these reviews, or b.) The seller reads the reviews and now has a more stringent QA process or c.) I just got lucky!  There were tons of great reviews as well though, and the bad reviews are mostly from last year, so I tend to think that the makers made some improvements, or those products that got the bad reviews were just bad apples...

That said, I did give this 4 stars because I didn't absolutely love it.  The PU leather does feel plastic like and not a soft leather, so I was a bit disappointed.

I would recommend this for a teenager or someone who doesn't need longevity and changes their wallets or covers like they change their underwear LOL",1

"So much coolness in a little gadget.  My husband loves to use his wedding ring for opening beer bottles but it drives me crazy!! So I decided to buy this in hopes he will use it instead of his ring!
The opener stands about 3 inches tall. It is made of nice brushed silver. It has a spring inside it along with a magnetic strip (I think that is what the cap sticks to). It is as easy as you would think to use it. Place on the beer bottle it fits nice and snug and then you push it down. I was surprised how easily I was able to push down and still get it to open!
Once you pop it open, the cap stick right in it, making for an easy discard over the garbage can. I am excited to have my husband switch from his ring to this opener!!

"Generally speaking, this cable is really durable and the design looks legit.

I am a big fan of cables, Apple lightning cables in particular as I love the convenience of having cables alway around so that I can give my iPhone a full load of battery. I have tried Anker, iLuv and obviously OEM Apple lightning cables. Anker is my best choice, even over the Apple original cable, because of its durability and power stability. However, I decide to try out new brand of MFI cables I Lumsing came to me as a high-review product.

If the brand is removed from the cable, there is no way I could tell whether this product is Anker or Lumsing. To me they are pretty identical to each other, not only in term of the design, but also the functionality. They are both decent for its purposes, charging and transferring data.

The cable is made of PVC - a durable material, similar to Anker's one. I haven't tested it for a lot, but will update this review if any problem comes up. It's strong and can handle forces pretty well, unlike the Apple cable, which is extremely vulnerable and easy to tear apart, especially at the two ends.

The only thing I have problem with is the packaging. It appeared to be opened and used right when I received it.

In brief, if you are looking for a subtitute lightning cable for your iPhone, probably you already knew that durability is the most important criteria to look for a good cable, Apple cables tear all the times no matter how hard you trying to keep it. Even though I still love to have Anker as my substitution as I have been using the brand for a while, Lumsing offers an equal durability and functionality compared to Anker, however, at a more reasonable price.

"I received this item at a discounted price for purpose of product review. However, my opinion and review are unbiased and should be read as such.

I received these shoes about 3 weeks ago now, and have had the chance to use them around 5 times since. They perform very well, and are a lot better looking than other water shoes.

Comfort
They're pretty comfortable shoes. They support the foot well, providing more arch support than other similar shoes. Nothing much to say here other than that they're nice to wear for an extended period.

Style
Better looking than most other water shoes *ahem* you know who you are.

Usability
This is the category I have a gripe about, and the reason these shoes lost a star. When walking on smooth rock or other surfaces that don't offer much grip, these shoes slide. Other (even cheaper) water shoes handle these situations better. At times I didn't feel as sure footed as I wish I had. Also, the holes in the bottom of the show allow rocks and stones to get stuck. That's only a small complaint though; not really that big of a deal.

Overall, I'd recommend these shoes to a friend and others.",1
"Coofit Stripe Leisure Canvas Top Handle Cross Body Bag Tote Handbags for Women Model A...

This is a well-made canvas handbag that has more than enough room to carry everything you should need on a road trip away from home.  The stitches are tight and I found no loose parts or canvas. This bag was well put together for easy of use it comes with a zippered compartment on the outside of the bag and one inside and the bag has a zippered closure.  It comes with 2 kinds of straps one is removable  with about a 9 in drop that can adjust easily. It can be carried as a tote bag, across the chest sideways, or just over the shoulder like a normal purse, and the other one is attached.

I used a stain guard on my purse to help keep it looking great and because I have kids with messy little fingers and the stain guard helps me out with that issue.  Then I just spot clean as needed with mild soap and a damp cloth.  I am happy with this handbag and feel that it will last for seasons to come.

"My interest in this particular case is the Ultra light weight that still provides excellent protection.  The case is definitely ultra light but it provides little or no protection in my opinion.  I paid a great deal of money for my iphone and would not put any faith in this case as far as protecting it from an accidental drop (which has happened to me on occasion).

The case IS very thin and looks nice on your phone!  My phone is my camera so I was unable to upload a photo or video but it truly looks as shown in the seller photos.  Not bulky at all and the material used gives you a nice grip.  I LOVE that about it.  The beauty of the telephone shines right through.  This case does also fit like a glove.  All holes are in the right places, no gaps anywhere and as I said before, the case looks beautiful on your phone and provides a nice grip, I just wish that it perhaps had a bumper or came with a tempered glass screen at least to provide some kind of protection because for me and my klutzy self, I cannot use this case as is and will now have to go out and purchase a shield for it.

If you are not worried about dropping your phone, then this case would be my #1 choice.  I love that it is not a clunky case, allows for a nice grip AND lets the beauty of your phone show.  I'm going to purchase a tempered glass shield and use the phone cover.

I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.,1
love these cups. Bought a set for my camper and liked them so much ordered another set for my home.,0
"First off I'd like to say this was bigger then I expected it to be. When I first received the package it was in excellent packaging. The magnets are nice and strong and the eraser works well as well as the pen. I hadn't had a chance to hang it because I currently lent my drill out. I gave it to my mother since she very organized and like to write reminders on appointments and important stuff. And I love the bottom tray part where I can get extra things and store it there most dry erase boards don't come with that. Overall excellent product.

Received this for review for my unbiased honest opinion.",1

"This swim buoy is really nice.  Before blowing up the buoy you can add all your personal belongings inside the back portion, just Roll up the end and snap it closed. The bouy is a bright orange and has their logo down the front and is black and red.  The bright color is nice for another boaters see you while in the water.  The bouy is easy to put together and the snaps are very secure.  Next you blow up the top part and close the top.. Add on the portion to snap around your waist and you are ready to go.  It also comes with a water proof case to hold your phone for extra protection.  The bouy is well made with quality materials.  I like the way you are able to put your things in it for safe keeping.  The water proof phone cover has three rolls of closures and a Velcro seal.  You can use your phones functions while in the case and adds extra waterproof coverage. The bouy worked great in the water and was able to float around comfortable.  I had it strapped around my waist and it fitted comfortably.  Taking apart the bouy was really easy... The cap can be pushed into the air tube and it releases the air.  Closed up it is easy to fold and store.

"*Update* the company reached out to be since I was not 100% happy and actually refunded my money.  I am very impressed with the offer and am hoping I just had a bad set of markers from them.
 I have jumped on the adult coloring bandwagon lately and needed some additional things to color with.  I ordered these because I liked that they were thinner than a traditional type marker.  I am happy with the size of the pens, I am able to grip them nicely but am a little disappointed in how they actually color.  The pens lack a little when it comes to actually working well.  They somehow end up with a balled up piece of ""material"" on the tip of the pen. I have tried most of the colors and they all did that.  I thought it might have been the actually paper causing it so I tried it with a different page but it still did it, so it must be coming from the pen itself. I doubled checked by using some other pens and I did not have the same problem.  The color does not come out smooth like I was hoping. It feels rough, if that makes sense, when coloring with these. I felt like I had to go over the color several times to actually get a decent coverage.  I really wish I liked these better because I like the case they came in and the feel of the pen, but unfortunately, the coverage just is not there for me.  I received the pens at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review, which I have given in my own words.",1
"spend a long time looking for this particuar model all over the internet.  i'm in the us, and this brand is from elsewhere.  they ended up on amazon a few months after i started looking, so i purchased the seat. the seat looks very sleek and modern.  the rack attachment is great, and worked flawlessly with my existing rear rack.  the seatbelt system is very easy one-buckle design.  the reclining mechanism works great and is very easy to reach while riding the bike.  this allows for parent to recline the seat without getting off when the child falls asleep.  great feature.

the suspension is an un-dampened spring, so it's a bit primitive, but it's better than nothing.  the only reason to take one star off is the shape of the upper portion of the seat.  when the child falls asleep, and the seat is reclined, the sides do not wrap around enough to keep the head centered.  a few times, my baby's head was slumped over to the outside of the seat because the area round the head is too flat in my opinion.  that area is also not cushioned with fabric, so the helmet makes contact with the plastic and bounces with imperfections in the road.",0

It works very well. It is very compact. It has a lot of volume. Worked very well in the shower. I have received this product at a free or reduced price for my unbiased opinion .,1
I purchased this from another vender as Amazon was out of stock on the beige set.  It fits perfectly on the new day bed we purchased for our granddaughter.  You can't beat the price...saw it as high as 139.00 on another site.  The cover is somewhere between cream and pale yellow and is of a good quality.  The gingham skirt and pillowcase are thin and needed ironing but look fine on the bed.  I like that it is not flowery or childish as we use this room as an office too.,0
"I was hoping it would be of better quality. It was a bit thin, but still durable however, it does not shape into a female body. This is more of a unisex shirt. Also, the print isn't as bold as I thought it would be (like actual merchandise you expect to get if you were to actually go to star labs), it's more of like a cheap knock-off that anyone with a shirt printer could make.",0
"My husband and I enjoy drinking wine and we live in an area that requires you to either bring your own bag or pay $0.10 for one of theirs. We have a bottle shop at the ground floor of our building so this is perfect for quick trips down stairs to get a new bottle or two as well as for when we go shopping and/or take wine to events with friends and family.

The neoprene hugs the bottles tight enough that you don't have to worry about the bottles shifting and the seam separating the two bottles prevents them from clanking together. This bag seems to be well made and we haven't had any issues in the few weeks that we have owned it thus far.

I often read the reviews posted by others when I am looking to make a purchase and I hope that my review has helped someone else to make an informed decision. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

"Not only was the seller super fast at getting me my belt, but I love the quality and fit of this product.  It sits perfectly on my waist and does not feel heavy or bulky.  My arms are not bonking into the water bottles and when I jog with it, it doesn't feel heavy or start to slip and the flap pocket stays nice and snuggly closed thanks to the great Velcro.  It fits my Galaxy 7  nicely with room to spare and I love how there is a hole in the back of the pack that allows for my ear buds to be plugged in without worrying about it going through the opening and possibly causing the flap to lift.  A very good product and for an awesome price.",0
I am going to give it a five star because the customer service is great! Turn your screen on a white background( Set screen timeout to 30mins) and line it up perfectly because it doesn't cover the whole screen . In other words there is a slight bit of white showing on the left and right sides of the protector so take the whole plastic off the bottom and line it up North South East and West to get it centered correctly.,0
"it arrived quick. Average packaging. its cute and compact. I really like the coloring. I give this thing a two due to the fact its 8 steps between my room and the bathroom and when I got  to the bathroom the darn thing said I took twenty one steps. It is very very inaccurate.

"I bought these bookends in the Natural color, and the pair I received are a lovely blueish gray color instead of the pictured brown.

I figured I'd find something similar on Amazon. Ordered this one for $45. The shipping estimate was 12-20 business days, but it arrived just over a week after I ordered it. It's small and very light when it's in the carry bag. The first time I tried to inflate it, I had a lot of trouble. Went to YouTube and found a ""how to"" video. With the correct technique it's super easy. I'm lounging on it right at this moment in the park, and couldn't be happier!",0

"These lemon wedges loose leaf tea infusers are so cute! I am in love with them! They hold the tea well and not many (if any) tea leaves come out of the small holes.  It stays a lot better on the cup than I thought it would! I thought it would just slip off based on the item picture, but it has enough flexibility on the stem that it will stay on my cup very well.  It is very easy to put the loose leaf tea into the infuser and I am not throwing it all over the floor in the process (like I can with some other infusers that don't have a big enough hole).

Big back pockets
Reflective tags on the back
Great colorful design

Cons
Material is not very stretchy

Good cycling shirt for the price.  It has three big back pockets for your gear, snacks, phone or water botte.

This jersey is 100% polyester.  It does stretch as much as other jerseys we have but for the price you cant go wrong.

"Last week I went on a camping trip with a few friends.  I have used camping hammocks before, but it had been awhile so I decided to purchases this hammock for our trip.  When we got to base camp I noticed I was the only one who had brought a hammock to sleep in.  The rest of my party decided to invest in tents.

If you had never slept in a camping hammock let me just tell you, you're missing out.  As my friends struggled with their tent poles, the finger pointing began and the blame for who forgot half of the other poles in the car started.

While all of this nonsense was going on, I opened up my pouch which was carefully put away in my pack and began setting up my two straps around a couple trees.  Within 4 minutes I had my hammock setup and had about 4 beers already bro crushed.

As we finally went to sleep that night I felt like a King among peasants; as everyone had to sleep on the ground I was snoozing away between two trees.

Pro's:
light weight, durable, all fits into one pouch, straps come with in, instructions are super easy to understand and they come attached to the pouch, can be set up and torn down quickly

Con's:
the only thing I didn't realize was a pillow did not come with this when I bought it.  There is a pillow pouch, but you must by your own pillow other then that this hammock is the real deal man.

Sorry for the weird info.

I have an elongated spine, which kind of sucks. If I sit for too long, it's painful. To make matters worse, I am in love with riding horses, but I usually have to go to my chiropractor to get realigned every month, and if I ride a lot, a couple of times a month.
Buying the padded equestrian shorts to wear under my breeches are around $150, and I've never done that because I thought it was an adsurd price.
I thought I'd give these a go, and holy comfort!!!!! My back didn't even hurt after doing a sitting trot for a good solid 45 minutes, which has never happened before. Ever.
These have the gel pads on each side of the buttox area, and makes riding a freaking JOY.
As for the compression, yes. They do that also, but don't make me feel like u can't breathe or am going to sweat more because I'm wearing them under my breeches.
These are true to size, ridiculously comfortable, and I am sooooo glad that I have these!!!! I would recommend these to anyone who has an elongated spine and still refuses to let it stop them from being active.

"I wear yoga type pants and capris most of the time.  I am on a weight loss journey and have lost a lot of weight, so I wasn't sure what size to order.  I ordered a large.  They came quickly and packaged in a padded envelope.  When I opened the package I thought there is no way these are going to fit me.  Well I tried them on and can tell you I didn't take them off.  They are the most comfortable pair of yoga pants I have ever worn.  Because of my weight loss I have a little extra skin on my stomach and these pant just keep it all tucked in nicely.  They give me a nice waist line with out having bulging of muffin top. They have a very soft comfortable feel to them.  They are seamless which is very nice.  I have found that when I'm doing yoga I always having to adjust my pants, well not with these pants.  They stay right where they are suppose to stay which is very nice, I can concentrate on my yoga practice and not my pants. I would highly recommend these Magigaga workout pants. And for the price you, why waist your time looking for anything else!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  I will be buying more of these for sure!",1

I really wish I had not waited so long to make this purchase.  I LOVE this cooker.  Very durable and easy to get started right out of the box.  So far I have made multiple HUGE batches of chicken wings and some of the best stir fried dishes you can imagine.  Stir fries need that high heat that I can't get from my traditional stove.  Also love the fact that I won't be heating up the kitchen so much this summer.,0

"This is a really cute weave of fabric.

I was lucky enough to be given the awesome opportunity to purchase this item with a discount on this product in order to provide an honest and unbiased review of the product, in my own words with only how I feel about it, not an inflated review. As such, I do tend to write reviews as honestly as I can, but I also know that because I was able to receive the product at a discount, that that may bias my opinion of the product, so I tend to try to imagine that I had had to pay whatever the full price was for the product at the time I made the purchase, rather than a smaller amount based on the discount, so basically imagine that I did not get a discount, and base my review off of that (sorry if that was confusing). I am hopeful that that helps with the bias and makes my review a more accurate tool for judging the worth of the product, rather than just something that people gloss over and ignore because of the ""I got a discount"" disclaimer at the bottom of the review. As a final addition to this disclaimer, I try to base the length of the review solely off what I feel needs to be said about the product, so some reviews will be quite lengthy and wordy (kind of like this disclaimer), while others will be short, sweet, and to the point (like when the product just straight up works or is just awful - there's only so many ways to say that).  TL:DR - I got a discount, but tried to not be biased.",1

"The Prestige Thermal Insulated Blackout Curtain is great quality at the price.

We found that even in peak sunlight, the room stayed quite dark (picture of darkness attached :) ).  It also keeps a lot of the cold out of the room on a cool day.  Some insulated curtains have a different color on the back to help block the sunlight, but these are the same color on both sides (which is quite nice).  We went with the burgundy and like it quite a bit.  I would certainly recommend this product if you are looking for a nice quality insulated curtain.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.  It is definitely a quality product and I would recommend trying it in your home.",1
"I love these lights! They make my walkway and driveway tremendously more visible at night. Not only that, but they look amazing. These lights were very easy to put together. I didn't even need to look at the instructions to do so. It is a mix of metal and plastic pieces. Everything sticking out of the ground has a very nice polished metal appearance. The plastic light cover was beautifully made. Only problem I had with the lights were a couple of them had bad batteries. But that was a very easy fix.

"Since I'm EBF, my bra ranges from a 34D to 34DD throughout the day. I ordered a large and it's a comfortable fit. You will not be able to adjust the fit, so be sure to get the appropriate size as you put it on similar to a sports bra. The description says its tag free but there is a tag in the bra on the side that can be cut off if it bothers you. The material is a soft cotton stretchy fabric very similar to a Hanes type of cotton underwear. I slept in it and it remained comfortable throughout the night. This bra does not come with any padding but has pockets to insert pads if you'd like. The straps are wide and offers appropriate support for lounging around the house or sleeping. It's very convenient for night nursing as you just pull the fabric to the side for baby to latch and pull the fabric back into place once baby is finished. A lot easier than the annoying clips. I received this product at a discounted price for a honest review and I hope it was helpful. Overall, I'm happy with this product.",1

"These gloves have a nice thickly padded leather palm. The seams are sturdy and well reinforced. I use them for a number of purposes. Whether lifting weights or using hand tools which hurt my hands, these have just the right amount of padding to protect my hands.

"Nice little case!
1. The fit is great.
2. It has a sleek appealing design
3. It has a nice texture easy to grip
4. It's clear so I have the protection and the appearance.
5. All of the ports and buttons line up which is great.

Arrived earlier than expected and fits the Galaxy S7 Edge nicely! I've reviewed several cases on my search to find the right one and have come across many that I liked and they're all different. This one isn't bulky like a lot of cases I've tried and that's something I was looking for. The backing design of frosted glass is classy and not too over the top. I tested out all the buttons and screen features and they all worked perfectly with the case on. The case doesn't have that gummy texture you get with all silicone cases, which is another thing I was looking for. It's not gummy, but it also doesn't feel like it will slip out of my hand. It's easy to get in and out of my jeans pocket and the raised lip around the camera is added protection. Overall, it's a great little case for the Galaxy S7 Edge and if you're looking for something slim, sleek, and classic that isn't flashy, then I'd recommend this for you. It also comes in three color options so you can customize to your own specific style. I did receive this product at a discounted rate.",1

"I was excited to try my first pair of wireless headphones, but I was disappointed with this pair. I will say that the build quality seems high, so I'm not going to worry about them falling apart anytime soon. They also connect very easily to Bluetooth devices, but other than that, these really aren't great. They are uncomfortable in the ear, which automatically makes for an experience that's not ideal. But then, the quality of sound with these headphones is poor, which is obviously the most important part of the product. The sound is muffled and not crisp at all, and it really makes you want to take them out and listen to content some other way. If the sound quality was better, this might be a decent product, but unfortunately it's not.

Overall, these earbuds are of poor sound quality, and when that is present, nothing else really matters. If you are looking for a cheap set of Bluetooth headphones, look elsewhere.

I love that it has two wheels inside that go round and a round when the color beadlets hit the wheels. Super Z Outlet has a few different colors you can select from when ordering. I just happen to like the color blue, and so I ordered this one.

As you can see the color drops hit the stairs and then drop onto the wheel slots. As the wheel slot fills the wheel turns. It is very calming to watch.

"The swimsuit itself is very cute. It was a little smaller than I expected when I ordered my normal size.  So, I will have to wait until I loose a little weight to wear it.  At this point, I am unable to tell how well it wears and stands up to normal wear and tear because I haven't been able to wear it.

"I am not sure why others say that this does not hold 14 oz, because mine does.  This is such a nice cup.  My son loves camping and he loves hot cocoa.  This is a great mug for him.  He is able to take it outdoors, drop it and do what boys do and its stays in great shape.  The only negative that I would give is that it does get hot on the outside while holding it.

All in all this is a great mug for the price.  The look is very industrial and is pretty close to indestructible since it is stainless steel.  I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for the industrial look or that is looking for a mug that is sturdy and unbreakable.  I did receive a small discount when purchasing for the purpose of product testing and leaving honest and unbiased feedback.  This in no way affected this review or my opinion of the product.",1
"This is the 2nd light bar I have bought and my review is the same as the first one I left. It is a wonderful light bar! I bought this light bar for my Jeep Wrangler. I drive a rural road everyday. After six months, the light bar is flawless. I have never sealed or otherwise made adjustments to the product and installed it right out of the box. The light bar has been hit by tree limbs and brush, been through storms and continues producing light without a problem. I have a few friends who bought more expensive models. My light bar far outperformed every single one, and I spent a fraction of the cost. I would gladly recommend this light bar to anyone looking to get more light on their truck.

"These storage units are durable and fit nicely into most nooks and crannies in the home. I use these on the shelf in my closet to organize items that were once haphazardly thrown up there to get them out of my way.
The non-woven polypropylene units are 11 inches high, 10.5 inches wide and 10.5 inches deep. The lining of each container gives them a shape that is hard to distort and a uniform appearance. The handles on either side make it a breeze to move filled containers. In one I store my hair styling tools that I don't use every day. In another, I store linens. I believe these containers are best used for light items and in areas they won't be too heavily abused. These containers work wonders for me but may not be as useful if they take a beating from your two- year old every day. They are a great addition to my room at home and I see them as being a great addition to my dorm.

"This 13"" by 120"" gold sequin table runner is exactly what you need if you are adding a little bling in your life.

The seams are all machine stitched and very secure. Upon opening the package none of the sequins were left in the bag nor did fall off when I shook out the table runner. This is a good thing and something I experience mostly anytime I deal with sequins.

Since it is only 13"" long I was able to wrap it around my gazebo for a very special dinner. Wish I had a photo of that because it was gorgeous.

You can fancy up any banquet table with this runner or do as I do and use it as a back drop for photos. It is perfect to pack in my camera accessory bag.

Great table accessory for under $10.

"Ive never tried any of these grill mats in the past but decided to give this one a shot. They actually turned out to be pretty useful and Im happy I went for it. They made cleanup a breeze and I can now imagine a broader selection of foods to cook on the grill with a lot less setup and hassle.

The non-stick surface was great and didn't offer any issues during the cooking process. I was able to clean them fairly easily, although Id say that the sooner you clean them the easier it will be (thats probably obvious, I never said I was smart).

The included Basting Brush is a nice little add-on as well. Probably not needed for anyone whos already been cooking out on the grill, but it really doesnt hurt to have an extra lying around.

Im quite happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone for use on the grill. I did not give these a try on the oven, as I simply don't have a need for it so I cannot give an honest opinion on that feature.

You NEED your own battery.

I love these type of adjustable flashlights. They are very helpful when you need to focus a beam on a small area or light up your whole yard.  This light is rated at 1200 lumen, now I don't have a way to measure the lumens it puts out but its just as bright as another that I have thats rated 1200.  By the way 1200 lumen is BRIGHT.

Now the light is made of Aluminum alloy so you don't have to worry about any plastic.  It has a small carrying strap that will fit around your wrist.  The power button is a bright green. (Its not illuminated)  The beam is focusable and goes from a small square to big enough to light most rooms.  The light also has 5 lighting modes.
1. High (Very Bright)
2. Medium  (Bright)
3. Low
4. Fast Strobe
5. SOS signal

It Runs off of either 3 AAA batteries with the included holder or an 18650 battery with the included plastic sleeve.  (Batteries not included)  How long the light will run for will depend entirely on what kind of batteries you use and how strong they are.  That said an 18650 in the 2900-3400mAh should last longer than AAA batteries and its rechargeable.

I attached pictures but they don't always show up but everything is in the video anyway.

If you have any question please don't hesitate to ask. Ill be more than happy to help answer any question if I can.

Please note that I rely on reviews posted to help me decide on buying products too and hate buying junk. If a product is bad I will rate it as such.

"I love the ease and convenience of this little coffeemaker.  I use it almost daily for my travel-to-work cup of joe. My only complaint about it is the filter basket -- if you use more than one scoop of ground coffee, and don't use a paper filter, you will end up with grounds in your coffee.  And I'm NOT into cowboy coffee!  (I like my coffee a little stronger than one scoop will provide, so I use two, which is perfect.)  So.... I purchased a box of the filters that are ""suggested"" with it on the product page.  They indicate that they are for the ""Javajig"", but I assumed (wrongly) that since they are advertised with this product, they would fit. Nope -- too small.  I've made them work by placing one BETWEEN the filter basket and the solid plastic filter holder cup, but it's not really a fit. I still end up with some grounds in the cup. Not sure if there is another filter that might fit this machine - and I don't want to purchase the soft coffee pods, because, like the K-cup type, they produce coffee that is too weak and watery for my taste.  It's a great little machine, but I'd like to see them improve the functionality of the basket and/or provide a paper filter option.",0
"I was very satisfied with the X-DNENG Solar Charger. The first thing I notice when I opened the package was it has a very durable feel to it. The belt clip with the compass is a nice addition that doesn't come with other power banks. My wife and I love the dual USB output as we take this with us to the pool and can charge both our phones. The solar panel is nice to give your phone a little extra boost if needed. It states in the product details that the solar panel is not a primary source of charging so I wasn't expecting it to. Overall I am very happy with this power bank and will be recommending it to friends and family.

"I absolutely love it. The material is soft and comfortable and the way the fabric drapes/hangs looks super flattering and elegant. I am actually wearing it at work right now with a long scarf and have received many compliments. The fabric is a little thing, but not see-through. I am in between a small-medium (I'm a US size 4-6) and think the small is perfect. I ordered the wine colored version in a medium which may end up being too big but we shall see. Overall, love this dress.",0
"This is a perfect little shoulder bag. I use it for school when I don't feel like carrying a regular sized book bag. I love the pocket on the shoulder. My iPhone 5s fits perfectly in there.

"This product did not work for me. After picking up 36 pairs of shoes numerous times, I finally threw it away.

"I spend most of my day at a computer and I do a lot of typing. I'm very lucky that I haven't suffered any major issues at this point, but know that I could. I've never really used a wrist pad to assist during my day, but have really enjoyed using this one. It's quite a bit better quality than a lot of the ones I've seen in office supply stores. The PU leather seems to be durable and the cushion is enough to keep my wrists elevated to the level of my keyboard. I really like the length of it, too. Some wrist cushions are very long and this one is just long enough for your two wrists. It doesn't take up a lot of space on my desk, which is also a big plus for me.

Nice product. It is water resistant but not waterproof. I would buy again. I did not receive this product for a discount to review. This is an honest review from a full price buyer. If I could change anything I would like it to be waterproof.,1
"I have a pack of ShetlandSheep dogs. Three to be exact. If you know anything about the breed they are in the herding group. Herding and barking is what they do. Having just one for years was tolerable but not with three if one barks they all bark then they get my big dogs barking. At times it's maddining. I am a big animal lover and didn't think I'd even remotely consider a colar like this but I'm despart get the barking undercontrol the only other options for barking is surgical and that's not really a option for us.

I will admit I've heard horror stories about dogs getting hurt and testing this collar on them cause me a bit of anxiety. So I tested on my husband ( gotta love him ) volunteered to be the tester. It worked like it was supposed to. He barked it gave a warning he repeated it repeated the third time he bark it made him jump. He said it feels like a poke in the throat and that was at level 4.

We then tested it on our dogs first turned down to the minimal setting. This collar works with each continued bark the shock gets stronger up to #7 then pauses for a minute and recycles starting all over again.

I have defiantly seen a big improvement in two of my dogs the other one is stubborn and is scared to death of the collar so we are taking a different approach with her.

I like this product for its different uses however it only picks up 2 or 3 radio stations and they go in and out.

"I ordered these Strappy gladiator shoes for use in various summer outfits this year. The package arrived slightly misshapen, but inside the box both of the shoes were well packed and in good condition. These sandals look great from everything. I've used them with shorts, dresses, and jeans and they always add a little more oomph to those outfits. The main problem I have with these sandals is that for me they get a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours because the shoe is pretty narrow. Overall these shoes are a great product, and I would definitely consider getting another pair in a different color (maybe the gorgeous white ones I keep seeing)!

"This is a wonderful desklamp that is way more efficient than halogen or incandescent desklamps.  The desklamp is already assembled, so there it is ready to use out of the box.  The base/stem can bend forward backwards a lot, and the stem/neck can also bend forward/backward.  Finally the lighting element can rotate along the long axis, all this essentially means you can target the light any direction you want.  The touch controls are very responsive and I love the different color temperatures of the light depending on your application.  Overall, a pretty well built desklamp.
Please note that I was provided a sample for my honest and unbiased review.",1
For the price you can't beat these. One of the caps didn't sit correctly and they advised me to try some plumbers tape and if didn't work they would make it right. I was happy with the advice and the remedy worked considering the price. Would reorder again.,0
"I honestly was not sure what to expect from this machine. I had never heard of Sous Vide before getting this machine and I will say I am pleasantly surprised with what it does. The idea is to cook your food at a lower temperature for a longer period of time helping to evenly cook the inside without burning the outside. You simply place your meal in a vacuum seal bag with a bit of olive oil, Place the bag on the rack in the bath at the desired cooking temperature and time, Remove the bag from the bath, open and serve. Some of the reviews state that the water circulator is loud or does not prime up right away. I have only used it twice and while it is a bit loud I had no issue with it priming right away. It does require a vacuum seal to get the best results, but you can use ziplock freezer bags as long as you keep the temperature below 165 degree. Also do not let the bag touch the bottom as it can melt the bag getting oil in the water. This sous vide machine is a substantial value at at least half of the cost of its competitors.

Overall I give this water oven 3 1/2 stars. The price cant be beat, The food is amazing, But you do need a vacuum sealer for best results. I recommend this for someone just getting in to Sous Vide and not sure if they like it as it comes in at reasonable price.

"So far, I give this snorkel an A+!  I have tested it in the pool, but not yet in the ocean with waves happening, which is why I used the term ""so far"".  It is well made and feels  durable.  The mouthpiece is much more comfortable than some that I have used!  The part that clips to your mask is well made and holds onto the straps of the mask very securely.  The top appears to be designed to not just take on water into it, but like I said, I still need to test it in the ocean in a few months.  I will update my review after I have used it in more environments.  I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.

I love the color Black Pink tie Dye. The Swimsuit cover dress is not only cover but i can wear it as a dress alone. The material is cool and comfy.

"GREAT Value!

My dog had already been trained on the more expensive indoor systems to not go down the hallway, so perhaps that's why that area works, but she runs right through the second barrier at the front door.

These headphones are actually really nice. I ordered the black ones but was sent the white and light blue ones. That would be the only problem I had with them. Other then that they charge up pretty fast and last a good amount of time too. They fit my ears comfortably and they aren't heavy so they don't weigh down on my ears. The sound is amazing to me. The bass isn't too loud and the treble is perfect. They fold nicely to fit in almost any bag. Perfect for everyday use and even traveling. They came with an audio cord too.

"This reviews for high-quality sports headband with non-slip grips by shine athletica I really like this headband. I use it primarily for when I go to the gym to keep my hair out of my face I ordered it and the coral color which is beautiful.

"This pan is just okay.  It cooks kind of strange, when it heats up, as the food will stick but then of you work with it will release.  But what I dislike most is how hard it is to clean around the bolts on the inside of pan.

Very poorly designed.",0

"I have a Comcast provided router and service.
Like many other people reporting problems with loss of internet,  every few days, I had to manually power cycle the router (Shutting off and re-applying power). I installed this device (by the way quite easy to install) with the hope it would be a solution to my problem .Today, four days after I installed it,I experienced a loss of the internet  (wifi connections) just as before (no internet connection to the  computers; loss of functionality of alarm cameras, etc.). The ezoutlet automatically sensed that internet connection was down. It automatically turned off the power to the router and automatically turn the power back on to the router.  A few minutes later, everything was back in service just as if I had done the procedure manually. Hopefully, it will continue to work like  this.
It is definitely a useful device, particularly if you are not home for an extended period of time and you continue to need the internet working while away.  I am thinking of alarm systems which rely on the router for monitoring purposes and broadcast for example pictures or the premises that you are monitoring.",0

"I hate this phone with a burning passion.  It's really really reeeeally slow,  laggy,  and constantly kicks me out of things.  The thing that irks me most is that the majority of the time it doesn't alert me to new text messages,  so I end up missing important texts.  This is every day. I have to physically open conversations in my text app (stock) on a whim, periodically, to check for messages.  It doesn't even show up on my icon that I have any messages.  Yes,  I have tried other apps,  but they work for a day or so,  and then I have to change my mms settings. It's truly annoying and frustrating.  The speakers are horrible,  and I had to download a speaker boost app just so I could hear a conversation.  The camera is pretty nice,  which is it's only redeeming quality.  It takes forever to load or back out of it, though, so I don't take as many pictures as I would like. I have never ever complained about a phone.  If it isn't great, I just suck it up and use it until it dies, but I really want to hurl this thing against the wall.  I miss my HTC desire 816. It moved onto cellphone afterlife.  ",0
"I purchased the hot pink medium collar for my cavapoo who is about 16 pounds.  I am really happy with the collar.  It is nice width for her size and it is nice and thick. It is made from a thick durable nylon and has nice heavy duty plastic fasteners. The collar was also easy to adjust, which is a plus.  Very happy with is color and especially love the hot pink color.  I received this item in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  All opinions are my own.

"What a great idea! I am so glad I came across and purchased the Tera Armor - 3 Ring Pack Men's Silicone Wedding Ring Wedding Bands. I purchased the bands for my husband since he is unable to wear his actual wedding ring when he plays golf or works out. The rings arrived in a small little plastic bag inside a padded envelope. Very simple packing. I was worried the rings would be too tight because my husband's finger measured as a size 10.5, but we ordered the size 10 and the bands fit perfectly! The bands stretch just enough to fit his finger without being too tight, but tight enough that it will not fall off. He has worked out with the ring on and he said it did not bother him at all and stayed put the entire time. I love that the pack comes with three different colors and that there is no design or branding on the actual rings. I am curious to see how long these bands with last, but they seem pretty durable and will be perfect for when we go on vacation this summer. This way he can't lose his actual ring in the ocean! While I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, all opinions are my own and I would definitely recommend the Tera Armor silicone wedding bands to anyone.",1
"I wear a size 9 shoe, I ordered these in a size 9.  The fit was as expected with no problems.  A Very comfortable shoe. I like that they were not flat they have just a little lift.  Hot pink is my color and these were truly Hot Pink and very very cute. I wore my Zhuanglin Women's Quick Drying Aqua Water Shoes while cleaning our deck and outdoor lawn furniture my shoes got extremely wet/soaked.  As advertised they dried shortly afterwards (83 degrees today) ready for round 2. Lol.  I noticed I did not slip on the grass like I did in my sandals. The Aqua Shoes were packaged in a reusable clear plastic bag. Which works excellently as storage.  Hmmmmm, now I really need a pair of these in black.

This arrived on time and as expected.  When I opened it I was impressed with the quality and craftsmanship.  It is made from a super durable heavy duty foam. I love that it is so long it really allows me to get maximum stretching and massaging. I work my legs and even my back with this. I immediately noticed the difference after using this.  I would recommend this to a friend. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  However I would happily pay full price and am glad I got the chance to try it.,1

"im only gonna say pros and cons

pros:

my system:

4770k @ 4.2ghz
16gb 2400 mhz cl11
samsung evo 850 500gb
xfx xtr 550w

1) outstanding performance, my 144hz monitor appreciates it, great perf jump coming from a strix 980
2) great looks
3) aura lightning software
4) good oc potential (dont get mad if you cant get more than 100 mhz out of the core, remember it is already oced as hell, its a 1506 mhz chip), mine does 2100mhz, did not touch mem frec much, just tried 9000mhz and it went ok.
5) 0db fans if you're a silence freak, in my case fans are always at least at 30%
6) price, 450 sounds pretty good to me, not that much money for the performance you get

cons:

1) size, doble check if it fits your case, i managed to put it in a obsidian 250d with a 3mm clearance from front (as you can see in the pics)
2) if you're a temp freak like me and want it to be under 60 c all the time fans cound be a little noisy
3) 1/10 coil whine at night with no ambient noise, by 1/10 i mean almost imperceptible, and only in some scenarios
4) a little and almost imperceptible rattling fan noise from one of the three fans and low rp,
5) asus tweak utility won't let me manualy set the fans under 40 % with a custom fan curve, had to use afterburnet in order to set it as i wanted

despite this cons, im so happy with this card, beats every game in 1080p 144hz (with graphics tweaking of course not every game in ultra settings but you can manage to get beautifull graphics at a high frame rate, over 100fps for me looks wonderful already)

if you don't want to spend that much money for a 1080 this card will make you happy for sure.",0
"So I have washed these 3 times now and they have held up great. The biggest concern for me with microfiber sheets is that they always bead up. They are incredibly soft, which is why I always go with them, but I think it is inevitable. With that being said these have been through the washer and dryer 3 times so far and are still very soft and SMOOTH. I have only had them for a short time, but I will come back and update periodically on how well they are holding up (they will be washed often, because they are on my toddlers bed). It is worth noting that they also fit really well, nice and tight (I hate loose fitting, fitted sheets). These stay on well and don't pop off the corners with tossing and turning! That's a HUGE issue for me! I have a standard size mattress so it isn't extra thick (I know that makes a difference). And just to discuss the appearance a bit, the color is gorgeous and it is nice that they offer so many options of colors, since most places have very few! The one thing I'm not completely in love with is the decorative stitching on the pillow case. To me it looks a bit cheap and it is unraveling a bit in a couple of places, not too noticeable, but I feel it would have looked better with none at all. With microfiber sheets I usually end up replacing them twice a year, so if these hold up for at least 6 months I will be very pleased, and so far it looks promising! As I said, I will try to update my review with more use and wear to give a better idea of how they hold up over time.

"This modem is working as expected. I bought my previous Motorola modem from my cable service provider and after about 5 years it was not performing the to the my current cable service's speed. Since the old modem saved me money by operating well for 5 years, I decided to buy my own modem again. If this one lasts 5 years I'll have saved considerably by buying rather than renting. With the new modem my downloiad speed went from about 65 mbps to over 300 mbps and the upload went from 4+ to 20+.",0
"First one we received cracked within two days of putting it on.  There were no air bubbles or debris caught under the glass.  The phone was not dropped or anything.  From regular use, the glass cracked.  The customer service was great and they sent a free replacement.  New glass was put on and then the phone was dropped from less than 2 feet onto a carpeted surface and the glass cracked.  I do not feel that the glass is of a good quality.",1

Well made case.  This case fits snugly on my phone without being difficult to put on or take off.  It doesn't interfere with a glass screen protector and is comfortable to hold with no slippery feel.  It's a lovely clear that lets the beauty of the phone shine through.  I received this sample for my unbiased opinions.,1
"I drive a Buick Enclave, in this car the iOttie CD mount has to be pushed all the way to the side of my CD slot because it is not tight enough fit unless it is all the way over. In the center it is wobbly and falls out easily. Thankfully iOttie recognizes this is an issue and includes a small black piece of plastic with the accessories. This piece needs to be used with CD slots such as mine to make the mount fit tightly. We have both a Buick Enclave and a Kia Soul that we tried this with and both required the adapter. DO NOT THROW THIS AWAY until you have tried to insert this mount into your CD slot.

Once the mount is fitted properly it works great. The iOttie magnets are very strong and once your phone is mounted its not going anywhere. The CD slot mount is a great option if you want a compact way to mount your phone lower than your dashboard. My daughter now uses this as her daily mount in the Kia Soul and its one of the best solutions weve found for her to use her iPhone for navigation as the CD location puts it in great place for viewing.

I was sent this item, either for free or at a discount, for testing and review purposes.",1
"I recently got into watches, and love the fact that you can change out the strap.  This feature really makes your watch look like an entirely different watch without having to break the bank!

This Nato strap is very high quality, with thick material, stitching (not just glue) and high quality buckles.  I've ordered a few Nato straps for my watch, and this one is by far the highest quality.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anybody looking to make a statement with their watch.

Note - I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  This did not have any sway on my decision.",1
"I received this from Maxboost for my unbiased opinions.

"I am a big fan of Rosewill products, but until I saw this I had no idea they made products other the PC components. I have been using this Kettle for a few weeks now and am very impressed. To start with, the kettle is very sleek looking and fits well in with my stainless steel and black appliances (bought the black one). Its small enough that it can be left on the counter without taking up too much room, but big enough to suit most hot water needs such as instant coffee, hot cereal or even instant noodles. The power cord also can be wrapped up inside the base for storage.
I have used this almost every day since I got this, mostly for Oatmeal for breakfast or making the kids hot cocoa. This pitcher holds 1.5 liters of water and only takes about 2 minutes to come to a boil. It just needs water to be filled to the line, then placed on the base and push down the switch. The kettle is smart enough that once the water gets to boiling temperature, it shuts itself off which is great if your scatterbrained like I am. It does not have an audible warning when its done, just the faint click of it turning off when the lever pops back up. The outside of the kettle stays cool, even with boiling water inside.

This in my opinion was a great purchase and I would recommend it to everyone.

Pros:
Holds 1.5L of water
Heats water to a boil in about 2 minutes.
Outside of kettle stays cool to the touch.
Inside steel is one piece  No seams to break or leak.
Very easy to setup and use.

Cons;
No alert that water is finished boiling other than faint click when kettle shuts itself off. Would prefer a small beep or something maybe.

"Received the product a while ago and i finally used it.
This is my first time trying a VR headset and it is absolutely amazing!
All i can say is that this is beyond cool. I never knew my phone was capable of doing such things.
I've never used Virtual Reality before, but there is an included booklet with the headset that goes over the basic operation of the headset like how to insert your phone and how to adjust the blurry issues.
If you are a gamer or movie enthusiasts, I have to say this is a lot of fun. I am not a gamer but enjoy watching 3D movies and this VR headset makes the experience extremely awesome! It makes me feel like I'm actually there. I love this thing!
The headset itself cannot be used independently but must be used with your smart phone . Opening the front of the headset, place your device into it, laying on a foam piece that helps protect your device. You will need to download VR apps to your phone to use. My samsung galaxy S6 fits very well inside and I never knew there were so many VR apps that can be utilized for this product.
This thing is much better than I thought it would be and it is very comfortable to wear.
I do recommmend it!",0

"I purchased the Ambielly USB Mini Desk Cooler Fan from Amazon seller BUYBOE.  The got the fan in black but it is offered in many fun vibrant colors.  The diameter of the fan is 6 inches and it sits up on a small base that is connected to the fan.  The fan runs off a usb cord that can be connected to your computer or connected to a USB plug into a wall socket.  I got this fan to plug into my computer at work so that I could use it on my desk in the summer time.  It gets so hot in my office building and I have no control over the thermostat.  I also do not have a wall plug close to my desk so my existing fan is on a credenza on the other side of the office so having this one directly in front of me will be great when the 90 to 100 degrees come in the middle of summer and I am stuck wearing business suits.  This fan would be perfect for tellers because they can put it on their desk and help to keep them cool while they are working.  I wish that I would have had one when I was still a bank teller.  The only thing that I don't really like about this product is that there are no speed controls on it. It is a nice calm fan that is comfortable but I would have loved to have a high/low setting on it.

"I received a free item to review.

I have a metal keyboard stand I use for a fairly heavy electronic piano I keep in my study. Wood floors, not in the best shape after all these years, but I'm not looking to gouge them up any more than I have already.

The stand doesn't get a lot of lifting, per se, just gentle sliding around to make room here and there. I'm not looking for silicone slippery either; when I'm playing I want the stand to stay put. These went on easy and they do the job: protect the floor and make it just easy enough to slide the stand quietly without leaving a mark on the floor.",1
"I recently went through physical therapy for a few different problems, including knee problems. I found out I have hypermobility and my patella slides around more than it should.

"I tried these in my normal size since they had pretty decent reviews. I was really excited to get them but honestly, it was one of the more disappointing orders I've gotten with Amazon. I really wanted to love these pants and need a good quality pair of workout pants, but these weren't it. I was originally impressed by the price but not worth it. First, they had a very odd smell when I took them out of the plastic. Fine enough because I knew I could wash them and eventually get rid of the smell. I tried them on and could barely get the calf portion over my legs. I'm not a thin girl, and I know that which is why I ordered a large which is what I usually buy in these style pants. These didn't fit at all. I got them on barely but they were uncomfortable and not something I could wear. The pros were that even with how small they were, they weren't see through at all. They were pretty long for anyone taller. I'm 5'1 so they were a bit too long on me and bunched at the ankles. I would recommend if you have small legs, hips, butt, and waist. They are also a much heavier and thicker material so may be too hot to work out in.",0

I worked in a factory when I was younger and know what to look or when it comes to stitching. The hems on all parts of the clothing is done nicely, they lay flat and are evenly done. The collar of the top has a soft ribbed stretch fabric that accents the colors used in the top and matches the pants. The sleeves have a nice ruffle design to them. The pockets on the front have a stretch opening and are accented with a bow. The colors are vibrant and the floral design is really cute. The pants have a elastic waist band which stretchers and is nicely sewn so nothing bulky is there to make them uncomfortable. On the bottom sides of the pants there are bows that match the bows on the top pockets. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

"I love this case! It's very stylish and functional. It's the best of both worlds. The gold is not as a bright as it is in the picture and looks more like a matte finish, which is fine with me. It doesn't look cheap or too flashy. The case is surprisingly thin and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone. I typically carry smaller bags so this is a huge bonus for me. I also like the different textures on the case. I've been using it for about 3 days and I have yet to drop my phone (it happens more than I care to admit). My favorite feature of the case is that it wraps around to the front of the phone. Most slim cases only wrap around to the sides. With this case my phone is full protected. It also allows easy access the silence toggle, aux jack, and charging port. the volume and screen lock buttons are covered by the case but there is no limitation in usage. The case is also easy to get on and off. When I received the case there was a part of the plastic gold that was sticking up. It was very easy to pop back into place. Otherwise the case is great! I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish and slim case.

I pay the extra bucks to buy the screen and have them installed at Best Buy.  It's too hot outside and I am just too lazy to head out there and wait while they install my screen. They also seem to be judging me for my lack of screen installation skills.  I figured I would get a screen protector off of Amazon and try my hand at it.  I was intimidated since this did not have specific instructions.  What are Guide Stickers?  Dust Absorber?  When did a sticker start getting labeled as such and is it okay with that?  Then the first wipe was not moist and I was ready to call it quits.  I was already stressing out about placing some sticker on my phone all by myself, this is a sign that it was not meant to be...but then I figured that the guide stickers are, oh I don't know, guide stickers?  Placed one on each side and removed the sticker.  Figured out where i want it to go and then let go.  The sticker clung to the phone instantly and no air bubbles (my biggest fear) except one big one on the corner where the guide sticker is.  I used my finger to smooth it out, and was done.  Took a whole 3 seconds to do, but about an hour to work up the courage.  I did receive this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

"I received this bag for free in exchange for my honest review.

I have been using this bag for a couple of weeks now and I am very pleased with it. The bag is well padded. Not just the outer layer, but the bottom and the inner divider. This bodes well for me as I tend to be a bit clumsy and I drop things. I recently got a new laptop at work, so I want to be especially careful. My personal laptop has a cracked screen  because (you guessed it) I dropped it a few months ago.  I haven't dropped this bag with my laptop in it but it has gotten banged around a little. No damage to anything on the inside.
This has plenty of room for other items, there are several pockets; 2 good sized ones in the front, 2 smaller ones on the ends and a small zippered one inside. There is a strap over one partition  to keep your laptop from falling out should the bag fall over. The fabric and the stitching are all excellent quality. The shoulder strap is a little stiff but not uncomfortable. Hopefully, it will loosen up in time.
The price seems very reasonable. I don't think anyone will be disappointed unless they have a laptop larger than the stated dimensions. There isn't much wiggle room.",1
"This is a really nice, thick set. It is a good size. A lot of lunch boxes don't fit a full lunch, drink and ice pack in them, but this does with room to spare.

The koozies are thin, but still keep drinks cold. This is actually nice because they are easy to slip in your pocket if you're doing something like tailgating and then you always have it nearby. The bottle holder works nicely for water bottles that aren't well-insulated. My daughter likes to take her water to school in it because it keeps it cold longer.

I would highly recommend this two pack of tempered glass screen protectors.

"This is my first action camera and I am very surprised how well is made and easy to use. It took few weeks to arrive as it was shipped from China but it was worth the wait. It came very well packaged and all the little accessories were in its place after this long and far journey. Packaging was just OK as all it had was a plastic container and all of the little accessories and the camera in plastic bags. I actually expected to at least have some kind of hard case container for all of this but for this price I guess its OK? You'll definitely need a container like a hard case to keep this camera in and all of its accessories. Despite that, the camera is great. In very small size but it packs some nice specs. It can records in 4K, 2K, 1080P at 60fps, 30 fps and all other 720P resolutions including very cool slow-motion in 720P at 120 fps. This camera also takes up to 64 GB micro SD Card which is great as a 15 minutes movie in 4K took out around 2GB of space. The quality is great especially in the 1080P resolutions. The 4K was just OK but maybe only due the fact that I don't have 4K screen to play it on. For some reason the 2K looked better then the 4K not sure why? No big deal again I would be using the 1080P at 60fps anyway to me it was enough quality and and extremely smooth playback. The remote control its a great addition to it although I did not have a chance to use is yet. I did download the app from Google Play called 'XDV' to connect to the camera's WiFi and it worked great. You can either download the recordings to your phone (unfortunately only to the internal memory of the phone) or delete it from the camera. The easiest way to transfer the recordings out of the camera was through the micro USB cable to your pc. You can also see on your phone's screen what is the camera recording, very useful feature when you have the camera on your helmet that otherwise you couldn't see how is the camera pointing and what is recording. The water proof case sims pretty durable and easy to install. This camera came also with a spare water proof case door just in case the main one cracks or so, nice addition. The spare battery, external charger, lense cleaning ball and the care dash holder are my favorite accessories so far. The cleaning ball you'll be using a lot as every time you  take the camera out of the waterproof case you'll touch the front lense part. I was also able to use the dash holder and it kept the camera sturdy on the dash with no major shakes. Next month I will be able to use this camera in the water and then will update farther. So far I am in love with this toy. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.",1
"This was a fantastic purchase. My husband saw it and fell in love. Upon receiving it I was very impressed with the packaging. It came it a nice jewelry box, inside a cardboard protector and wrapped in bubble wrap. It is stunning. The outside is a beautiful brushed metal. The inside is a sleek, rounded black material. My husband tried it on and said that although I ordered a size smaller then his original ring, it fit perfectly. He can barely tell it is on his hand. He actually liked the ring being tighter but not feeling like it was cutting into his finger. The inside of the ring is the best part because with it being rounded, it is much more comfortable then a flat inside. My husband's hand seems to react very badly (skin peeling) to certain materials but this material has caused no issues whatsoever. I did receive this item at a discounted rate for doing this review but this is a very honest review. We've had the ring just about a week now and I am 100% happy with the product!",1
"Wraps comfortably around my arm (I have small arms), has the perfect-sized key hold but my only complaint is that it does not absorb sweat as well as it advertises. Otherwise, great product!",0
"This bikini is made of high quality, the material is thicker and more well made than the cheaper ones. I went by the size chart and ordered a medium which fits me perfect. I have a waist of about 27 inches and my hips measure approximately 38-39 inches, so this bikini runs true to size. The bikini is very comfortable. The top is padded and ties around the neck and back. The bottomed tie or each side, but I didn't know that the time that I ordered that the bottoms are ruched in the middle, so they show more in the back than a regular bikini. The bikini is still comfortable to use in the water and it dries pretty quickly. I have washed mine and it didn't shrink. It looks very sexy while wearing and adorable at the same time. My husband also really likes this bikini on me. I am happy with it and I would recommend this bikini to other people.

"Love the nice solid weight,feels good in my hand when draw stuff on iPad, unlike other light and cheaper stylus (bought and threw away or lost many of those).
I wish they made clip to carry it around in pocket.  I've made my own from a Uniball pen cap, glued on with Bondic. It's perfect 10 now.  With added clip, it won't roll away, stay upright in my shirt pocket, or stay on the iPad screen with built-in magnet (position your clip correctly and keep the glue low-profile).",0
"These are compared to Van's style. They really look almost like Van's as well. The material doesn't feel cheap but they're not made perfectly. Van's I feel have better quality but when you have a toddler and you're on a budget it's really important to get things that are affordable and toddlers run through shoes really fast so there's no point in buying them expensive shoes that will just end up in a box of used shoes. They grow so fast so these are great to pinch your pennies and they'll last the short time they're in that size. I bought these for my friends son and he grows out of shoes so fast. I went up a size bigger so he'd ""grow into them."" They don't come in a box but a plastic baggie. The rubber around the shoe isn't clean cut like Van's. It's a little sloppy. I did take a picture to show an example of that below. I like that you can change the laces to whatever color you like best. I like that these are unisex. Can be worn by girls and boys. I don't recommend getting these for an older kid because they'd get thrashed being ""cheaper"" made. If your kid values their stuff and takes care of them, they should last a long time.

Overall the price is great the quality is O.K. and great for toddlers. The fit is nice though. They're true to size. The backs are a little scrunched up but will mend to the foot shape eventually.

I ordered this item via Amazon and received the item on time without any problems. The item arrived undamaged without any dents or defects to the item. It is travel season and everyone is headed somewhere outside North America. This item is a must for anyone traveling outside America to power up their devices especially their smartphones and tablets. This solves the problem as it can accommodate the most common electrical plugs in the world. It feels and looks sturdy. I am loving the yellow color and it distinguishes it from the other similar plugs. It also comes with 2 USB ports to charge your devices. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a travel plug for worldwide use. Please see the photo for more information.

"I bought this charger as a replacement for the one that came with the original product.  The original charger lasted a long time (about 4 years) but had begun fraying.  This one works just as well as the original one did when it was brand new.  It has a good length and seems well constructed so I assume it will last for many years.

"I've been longing to get a USB 3 hub as I keep my PC under my desk and I'm constantly reaching way down there to plug in flash drives and what not. This hub pretty much does the job, but the cable is a little short, only about a foot and a half long. About 3 feet would have been perfect, but that's okay, I can get an extension for it. The hub is nicely packaged, and provides great speeds when plugged into my laptop or PC. I don't think I've hit 5gbps, but I don't think any device I've used on there is capable of those speeds anyhow.
The hub does look pretty slick, and definitely looks like a harmonica (not that it matters). I was able to power 2 usb 3 thumb drives, 1 usb2, and a usb 3 Seagate GoFlex dive off of it, and they all worked fine with no drop in speed. Very nice hub indeed! I would totally recommend this if you need a few extra usb 3 ports for your laptop or desktop. Keep in mind, the cable length is not very long, so you may want to pick up a usb3 extender.

This hub does work just fine with windows 10!

"I use this XL-127 in my Epson WF-3540. The ink cartridges that came with it obviously didn't last long. This will allow 900+ pages from what I've read.

I would definitely recommend this ink.",0
"This product is gorgeous. It looks good and the pattern is high quality (not cheaply printed or anything). The variation of ties offered is awesome. However, I don't understand why the typos in the description are necessary. I feel like something like that should be able to be easily fixed. It's easy to tie and as I said, it looks good. There's definitely good value for the price. The fact that it is prime is very nice. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review and I would definitely recommend this product to a friend looking for a fun, stylish tie.",1
Good material build and a lot of storage options. Fit is actually about right. I normally wear a small vest in USA sizes.  The US 'S' Asial 'L' size fit perfectly.,0
"I really like these, they are light weight and easy to pack. My husband has to travel for work and these are nice to pack for him. The bright colors make them easy to locate in luggage and hard to forget in a hotel outlet. We've all ran into that problem; you plug your phone charger into an outlet in your hotel room and then it kind of blends into the wall color and you walk out forgetting it plugged in. With these chargers you are way less likely to leave them behind. The wonderful bright color is sure to stand out against any wall.

"I am new to the world of coffee beans and grinders and when I ordered this, I was looking for a product that fit my budget and that wasn't going to kick me in the buyer's remorse too terribly if I didn't like it. The bag-clamp spoon was a nice extra.

I honestly was not expecting much. There are seemingly hundreds of identical products listed on Amazon and it is hard to tell if any of them are going to be better than any of the others. I can not speak to that, but I can tell you about my experience with this one.

This product did not come with any instructions for adjusting the coarseness of the grind, but it is fairly simple. You turn the adjustment knob under the burr left (loosen it) for a more coarse grind and right (tighten it) for a finer grind. I chose a more coarse grind to use the grounds with my French press. I guessed at how much space I needed to leave between the ceramic burr and the rim of the container and was fairly pleased with how it came out.
It did come with some instructions for use on the side of the box, but it's not really something you need instructions for, in my opinion. It is pretty straight-forward.

The handle comes on and off. There is no avoiding this. It has to come off to open the lid to put the beans in to grind. The handle does not screw on, and there is no way to tighten it. It simply sits over a pentagonal nub that sticks out through the center of the lid.

I found I had to hold the center of the unit while grinding instead of the base, because the center does not catch on the ground container. If you do not hold the center and try to hold the ground container/base instead, the center will spin with the handle and you will not be grinding anything. That said, the ground container is not loose. It will not just fall out. I did have to give it a tug to remove it, so there is very little danger of you spilling your grounds while grinding, in my opinion.

Disassembling for cleaning appears to be simple and straight-forward, but beware of the spring and tiny metal ring that may come out after the burr. Mine tried to bounce right off my counter top, and had I not noticed, I might be missing that ring.

Overall, I like it. I will try to update this after using it for a few months to comment on durability, but it seems to be a decent product for the price. I don't intend on buying another grinder, if that gives you any idea.

Note: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

UPDATE: I have since had to contact the seller for a replacement, as the product broke on the third day of use. As I was only preparing a couple of tablespoons of grounds at a time, that should not have happened. I would have ground enough for 4-5 cups of coffee, total. Hardly heavy use.
The seller was very helpful, asked me to show them what was wrong with the product, and promptly shipped out a replacement. The new unit is working fine, if not better than the first did when it was fresh out of the box.",1

"I-Venstar Portable Bluetooth Speaker, Taco

His is a very nice portable speaker kit. In the box you get the Taco speaker, in an attractive shape and color scheme of red and black. It is contained in a matching zippered protective case for travel and that case has a Carabiner hook on one end. There are also a USB cable and an audio cable. Both fit in the case with the speaker and a manual.

The first thing you need to do after taking it all out of the box is charge it up. Then you will need to pair this to your device. It will connect via either Bluetooth or NFC. I used Bluetooth with my iPhone. I had no issues connecting it. Alternatively, you can use the included audio cable to connect a player device that isn't either wireless technology but has a headphone jack. Oddly the input Jack is under a rubber flap on the bottom of the speaker, next to the charging port. This acts as the stand for the speaker for best placement. When using the wire the speaker won't be able to stand in the best position, poor design choice in my opinion.

When the speaker is standing properly the sound emanating from it is quite good. There is a wide rich sound that envelops you in the music you are playing. It has good bass and sweet highs. My only problem was I wish it played a little louder. I couldn't get that loud sound I was craving. It may be that given to size the designers kept a cap on the sound to keep it from distorting. At the highest level I could play it was a very good sound, it rocks. It also has a speakerphone feature that lets you answer a call on your phone and that was good enough for function.

I like this speaker kit and appreciate the extra stuff you get with it. It's an overall very good speaker with great portability.

"I recently bought a 11 inch laptop and I wanted a small case to be able to put it in while I am on the go.  I thought this would be perfect and I was right.

First off, this is really cute and feels like nice quality.  I was not sure if I would like the elephants, but I was surprised how much I really liked them.  This is also a nice size and will fit my 11 inch with ease.  I was hoping it would not be too big since it was noted to be a 13 inch size, but I think it will work well for what I wanted it for.  I also like that this has a front pocket for my charger and my mouse.  I do not like keeping them in the same pocket as I do not want the computer to get scratched.

Again, I think is perfect for just throwing my computer in to go.

I was sent this item for free in exchange for an honest review.",1

"I purchased the orange Lumsing 40W 5-Port Desktop USB Charger.  I has five USB ports which allows you to charge up to five devices at one time.  A great feature of this charger is that it is able to detect a devices charging mode and switch to accommodate it whether it is a quick charge or a slower charge like my iPhone.  Yes, I have a very old iPhone because I know how it works and also have given my son my upgrades for the past four years.  Anyway, you can charge both fast and slow charging devices at the same time with no problems.

The charger is very well made.  It is made from a heavy-duty rubberized material and feels very solid like most other Lumsing electronics.  It is not very large and sits well on my nightstand.  I have no fear of it moving or falling off my table when I am charging all three devices.  I do need to get shorter charging cords so I don't have a bunch of excess cords cluttering my nightstand.  It comes with a nice heavy duty wall outlet charging cord that plugs into a wall outlet.  It does not come with any USB charging cords, which I did not expect it to.  The device did not make any noise when I plugged it in or during charging.

As soon as I received the Lumsing 40W 5-Port Desktop USB Charger, I plugged in three devices that were almost dead.  One was an iPad Air, another an iPhone, and the last was an iPad Air keyboard that was totally dead.  I was shocked that my ancient iPhone actually charged quicker than it ever has that I can remember and it is not a quick charge.  Not sure why it charged so fast, but I am not complaining.  With the three devices attached, everything charged well and pretty quickly.  I love that I can get rid of three chargers for my devices and now only have one power cord plugged in the wall.

What I like:
 Very sturdy, quality material
 Charges five USB devices at one time
 Quick charging
 Small compact size

What I don't like:
 Can't tell if the charger is on unless I plug a device in to charge; would be nice to have a power light on the charger to show it is on/working

Overall, I am very impressed and will keep using this as my main charger.

Received my Five Nights at Freddy's pillow case yesterday. What a really nice case. The colors are just as or more vibrant than advertised. This is a really good quality pillow case. The case has a zipper closure so the pillow doesn't end up showing or hanging out. The pillow case is definitely large enough to hold the standard pillow and then some without looking over sized. I received this pillow at a discounted price for my unbiased opinion. I do recommend this pillow. My son loves it and gave it the sleep test last night. The material is comfortable and cooling. I will be looking for more of these pillow cases. I am a satisfied customer. These are going to make great gifts for all the gamers in my life. The case did not come with washing instructions but I would wash it by hand or on super delicate in cold water just to be sure the colors don't run or fade.,1

"I recently purchased the HomySnug Automatic Sensor Soap Dispenser with Infrared Detection to use in the kitchen.  What a great purchase!!  You know how hard it is to turn on the water, pump out soap or squirt dishwashing liquid  on hands that are greasy, have handled raw meat.?  No. More. Problem!  Just put your hand under the dispenser  and the infrared light automatically detects your presence, dispensing soap immediately.  No more having to clean up my soap bottle after washing my hands.  There are 3 settings for the amount of soap dispensed  usually the middle amount is quite enough for me.  Easy to set by pushing the button on the top: once for small amount, twice for medium, three times for a lot.  Cant beat that!!
Not only is it convenient, but I feel that there is surely less possibility of contamination from handling raw meat.  Convenience and health/safety with one squirt!  Planning on getting more for the bathrooms as well.

"This 2 in 1 Salt and Pepper Mill Grinder is by Kitchsmart.

The ceramic blade is used for smooth grinding and is won't rust, unlike stainless steel blade.

The acrylic core is Food Grade and BPA free.

The top and bottom coverings are stainless steel.

This is easy to use.  To grind, hold the base of the grinder and twist the metal grinder in a clockwise direction.  To adjust the grinding size, remove the lid from the grinder. Locate the knob inside with dots indicating ""smaller"" to ""larger"". Adjust the grind according to your preference.  To refill, holding the clear base, turn the bottom metal piece counter clockwise. Fill and screw the grinder back in place firmly. Follow the same steps for the other side of the grinder.

I like that I get 2 options to use on 1 grinder but I wish it was a little smaller because if I don't place it back carefully after use, it tips over.  The cap on each end is wonderful as our older pepper grinder did not have a cap so it has to be placed with a small dish under it to catch residual grinds.

"I received a review sample of this product.

I put this into commission for the first time on my Mount Shasta hike. When I took it out of my backpack, I was shocked to see that it had broken into 2 pieces. Yes, you heard right. This flashlight is NOT made entirely of metal. The green band is made from plastic.

What happened was the green band had broken and caused the upper bulb housing to separate from the lower battery housing. It was totally useless. Good thing I had a backup flashlight.

"What Love about this case it's that I can carry my phone, ID, credit cards, and money all in one place, I love it, I don't have carry my wallet or purse if I don't want to.
The case is smooth and the closure tab has a magnet that keeps it close and when you have your case open it sticks to the back, so it won't be on your way.
One feature that I really like is that the front cover has a slit on the top which allows you to keep your phone case close while you're making a phone call, that will keep your cards from being seen from the side. You can turn it sideways and it makes for a nice phone stand.!
I love it.!!! I received this item at discount for my honest opinion and I'm more than happy to use this case!!

"This is a fair scope for the price you pay. It is surprisingly clear with both high and low power. The focal releif is between 1.5 and 2 inches. There is also a focus adjustment for everyones individual eye sight that works well. I did notice that at a higher magnification I had to fine tune the focus just a little bit. The scope has both the red and green color with 5 brightness/ intensity levels for both. The scope uses a standard 2032 battery which is supplied with the scope when it arrives. It also comes with see through scope rings which allows the scope to co-witness with my AR15 standard front sight. The adjustment turrets come with removeable covers and are 1 click=1/4""at 100 yds. It has a positive detent and audible click with every turn. It comes with lens covers, the eye cover is yellow tinted and the far end is clear. Its advertised as fog free lenses. I have not at this point had any problems.
The scope rings again are elevated and see through. They utalize an allen wrench that is supplied with the scope and has 1 screw per side per ring. A flat blade screwdriver is needed to secure the scope to the rifle/weapon. That is the only other tool you need.
Overall, based on cost of scope verses other scopes I have seen at same price, I would give it 4 stars. I did receive this scope at a discounted price in return for an honest an true review.",1

"So far, so good.

This item arrived on time as expected and no damage occurred to the product.  The instructions were clear and concise and I think that the manufacturer was smart in trying to ensure that consumers like me get good suction with this.  I use mine for 3 toothbrushes...1 regular and 2 electric spinning deals and it holds them well.  I stick this to my mirror and it seems to be holding like a charm.  We will see what happens in time, but this seems to have some good design ideas.  For example, the suction itself unscrews from the rest of the holder so you can press it to the mirror / surface better to get a good suction.  I also like the detachability of the unit because that makes cleaning a breeze.  The real selling point, however, is the cover.  Please take a second to read about bathroom surfaces.  Every time you flush, your particles fly through the air and when you have an exposed toothbrush, guess where some of those particles go?  Yep.  It's so gross and since I read that a couple years ago, I've not been without a cover for my toothbrush.  I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  Please know that I just happened to get a discount / free product on this, but I already had it in my cart to buy!

"This product will house only one type of dressing... ranch.  I've actually been looking for a good ranch dressing bottle for some time now, this is my third and final one.  The other two were either too messy or just didn't work well, but this one is amazing!  Here are my thoughts:

Quality - The quality on this ranch bottle is great, from the glass jar to the lid, everything looks perfect.  All the pieces fit together tightly and have a nice finish on them.  This is a well designed dressing bottle that look like it will last for a long time.

Ease of Use - I added my ranch making ingredients to the bottle and gave it a shake.  It mixed everything perfectly, the agitator attached to the top does a great job of making sure the job's done right.  Once I let my ranch sit for an hour in the fridge, I pop the top off the bottle and it poured right out, no problems at all.  The silicone pour spout is a wonderful added feature to this bottle, it makes for very little mess when pouring my dressing.  I wouldn't change anything about this bottle, it's perfect!

Overall, if you are looking for a great ranch dressing bottle, you've found it.  I'm so happy with it, and since we always have ranch on hand in the fridge, it's going to see a lot of use at my house.  I'd recommend this product to anyone, you can't go wrong with it.

"Let me start by saying Per Amazon's Terms of Service: I received this item for free or discounted for my honest review of this product. I am under no obligation to leave a positive review in exchange for a good review, as I am also a consumer and someone that appreciates unbiased reviews. If this item was not up to par I would disclose that in the review and alert future purchasers to the fact that it is not an item that should not be bothered with.

I absolutely love this tripod. I have had similar issues that other people noticed with one of the legs sometimes coming off, but I've noticed it only happens when I'm trying to twist or turn the leg in a way thats close to the limit of its range of motion, and its super easy just to pop right back in. The rubber on the legs does a great job of preventing it from sliding on a slippery table or clinging to a poll if you've wrapped it around a poll.

The only potential complaint I have about it is when I try to use it with my iPad, it's not quite as sturdy and a becomes little top heavy, but keep in mind it's not really designed for use with a tablet. It still works with it though, just takes a little more careful leg arranging.",1

"I have been through countless number of gardening sheers and these are by far the best.  They are small and precise and help me to get all the small detail work in my garden.

I would highly highly recommend this tool!

"This is a compact and sturdy built pump. It comes with accessories to fix flats so you don't have to buy additional items when going on long bike ride or camping. If you get a flat, this kit provides your the essentials to get you back on track. For the price, I see other pumps with similar features so it appears to be a fairly prices item. Attaching and using the pump on bikes is fairly straightforward.

My reason of taking a star of are due to the following
1. The gauge is in kg/cm2 which doesn't make a lot of sense in the US market. I talked to the seller and they were considering either changing the tables for a US market or removing it altogether.
2. I think this kit could use a flex extension to attach in hard to reach places to allow for easier access to valves. I didn't take a star off specifically as other kits in market don't always have an extension, but I believe with the addition this could be a solid kit for the price
3. the needle attachment has threads to screw it in place, however you can't really screw it, it uses the level to secure the need in place. I found that to be a bit bothersome as you have to pull the need out and if you have sweaty hands or slippery fingers, it's not as easy. However I find the need to be solid and if you have another pump lying around, it seems the threading is made to be used in any pump.

These cable clips help me to get my desk more organized and everything more manageable. I also have one of these clips in my kitchen where I have a whiteboard.

"I just love how pretty my candle holders are and couldn't be happier with them. My husband and i don't get time to go out and have fancy romantic dinners so I make those at home when the kids go to bed. Now that I have these beautiful candle holders it makes our dinner a little more fancy. I don't use real candles only because I'm the forgetful type and don't want to burn my house down. I use LED light candles and I can pick the colors I want white, blue, purple, green whatever color I'm in the mood for. The colors are so pretty when they shine off the crystal jewels that surround the bowl. The candle holders are simple but elegant and can bring charm to any wedding, dinner, or party. Each are a different size 11 inches and 13 inches with a wine glass stem like base. They have to be assembled when they arrive but are very easy to put together and you can find out how to put them together on the product page as they don't come with paper directions. Each has 5 pieces that need to be put together all you have to do is screw together the pieces no tools need. When I was assembling them it took me about 10 minutes total with the help of the directions from the product page. If your having a simple wedding ceremony they would be great for the center pieces with flowers surrounding them. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

Not a big generator in wattage but for many applications it works well. I have used mine to power tools around the back of a 3-acre lot where my extension cords just cannot reach. Also great for RV or camping.  Mine smokes a little when first started up but that soon goes away.  It's a little noisy (for camping) but if used properly (at right times and locations) it is fine.  Bigger generators are great if you can afford them or if you are able to lift them.  I would highly recommend this, just be aware of the wattage ratings.",0

"This is a really nice screen protector that went on nice and easy - most of the credit to the ease of installation goes to the proper instructions. In the past the instructions lead me to believe you used the guide stickers as a hinge like application method - after reading these instructions I now realized they are finger holds! So many badly applied screen protectors in the past.

This screen protector does in fact have an oleophobic coating, which I've found advertised on other protectors only to find out it didn't exist. I tested with some fishing reel grease and it did in fact puddle and wipe away very easily with a cloth. Now an oleophobic coating doesn't make your device impervious to fingerprints, but it does reduce fingerprints. In practice, an oleophobic coating makes it possible with a single wipe to remove all the grease and nastys from your screen.

The packaging was also nice, I have more trust in this protector than the ones that arrive in cheap folding cardboard packages. The item arrived in the displayed packaging, not a cheap little cardboard holder like most screen protectors.

There are a few places that i wouldn't recommend putting them only because they will not work correctly. Under Kitchen Cabinets Nope don't seem to work they stay on constantly.

"**This review is for the CaliTime Super Soft Throw Pillow Case Cover Plush Faux Fur 18 X 18 Inches Turquoise**

I love throw pillows and sometimes you want to switch them out, this throw pillow cover is perfect for that. Only 1 cover comes and it is a faux fur pillow cover.  I got mine in the color turquoise and it so pretty and fluffy.

The cover is18""x18"" which is a good size and pretty much a normal size for a throw pillow. It is a solid color all the way around and it has a zipper that zips really nicely and you can tell it is hand sewn but very nicely. The stitching is good quality and I haven't had any issues with the string coming out or unraveling.

These pillow really gives my bedroom a special look and touch. I think this is really good quality and I completely recommend them.

"We purchased the BESTEK 6-Outlet Power Strip Surge Protector for use in our TV room.  Tested all of the AC outlets and they all worked well and grasp the AC plugs snugly.  The selection of USB ports meets all of the charging requirements for our mobile devices.

PROS
  Has one (1) Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 Technology USB port (5/9/12V).
  Has three (3) auto-detect USB ports that can deliver up to 2.4A per port.
  Attractive design with 15.03 x 2.13 x 1.37 inch size that fits easily in tight spaces.
  Keyhole slots on back allow the strip to be wall mounted.
  Heavy duty 6.6 foot (2.0m) 14AWG/300V power cord provides flexibility in power strip placement.
  Has dust covers on the USB ports.  This helps keep dirt, dust and other unwanted things from dropping into the USB ports when they are not in use.  Covers are not childproof.
  The six (6) AC outlets are spaced just far enough apart that smaller charger power blocks can be plugged in side by side with no problem as seen in picture 4.

CONS
  Power switch is lighted.  This can make the strip intrusive in locations where you do not want a bright AC power light (like a dark TV room).
  Description states ""BESTEK surge protector provides premium power protection for your electronics"" but could not find any surge protection rating information either on the unit or in the documentation.  Surge protection is normally quoted in joules.  There is no surge protection rating information on the [...]

Picture 1 -- Power strip arrived well packed with no damage.
Picture 2 -- Nice size and power cord has hook-and-loop retaining strip.
Picture 3 -- USB charging ports under test.
Picture 4 -- Normal AC plugs and smaller charger power blocks fit nicely side by side in all 6 outlets.

Recommend this power strip for anyone looking for a unit that mounts easily on the wall or for locations where the you need a slim strip width.  There are some lingering questions about the surge protection claims so it gets a four start rating.  If Bestek would clarify the surge protection it could be a 5 start device.

I purchased this thinking that I could use it to make spiral potato's, it didn't work so good the first time but after I cut the potato down the middle it seemed to work a whole lot better.. It was hard to hold the potato and the vegetable spiralizer and put pressure enough down to get the potato to go through the blades. Pasta might work easer but I don't make pasta. This comes with its own little brush to wash it with that is wonderful because without it you would never get it clean. also comes with a with a smaller slicer.. (cheese) and a black plastic bag to store everything in. This has two different sides two it which are stainless steal construction, the other parts are made of heavy plastic. the part that you hold to push the item you are trying to slice is like a cap with sharp edges to hold onto your item while you do your slicing. This would be perfect for cheese or softer items. I received this product for free or at a reduced price for my unbiased and fair review.",1
"I have to admit when I saw this money belt I was really looking for a comfortable pack to wear while walking my dogs and not really looking at features other than a place to put my phone, keys and waste baggies. I saw the cute pink camo and decided to give it a try. When it got here I quickly realized that this thing had features I hadn't even thought of and is going to be so very versatile in a wide variety of situations. Not only is it perfect for dog walking, but I can easily see myself using it while travelling, going to amusement parks, etc. For dog walking, did you guys know that the little headphone wire cutouts are perfect poop bag dispensers? I use bluetooth headphones, but I have threaded both headphone wire & poop bags through the slot with ease before, too. That feature was a must have and is right there on the front where I can quickly grab a bag without fumbling through pockets. The front pocket easily holds my iPhone 6 Plus (the big one) and a roll of bags. The second pocket is even bigger, has two mesh sections to keep things organized and easy to find, as well as an attached carabiner to hook your keys too. The back panel is comfortable soft mesh with a pocket there as well. Then, as part of the waist strap, at the front of the pack there is an elastic loop that is perfect for holding pepper spray or anything that you could hook through a loop or attach with a carabiner. Alpha Keeper has seemed to have thought of everything. The waist strap itself is highly adjustable and comfortable. I'm a bigger girl, normally wearing a 2X top and it fits around my waist with a lot of length still available!  I have honestly only slid cards into and out of two of the RFID sleeves a couple of times and they seem well made I've not had any issues with them. If that changes with use I'll update the review and let you know, but for now I'm completely satisfied, a bit impressed even, with both the money belt and the card protectors.

I was provided this money belt free of charge in order to use it, test it out and offer my 100% honest opinion on the product. A positive review is never guaranteed and I write every review exactly the same as if I had paid full price.",1

"These gloves are well made and comfortable.  They are made of high quality material and seem to be durable enough to handle the heaviest of weights.  The strap is convenient and tightens around the wrist so the gloves fit well.  I will say they seem to run a bit small.  I'm an average size guy (5'10"") with average size hands so I chose the Large size.  They do fit very tightly, so I would suggest getting a size one larger than you think you might need.  This was the only reason I gave it 4/5 instead of 5/5.  All in all they are a great product for the price, especially since you get three in one pack.

"With a family of six , I am always looking for containers to put my left over dinners in.  These containers are convenient because they have three different holding spaces.  So if you have a three course meal then you have room for all for the different sides without them touching each other.  The plastic they are made of is a little flimsy.  So when you put them in the microwave for more than two mins they get very hot very fast.  They are really good to carry for in but not to cook in.  The clear plastic lids fit very tightly on the containers and are see thru so you can tell whats in it.

"These pull string pouches have come in handy in more instances then originally predicted.
I actually use one strictly to clean my lenses. And it works AMAZINGLY! I like to keep my important nice stuff nice as long as possible so I exclusively use microfiber clothes along with sprays made specifically for cleaning glasses. I am also meticulous when it comes to spots or specs of any kind on my eye glass lenses. So I clean them multiple times everyday. I only use the inside of the bag by regularly keeping the right sides out (cleaning sides in) to prevent any particles that would typically collect. I use the spray, turn the bag inside out over my hand, wipe them, and simply turn the bag back to keep the sides that touch the lenses from touching anything else.
In addition, I now use 2 of the bags to keep mine and my husbands sun glasses safe and dust free in the glove box of our car. Which prevents the frustration of pulling them out to shield your eyes and then being bothered with them being to dusty and still preventing you from being able properly see. Now they stay clean and at the ready!

"I purchased this fleece lined thermal set in the size medium and color dark brown. The set comes in two piecesa matching top and bottom. I was planning to wear this under my clothes during the winter time when I layer up or as pajamas since I get cold extremely easily. After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase it one size up. Normally, I wear a size small but settled on purchasing the product in the size medium after reading complaints about how small it was. Despite the fact that I sized up, the clothing set was still somewhat small on me! The clothing set was not flattering on me like it was on the model. It looked quite awkward on me. The top was okay, but the bottom felt uncomfortable. The bottom felt so small and tight.

In addition, worse of all, the clothing set does not really feel like what I imagined it to be like. But I guess, it's due to the product being made of 92% polyester and 8% spandex. The product is supposed to be made of fleece, but it doesnt really feel as soft as I thought it would be. It felt kind of coarse. In addition, I thought it was kind of flimsy. Also, I did do a quick inspection of the top and bottom and there were some stray strings. There were fuzzy strings on the end of the sleeves and around other regions as well. I included some pictures of the stray strings but for some weird reason, my camera kept blurring it when I tried to take a closeup. So, I apologize deeply for the horrible quality.

Personally, I would not recommend this product. There are probably better, softer, and more comfortable tops and bottoms out there. I had issues with the sizing and how it fit me. I was not too fond of the quality and found it quite disappointing. If you are considering purchasing this product regardless, keep in mind that it runs small so youll have to purchase it one or two sizes up.

When I wanted my hair short,  I just wear this.  I'm pretty sure that if I cut my hair short it is not going to look perfect like this.  It will be all over the place. Not like this wig.

"This review is for the Mimibox Dual Double Dog Leash Nylon No Tangle Coupler Leash for Two Dogs

We have three rescue dogs of various sizes with two teens walking them nightly. One of the dogs has to be alone and the other two are usually handled together. My son has been using this double leash by Mimibox and says he is enjoying it. It is a woven plastic type polyester fiber which gives some stretch when pulled and the handle is covered in a dense foam. I am not sure how the foam handle will hold up but as of now, they are enjoying the leash and say it is very handy. They are having no trouble with the different sizes of the dogs either. My son who is using this is pushing six feet and has very large hands, he says it fits him fine. I have attached a photo they took on one of their walks.

Current price - Prime: $14.99  which seems low compared to many of the double leashes I have looked at before. It is a very decent leash for the price.

"Plugable sent me a free sample of this adapter in return for an unbiased review, so here is my review of the product.

My system is as follows.

Dell Alienware 17R3 laptop
- Intel Core i7-6820HK (up to 4.1GHz)
- 32GB Dual Channel DDR4 2133Mhz
- Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M with 8GB GDDR5 memory
- 17.3 inch UHD (3840 x 2160) display
- 1TB PCIe SSD + 1TB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/s HDD
- OS: Windows 10 Home
External monitors
- Dell UP3216Q (32 inch 4k monitor)
- Dell P2715Q (27 inch 4k monitor)

Display adapter
- Plugable Thunderbolt 3 Dual DisplayPort Output Display Adapter (this adapter)

Both Dell UP3216Q and Dell P2715Q are capable of displaying 4k@60Hz. P2715Q can also be daisy-chained.

Firstly, I'll write about results, and then write about software update.

UP3216Q can work at 4k@60Hz no matter how it is connected to this adapter. It can be connected alone to this adapter, connected in parallel with P2715Q, or daisy-chained behind P2715Q. In all cases, it works at 4k@60Hz.

P2715Q can work at 4k@60Hz when it is connected alone to this adapter or connected in parallel with UP3216Q, if MST (daisy-chain support) is turned off (the default is off). Note that it can work at only 4k@30Hz if MST is turned on, even if it is the only monitor connected to this adapter.
When MST is turned on and it is used as primary display, it can do only 4k@30Hz. The bottom line is that you have to turn off MST if you want to use this monitor at 4k@60Hz. I don't know if it's supposed to be like this or it is supposed to work at 4k@60Hz even if MST is on. But I don't plan to daisy-chain monitors for now, so I don't care. I just wanted to try and see how it did.

To summarize it, both UP3216Q and P2715Q can work at 4k@60Hz at the same time when they are connected to this adapter individually (with MST turned off). So, I think it's safe to say that this adapter is compatible with Alienware 17R3.

For both monitors, I used Dell's Displayport (DP-mDP) cables that came with the monitors. I also tried gold-plated Displayport (DP-mDP) cables I bought from Amazon, but cables seemed to make no difference. The adapter worked stably with any cables.

To make this adapter work, it is important to have updated software, namely, system BIOS, Thunderbolt 3 Controller Driver, Thunderbolt 3 NVM firmware, and graphics card drivers. I updated BIOS from 1.2.3 to 1.2.15 and updated Thunderbolt 3 Controller Driver from 15.2.32.6 to 16.1.47.2 before doing these experiments. Both can be downloaded from Dell support site.

In terms of graphics card drivers, my Intel HD Graphics 530 driver version was 20.19.15.4390 after I installed the latest driver from Dell support site, and that wasn't enough. I was getting BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) with error message SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED whenever screen timed out. So, I updated the driver to version 20.19.15.4463 by going to Device Manger and clicking Update Driver... button on the graphics card. Since I updated the driver, I haven't had any problems. My Nvidia Geforce 980M driver version is 10.189.13.5940 which I download from Dell support site.

In terms of Thunderbolt 3 NVM firmware, Dell support site does not have updates. The current version is 13 according to Thunderbolt 3 Settings utility (please see attached pic). I am aware that Plugable mentions on this page that firmware version 14 or higher is required. But I guess that doesn't apply for Alienware 17 R3. This adapter is working fine with NVM firmware version 13.

Overall, the adapter is working fine, and I'm happy about it.",1

"I do colored pencil art.  Prismacolor is the go-to brand for many colored pencil artists.  Even if they have other sets (and they probably do), they also have Prismacolor.  I have larger sets for my artwork, but I wanted a set of 24 which fit a case I purchased to use with a coloring book when I travel.  Something to have along with me in addition to my reading book and my sudoku book.  These pencils were well-packed and arrived safe and sound.  If you get pencils that have been bouncing around in a box with no packing to stabilize them, be warned that they are probably damaged. Complain. The lead can shatter.  (This can also happen when you drop a pencil onto a hard floor surface.)  That is what has happened when you start sharpening a pencil and you end up with piece after broken piece.",0

"I ordered 12MO (L) in dark gray, the color was exactly as picture but size was too big for my 11 month old! He is average height and a little chunky so I returned it, ordered 9MO (M), crossed my fingers hoping it wouldn't be too small. Everything fit perfect except the pants. It was a little loose and a bit long but easy fix just need a belt and shorten the pants with one fold. My son looks so handsome, perfect suit for a ring bearer!",0
"I got this today and at first it was pretty nice. I liked the plastic and it all snapped together well. Unfortunately the plastic around the home button really makes the fingerprint ID difficult, major turn off for the case. I already stopped using it after a day it gets annoying when the case won't let your phone unlock.

Another thing, the case snaps together on the corners, I don't really care for that as it make split apart if I drop it on a corner.

The only reason this got 3 instead of 2 was because of the screen protector and if you don't use fingerprint ID it would work well.

"I debated for quite a while before buying this.  Yes it has rave reviews but most were from people who were given a sample to try for free for their honest review.  And not as a part of the Amazon Vine program.  Those reviews I still rely on for they are thru Amazon.  I had no idea how to perceive all these positive reviews.  But I decided to give it a shot and am very glad I did.  I needed a thermometer just for home cooking to check my meats and everything else.  After a bout with the stomach flu I realized I definitely needed to make sure I was cooking my meats enough.  Even the frozen pizzas I cook say what the internal temperature should be and I never checked with a thermometer.

This cooking thermometer comes well protected in a plastic tube in which it is stored.  The thermometer itself is well made and seems pretty durable.  And honestly it is very easy to use.  I appreciate the long needle so I will never burn myself by mistake.  And it reads the temperature pretty quickly.  The longest it has taken for me is 10 seconds to keep rising to the final temperature.  And it is no surprise that I have been overcooking my meats and other foods for quite a while now.  This is also very easy to clean.  Simply wipe the end of the needle with a wet cloth and dry.  I can not say how it would be for projects like making candy or more detailed types of cooking but for me with basic cooking needs like meats I feel it is definitely reliable and after using it for a couple of weeks now it still works as flawlessly as it did at the beginning.

How long will it actually last?  As I said it seems very well made but only time will tell.  Honestly though as of now all my impressions are only positive and I will say again this is MY PERSONAL REVIEW and not one of those written after receiving the item for free.  I recommend this cooking thermometer and am very pleased I went ahead and purchased it.",1

"The polywoven bags from itbagfashion are of top quality. I absolutely love my bag! The items were tested for a few weeks so that I could give the best quality review. The bags arrived very fast after they were ordered. The bags hold their shape quite well. The colors are beautiful. There are plenty of pockets to hold everything that you need. The straps are well made and really compliment the bags. The silver accents really makes the bag pop. The weaving on the bags are well made and I don't see the quality wearing down after multiple uses. This is my first time using the seatbelt bag. I remember when they first came out a long time ago. I could not wait to get my hands on one to really see what the buzz was about. Im glad to have been given the opportunity to be able to review a few of their products. I loved their bags so much that now my mom is a huge fan of their bags. She has the laptop bag along with the matching wallet. I have a few of the messenger bags, a backpack bag, 2 wristlets and matching wallets for my messenger bags. We plan on ordering more since they have a really nice color selection. The wristlets are absolutely the best. The messenger bags are just beyond awesome. If you are looking for something of high quality and worth every penny please check out what itbagfashion has to offer. There is a bag to match any mood or outfit. I truly believe that itbagfashion will have you covered. Their polywoven bags are the best on the market. I cant wait to add more to my collection.

"This cable was great, right up until it failed. Got it for my daughter's iPhone and it seemed fairly rugged and high quality. No problems charging for months. Then, it just up and quit. It was never under ANY strain, was always in the same spot and used to charge the phone overnight. She never even took it out of the house. I just cannot recommend this cable.

"I've been using this band for about a week now and it's still one of my go to bands when I'm not using my Fitbit to workout! The band is very sleek and slender, perfect for my small wrists and the Milanese band style has gotten me lots of compliments!

Installation was definitely longer than the installation of the leather band I got from Bayite. That's because the latch that secures the band to the Fitbit isn't preinstalled like the leather band was. Instead, you get a small bag of 4 latches, which is great if you accidentally lose them. Here's a tip for easy installation I found out afterwards. The band has Bayite engraved in it. You want that facing down when securing the band to the Fitbit so no confusions as to which end goes in which end!

I do have small wrists so naturally I bought a small Fitbit blaze. With the silicon band, I wear it to the 4-5th notch. With this large stainless steel band, it barely fits on me before it starts to move around too much for heart rate to be accurate. Additionally, if you move too much, the magnetic metal clasp can also start to slide and loosen up. Although this could be a factor cause I'm wearing the clasp up to the very top since my wrists are too small. I kinda wish they had made this a little bit smaller!

Overall, the band is very stylish and sleek looking. Installation was originally a pain but is a breeze now. And nothing I can do about the size.

"Glad I got a new bikini for the summer! I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I have thus far been wearing my bikini out and about to the pool and to the beach. I usually wear size 8 in clothing and ordered an XL just to be safe. It fits well, although I wish the top were a little smaller. The bottoms were right on point. The design is cute. You have the string halter top and the bottoms which tie at the sides. An additional design element is the light ruching on the back of the bottoms. Very flattering! The fabric of the bikini is nice and has a good amount of stretch. The top is lightly padded which provides sufficient coverage. Great item for the price.",1
"When my previous can opener broke after many years, I purchased several cheap dollar store types which just did not work right. I came across this 'Topbest Professional Heavy Duty Can Opener' on Amazon and decided to give it a shot. It's sleek stainless steel construction makes it very attractive to display in the kitchen. It feels solid and has so far been very durable in the short time I have had it. It slit and sliced through the metal can lids effortlessly with no chewing or stray metal shavings. It was easy to turn and I had no issues with it skipping or getting stuck. As an added bonus, it also features a bottle opener and a soda can tab lifter. Very happy with my purchase and it fits in nicely with my other stainless steel kitchen accessories.

"says it is out of paper when it isn't, and blows through ink like crazy.  Although it has a dedicated large black ink tank, it only uses that tank for really dark areas of photos ... not for black and white standard text prints.  As soon as the small black tank is empty your standard text prints come out blank, unless you do photo high quality print of the text document which takes forever and munches through ink like crazy.  So you have to buy all the other inks, as they don't sell the small black one separately.",0

"Can I just tell you how much I love these Bamboo and microfiber blend towels!!!! These towels are extra large,so if you are like me I do have a dishwasher but I do not use it every day,there are only 3 of us in the house and usually especially in the summer time most things get cooked outside so less clean up,but if I do have things to wash or on holidays when I have too many things to fit into the dishwasher I lay a dish towel down on my counter(because I hate dish drains!) and will wash my dishes or pots and lay them down on the towel to dry. This towel will allow much more space for one thing and will dry so much more before needing to get another towel. These towels are so absorbent,and nice to look at,not to mention the feel of them are awesome! These towels are very well made with a very nice heavy thread finish all the way around the towel. They are smooth on 1 side and ridged on the other. These towels measure a whopping 28 inches long by 20 inches wide!!!!,I believe I am going to be going back for more  as gifts,I like to wrap gifts to friends in nice dish and hand towels and wow will they be happy with these!!!

"This is an excellent case for the LG G5. It has a sturdy build quality and feels like it is manufactured with good materials. It offers a good amount of protection for your phone. Definitely better than having no case at all!

I have tried this case out and I like it. It isn't too bulky or anything, so it still fits in my pocket just fine. All the ports and I/O outlets have good, proper cutouts. All my charging cables still fit in my phone well. I haven't had any problems plugging in a 3.5 mm plug. The cutout on the back for the fingerprint sensor/ power button feels just right. The camera cutout doesn't block the camera at all (even the wide angle lens) and offers good protection to the glass. The IR blaster still works and all the microphone/ speaker cutouts are just right.

I am very satisfied with this case. I really like it and I do recommend it if you like the look of it. Unlike some of the other reviewers for G5 cases, I actually own an LG G5 and this is an authentic review. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, however my opinion of the product is my own and was not in any way influenced by this factor.",1

"Wish I could give them 100 stars. They are that protective.

I cook mostly with cast iron and the handles are always hot, along with the rest of the pot. When I received my gloves, I wanted to put them through the ultimate test. I lifted a pan of sizzling bacon from the fire and put my right hand under the pan to hold it. I DID NOT get burned. Pictures below of during experiment and the gloves afterward, showing no melting of the silicone.
I am so impressed with these gloves. Can't wait until my next canning session. No more wet pot holders causing me to get burned. I will be able to lift hot jars straight from the pot without tongs. I have more intended experiments and will update my review as needed.

I recently got 2nd degree burns on my hand from the hot air blast when opening my BBQ lid. It was a freak type accident. If I had these gloves then, my hand would not have gotten burned.

Normally cooking mitts and gloves are too large for me, but these fit good with only about  1/4"" to 1/2"" extra length in the fingers. My husband is already trying to take them from me.

I received these gloves at a free or reduced price for my review. My review is 100% my own. I did not receive any monetary gain, nor am I associated with this company. I am happy I got to try and review this item.

I depend on reviews a lot in my decision process before making a purchase. I hope my input has helped someone make their decision to purchase these gloves.",1

"Great screen protector! This screen protector is nicely made with perfectly fitting cutouts. The package included a couple ""alignment assist stickers"" to place on the edges to give you a place to hold the glass while aligning and IT WORKS PERFECTLY! I feel like no one would have a problem getting the fitment right on the first try with this system.

Where some other glass screen protectors are open at the top and bottom, leaving a lot more of the plastic screen of the S7 Active vulnerable to scratches, this one goes all the way around the buttons and sensors!

The curved edge is a very nice touch! It looks better and feels better... You can barely feel where the screen protector starts when running your fingers along the edge!

I don't have any issues with the screen lifting at the edges, which tends to be a very common issue with TGSP's on newer phones with slightly, given that this phone has a flat screen, no issues there! This one adheres completely all the way to the edge on both sides!

I would definitely recommend this product to friends and family! This is one of the nicest screen protectors I've used and will likely purchase these protectors for my future phones!

"This fan serves the need for a quiet yet effective fan while working at my desktop computer. The fan is small (mini) and unobtrusive but sends an adequate amount of cool air. The fan comes in a variety of colors. The package includes a USB charging unit that allows both indoor and outdoor use. The fan has a switch for a light or strong wind choice. The base is sturdy and easily adjustable for various angles. The device emits a red light when charging and blue at full charge.
I appreciate that the seller, Sofisundance, contacted me with useful information prior to testing the product. ""Testing"" the product refers to the fact that I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"I'm going to start by saying I was very excited when I purchased this blouse. I received it quickly and it was packaged well.
I rarely ever leave a bad review or have any complaints. With that being said I was so disappointed when I received this top. I ordered XXL thinking it would probably fit perfectly as most XXL do. I chose the  dusty blue in color. I received the top and I was super excited I couldn't wait to put it on. I was in complete disbelief as I put it on. It has zero stretch and is not true to it's size at all. I got my arms in it and over my head and that was it. I was very discouraged.
So I decided to run my own test considering I ordered my size.
My husband is very tall and thin and he wears a large in shirts. So automatically I asked him to please try on the top. He did. It fit him but barely if he had breasts it would have in fact been to small on a man smaller than myself. He asked me what size it was supposed to be and I told him and he was just shocked. Ladies my advice is if you're going to order this blouse get it at least three sizes larger than what you wear.
The blouse in question is beautiful the lace back is so gorgeous and it is very classy. I know it would be beautiful on the right person but it is not at all true to its size.

"I have purchased a pair after seeing the price charged by ""the big boys"" of the sunglass  industry.  The workmanship of the sunglasses from those ""big boys"" does justify a bigger price tag.  However, for over $100 less, you can buy a pair of sunglasses that look almost like the major brand (though they will not feel that way in your hand, but others will be unlikely to tell the difference when they see you wearing them) and have very decent polarized lenses.  Remember, also, the pricey brand is made in Italy.  The Luenx aviators are probably made in China.  Today, many of the items we use everyday, including much of the clothing we wear was made in China.

If you want a respectable pair of sunglasses without draining your bank account, I would recommend this pair.",0

"Outstanding!  Really beautiful craftsmanship on this mug, with excellent attention to detail -- no flaws or imperfections on the mug I received, which I unboxed and thoroughly inspected, before re-packaging, wrapping and giving it as a gift.  I like the large size, generous handle, and all of the artwork was exceptional, creating an overall look and feel of a gift very worthy of giving or receiving.

What made this really special was that it was for a huge golf fan who also happens to own several recovery (""clean and sober"") homes, and so the homage to the ""Serenity Prayer"" was just the icing on the cake.  He actually thought it was custom made, considering the coincidence here, so this is an occasion where it was just a remarkable find, where the creation of this particular mug suited a situation perfectly.

High quality item at a very affordable price and this could easily fetch twice the price, if in a gift shop somewhere.  I was really impressed.  Also appreciated that it was well packaged, and arrived without any damage, and comes boxed, not loose like a mug off the shelf of a store.

* Excellent quality
* Functional novelty mug that will get plenty of use
* Terrific value for the price
* Would definitely recommend to a friend
* Would definitely buy again

Hope this was helpful.  Thanks for reading!",0

"This was going to be my last attempt at finding a whistle to use with my two very STUBBORN yorkies. They used to be very quiet but then they suddenly found their voice. The bark at everything. and I was reaching my limit. I have purchased at least six different whistles. None of them were quiet was supposed to be by they were just high pitched. even the adjustable ones I could not find any that would get their attention. Most of them they ignored, occasionally giving me that look that says I'm annoying. One whistle did cause them to run under the bed and unfortunately it made every body in the room want to run away as well. I marked that one with nail polish so I can possibly use it as a repellent the next time the neighbor dogs come snooping around.

I opened this up and first thing I noticed is that it is different from the others. (see Pictures) This whistle is longer than the other whistles that I have .It is also minutely larger around. Then there is the black cover. I immediately attach it to the lanyard, just to keep it handy for the first time I want it. I knew it wouldn't be long. I double checked my email and I still didn't get my eBook. The dogs soon came into the same room I was in and were playing. Then they started to get rough and began to bark and growl. I immediately blew the whistle. Whewww. The both stopped and looked at me then they sat. I about fell over. They started to play again and when hey started to act a little rough I blew it again. OMG. What power. I have! This is great I love it. this whistle works. I've been using this whistle for several weeks. I am starting to teach them a few things that they seem to be getting. I blow one hard long one when they are misbehaving aor right at that point to. They stop what they are doing and sit. Three short blows mean to come here and so far they do! This is all the further we've gone. but to me. This is awesome.

If you are looking for a whistle I recommend this one. It did / does work with mine. It conveniently comes with a lanyard  and has a nice sleek look. Oh by the way shhh this whistle is almost silent.

"I received this product and although it showed up in reasonably good condition. I feel like this product is not very well made, there are minor scratches on the lens part as well as frayed stitching on the elastic bands. I am kind of disappointed because after reading the description I was hoping these would fit my 18lb schnauzer who has a mo hawk and I was tickled at the idea of getting him some sunglasses. However once they arrived although yes I can set them on him the straps do not tighten small enough to make them stay as well as the fact that the ""glasses"" part takes up more than half of his face, I personally have 5 dogs that range from 18lbs all the way up to 150lbs so I am sure these glasses are fine for my larger dogs. When I tried them on my 90lb golden mix they fit him ok but the bottom strap doesnt really tighten enough around his narrow shepherd like nose. I would not buy these unless you are just looking for a novelty item for photos etc due to the sizing issues. Also this product did not come with any instructions for how to put these on and although I was pretty sure I knew how I did have to double check against you tube videos for similar items. All in all they are ok but in future if I am in need of goggles or sunglasses for my pups I am likely to go with a more size specific option.

"Full disclosure - I received this battery case for free in exchange for a fair and unbiased review.  This review is unbiased as I can make it.  I felt that this battery case was pretty good  I had close to triple the amount of battery than I have with my regular iPhone 6s battery.  I am not one who is constantly on my phone.  If you are constantly on your phone (turning it off and on or always streaming), it might only last double the battery life -- which is still pretty good for a battery case.

The case buttons fit well over the phone buttons.  The outside casing is pretty sturdy and provides good shock protection.  I would prefer that the case provide face protection, but I guess you can't have everything.  That is the main reason I did not give this case a 5-star rating.

I can't say whether the charging system will have some negative effect on my iPhone battery, as indicated in other reviews.  I haven't used the case long enough and only time will tell. Overall, I think it is a pretty good case and a fairly good value of providing additional protection and power of a battery case.",1
"Im disappointed with this dress; it looked so cute in the picture. I wanted something comfy and casual to wear for my college graduation because its outdoors and this looked perfect. I ordered the olive green because I own too much black clothing lol. The color was nice, true to color but it was so big!! It looks like a pajama lol. The material is nice and flowy but the smallest size was way too big, its past my knees. For reference, Im 52 and 100 lbs. I would not recommend this dress for short people like me, unless you are fuller figured which I am not. Im thinking about returning this, but I may end up keeping up as a pj or give it to my mother or a friend. I would really encourage people to check the size chart before ordering, this is where I went wrong. To be fair, Im giving this product 4 stars for quality and speedy delivery.*

"This charger is crazy cool! So it's really basic to understand. You just plug your new charging pad into your laptop with the USB cable it comes with, then a red dot shows up in the octagon in the middle to let you know that it's plugged in and recognized. Then, if you have an iPhone like I do, you plug in the pad labeled 'Wireless Charging Receiver' make sure you push it in really good because at first I didn't think it was working. I just applied a little extra pressure then set it down on the charging pad. This futuristic-looking charging pad turned blue and the lightning bolt next to my battery indicator showed up letting me know it was charging. I had my case on my phone still so I was thrilled I didn't have to go through the trouble of taking it off! So what I think I'm going to do is take off my case, plug the wireless charging receiver in, and then put my case back on so it's not only safe back there, but when I walk into my house I can just put my phone on the charging pad and walk away!! I think that's what it's intended for anyway, but I'm thrilled and I feel like a genius :) It has non- slip feet on the bottom also so when the car is stopped I definitely feel comfortable letting it charge there too.

"I've been doing CrossFit pretty regularly for about a year now. My back squat has gone from 135 lbs to 255 lbs in that time. I've also gotten really into backpacking and hiking, so needless to say my knees have taken a beating recently. I had gotten to the point where I've had to stop mid workout due to knee and other joint issues. These knee sleeves have definitely helped alleviate a lot of those issues. My knees feel much more secure when lifting heavy and allow me to push my body once again without worrying so much about my joints. I'm hoping to squat 300 lbs in the next 6 months!

These are my first pair of knee sleeves so I cannot compare them to the more expensive brands out there, but I cannot imagine they are all that different than these. At half the price, I would definitely recommend giving these a shot first to see if they help you. I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review. In no way do I let that impact my opinion on this product.",1
"I love having something in my closet that is so easy to wear and so flattering at the same time. I am 5'3"" tall with a 36 DD bust and I weigh 140lbs. Like most larger busted woman I really struggle with finding a dress designed to give me a flattering fit that Isn't either too tight or that I fall out of when I bend over. This dress not only makes me feel attractive and beautifully dressed, but fits me as if it was designed just for me. The top has a stretchy fabric that conforms to my body shape without being tight in any way. It actually moves with me, so I have confidence at all times that there is no gapping or too much showing even though it is a v-neckline. The fit over my back and shoulders is so comfortable and I feel like I have complete range of motion as I move. The skirt has a delicate lace overlay that is exquisite. The ruched waist even hides my ""not as flat as it used to be"" stomach area. I can wear this dress just about anywhere- out to dinner, out for drinks or to a business party and never feel over dressed or out of place. It slips on and off over your head, so there are no buttons or zippers to mess with either. This has to be one of the most comfortable dresses I have ever owned.

"I am in love with this cup. I'm a notorious purse, pen and cup snob. I have high expectations and won't settle for mediocre.

I had a more expensive brand I absolutely loved.. That I lost during a recent trip. It was a gift, but being frugal, I couldn't justify the expense of replacing it.. Until I ran across this cup. I was skeptical its quality would be as good, considering the price was half that of its competitor. I was wrong.

I ran several tests.. Both hot and cold. The cup actually surpasses its own claims.  It states it keeps drinks cold over 24 hours. It maintained ice (with lid on and sealed, untouched) for 30 hours and once the ice melted, the liquid maintained a cold status for over 40 hours. I'm sure it would have exceeded that, but I ended the test at the 42 hour mark.

Next was the hot test. I love my coffee hot and I like to sip it slowly through the day. This cup maintained heat for 12 hours. I was thrilled.

I also love the stainless steel straw that comes with the cup. My other cup did not have this. The cup is a brushed stainless steel.. So finger prints, smudges and scratches are not an issue.

There are only two cons.. But they are NOT unique to this cup... All cups this size and design have the same cons.  One.. The cup is large and weighty. I have small hands, so grasping the cup is not easy. Two.. The cup is too big to fit under my Kurig. I have to make the coffee in a different cup and transfer it. Not a big deal...and pretty good to have only two minor cons.

In the end.. I love this cup and it goes everywhere with me. Don't waste your money spending double for its competitor. This cup has a straw, two lids and a straw cleaner... In my opinion... This cup is the best choice.

"I have a small patio so this is great for limited space. I have 3 planters that have a base of 8 inches, diameter and depth of 12inches, that I have placed on it. This is the maximum sized planter you could put on it if you plan to use all 3 stands. The planters do hang off a bit, but I was able to maneuver the legs around and find a spot where they only hang off about an inch. It seems sturdy once the planters are on it but very unsteady by itself. I don't plan on testing it out in our Texas storm season, as I have delicate flowers planted in my pots, so this will be moved in doors for storms.",0

"The printer ink is excellent! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. When I received the product, it came in a small cardboard box. This product came with two sets of 4 ink cartridges and for the normal price, is an excellent deal. Even though I know how to install these particular ink cartridges, it does not come with instructions anywhere, which was unfortunate. I wish it came with instructions because that would help those that may have not have to install printer ink before, especially from third party brands. I had depleted my last set of printer ink, so I removed the old ink from the printer, and proceeded to install the new printer ink cartridges. Once all new printer ink was installed, I closed the printer and then started printing a test page. The ink seems to work great and the test page showed all ink to be printing the colors properly and all alignments are set properly. These XL cartridges have three times the capacity as normal 564 cartridges, so these cartridges should last me a while. These cartridges work much better than the last set of printer cartridges because the last set were also third party, but they also leaked ink when I was removing the orange bottom from the cartridge so it caused a mess on my hands. This set did not cause a mess for me and installation was a breeze because of it. I highly recommend this product if you need HP 564 ink because this has more ink than normal cartridges, fits in the printer perfectly, and the price is excellent when you have two sets of cartridges!",1

"When you have a valuable phone, it is imperative that you protect it.  This is a nice case for doing just that.  I've never seen a hybrid case before that wasn't two pieces, but this one is indeed a hybrid case all in one piece,  It's nice and thin--just nominally larger than the phone itself.  I like how the case has multiple colors, yet a simple design.  All in all, I'm well-pleased with this case.

I got this beret hat for my daughter who has her own style and she absolutely loves it.  The hat is a one size fits all and fits her head great but seems like its geared more for children as its tight on my head.  (Adult)  The hat itself is warm so she loves to wear it on chilly or windy days. This would be a good hat for a costume or play or if your kid is like mine than just to wear around.  An adult might be a little disappointed because its not the highest quality and the wool blend its made from feels just like felt and it does like to attract a lot of lint. The size is also too small for most adult heads.  You might get it on but its going to be tight.  Overall for the price its okay.

I uploaded a small video of it to show it off a little better.  Ive attached pictures of the product I received below.

If you have any question please don't hesitate to ask. Ill be more than happy to help answer any question if I can.

"I love the shoe, bit they are too small",0
"I really like this sun dress. It is made more like a tube top dress but it has the added feature of the halter top string that ties around your neck. I am currently using this as a pool and beach dress, but plan to take it with me on a cruise I am going on in August. It is always great to have little sundresses like this around. It is a one size fits all, and I am about 39-40 inches around the chest area. The measurements say that it will fit up to 47 inches but it fit me a bit snug and much more would had spread out the tube top portion a bit too much, in my opinion. It is super cute, though. The colors are bright and the dress really does look great on. I am only 5 foot 3 inches so this dress does fall to my knees. I purchased this one in the red, pink, and orange colors. I like the choice I made. It is a perfect set of summer colors. So overall happy with my purchase. Dress fit me well and works great as a cover up and just a regular summer dress. I received this dress at a discounted price to give my honest review and this is my honest review of this product.",1

"I love this little magnet!  I mounted it on my dash and can now see my phone without taking my eyes off the road. It works beautifully. I've been using it for months, through a very hot summer and have had no issues with the base staying where I put it or with my phone stating attached.  Super easy to install.  Fantastic purchase!",0
"Fantastic battery bank! Super happy with this purchase. Love that it's water/dust resistant, perfect for the beach to keep devices running. My only criticism would be that the port covers seem a bit flimsy and do not seal well especially on the dual USB side. Other than that very happy with device and love the added benefit of solar charging while out and about. The slot for holding the phone up to watch videos is another plus but FYI it does not fit all phones WITH cases on. Some smaller cases/phones have fit, but a lot of cases need to be removed to use this feature of the charger.  ** I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.",1
"These ear muffs definitely have the most sound reduction of any I have used during lawn mowing or other loud equipment operation.  They do fit very snugly - too tight for my head.

I recently was issued an iPhone 6 at work and was told that I would be responsible for any damage to the device. So I quickly started to look for cases and accessories to keep it safe and undamaged. This is a great budget case that offers minimal protection, but retains the sleek look of the phone. This clear case allows you to see the phone, but still protect it without adding a lot of bulk. This is a well-constructed case that has softer sides and a harder plastic back. They did a great job with transitioning from each material. The cutouts are on-point and the buttons are covered yet still ""clicky."" This case does not cover any of the ports. I had no installed the tempered glass screen protector when I took the pictures, but I can tell you that it does not affect it.

Just word of caution: these clear cases show all your fingerprints. This did not bother me as I clean my phone every day or two, but may discourage others that do not like to see fingerprints.

Verdict: 5-Stars! I love the case. It is sleek, simple and effective at minimal protection. I will install a glass protector so I am not worried that it does not have a higher front lip. My cables also fit the charging port opening.  I hope Amazon shoppers find this review helpful. Thank you for the opportunity to review this case.

How my Ratings Work:
1 Star = Awful. Complete junk. Do not buy. Stay far away.
2 Stars = Not good at all, but there are a few redeeming qualities...
3 Stars = It's okay. It's not terrible, but I'm not thrilled with it either.
4 Stars = Fantastic! I love it, but there are a few things that could improve.
5 Stars = This product is wonderful in every way. Buy it! Re-buy it! Worship it!!!

"I recently purchased this pair of sunglasses, and so far I a very happy with them. I ordered the brown/brown set. The frames are a mid to dark brown. The outer edges of the frames have an etched gold pattern. The frames are comfortable an fit my face well. The lenses are a light brown, and they make everything appear lightly brownish. I like the brown lenses. I have ha sunglasses with other colored lens and it they make everything look weird. The brown makes everything look Moe natural, just tones down  bit. The sunglasses come with a cloth drawstring sleeve that is perfect to store them in. The bag protected them from getting scratches in your purse or bag.

Ordered in my normal size 8 and they were too big.  Received 7 1/2 and they fit better however they do not have a good cushion in them. Felt kind of hard on my tile floors.

"I really like this shirt.

First, the fabric is really soft, It's a jersey knit type of fabric, but it's a thicker fully weave so tehre is weight to the fabric, but not heavy and a softness that you do get in most t shirts.

The color is what I expected from the pictures.

The shirts flows and moves very nicely.

There is a horizontal seam about 4 inches from the top of the blouse.  I wasn't really sure about it at first - if it was going to make the shirt look funny.  the Seam sits above the bust-line which is why it seems odd.  But, once the shirt is on, the seam is fine and doesn't detract like I was afraid it would.

I received the shirt Saturday and got to wear it to church Sunday.  Got a few compliments even.

"I really like this flashlight. It has bright medium and soft modes, as well as strobe and SOS modes. It starts at bright and can be changed by clicking, which is pretty standard.  I carry a smaller flashlight for every day carry in my pockets, but like this one because it has a little more heft. It's become the one I grab to walk my dogs at night. Because it's a little larger, it also stays cooler than my other lights, so I can run it longer without it becoming too warm.to hold. Don't get me wrong, it's not heavy at all and it's not huge, just a comfortable size to carry in my hand.

I've just begun using 18650 battery powered lights, and I'm impressed. I've had this a few weeks, using it about ten minutes each night now and haven't had to recharge the battery yet.

The construction seems sturdy, but I haven't tortured it since I like the way it looks and want it to stay that way. I got the bronze colored model because I like the color and so I can tell it from a similar black flashlight my wife uses.

I received a discount on the flashlight in return for my honest review but I'm not a shill - I really do like it and expect it to last a long time. I think it's a good value and would recommend it to anyone.",1

I have done a short video review and I will attach some photos of the product as well. I did receive this item free of charge in exchange for an honest review. So lets get right down to it.

Upon opening up the box from Prime, I was surprised to see that it was inside its own box with an instruction booklet. Pretty nice packaging for a mere water bottle. Opened it up to find that it was quite tall! This bottle holds 32oz of water, which is awesome. I drink a ton of water so honestly I do not like the majority of bottles you find in the store because they are a bit small. I won't need to fill this guy up as much. Cool bonus, because it is tall and not wide, it fits right in my car cup holder.

The bottle has a frosted and more grippy type of feel to it. It looks nice in gray and feels very well made. I was impressed with the build quality. It is plastic but it really feels like it's built to last. It has a really nice flip top lid with a gasket that keeps water from coming out of the mouth piece when it's closed. It also has a nice cloth handle so you can wear it on your wrist. The lid screws on tight and I have had no leakage even though I tossed it on the couch and on my car seat more than a few times.

Did I mention this is BPA free? It is. The bottle is made of Tritan plastic. From what I understand that means this thing is pretty much indestructible. I haven't tested it out but it just feels like this thing could be chucked out of a moving car at speed and would sustain no damage. I think I'll stick to using it hiking and fishing though.

Overall I think this is the nicest bottle I own and I own quite a few. I will definitely be buying another for my fiance and maybe another for myself.

Five stars.",1

This literally took 5 minutes to setup and boy does it look and work well!  It extends so I could get all my shoes on there and feels solid.  This is an honest review for which I did NOT receive anything free.,1
"This is a quality vise.
The clearance can be set by two allen key screws so all the play can be taken out if required.
The machining isn't perfect. If I go for zero clearance there are a few tight spots through the travel but certainly nothing that most people would complain about. If you need better machining than this you really should be looking at a lathe vise not a bench vise.
The screw thread is heavy duty wide acme screw type with about 1/8 of a turn free play. For a bench vise this is good enough and rarely an issue.
The guides are semi rough milled rather than smooth which is a bonus. That hold lubricant better and extends the life of the tool. When I say rough milled, it's smooth enough to not be felt by finger tips but rough enough to see and hold grease.
The anvil has also been milled flat as is required with forged processing.
The vise jaws are replaceable as are the pipe jaws. Not sure why they limited the clamping of the pipe jaws to 1/2 inch when there is easily the room to make them go down to 1/4 inch. The pipe jaws are also in the middle so cutting small pipe might present problems.

The only complaint I have so far is that very rough finish on the base for rotating the vise. They machined both surfaces so they slide across each other very smoothly but didn't machine the lock down section. So the lock down levers have less than 180Deg rotation need to be rotated a couple of times to get past the roughness before it will turn. Even then, they sometimes bind.
Crazy since they could have machined one more surface and gotten a very smooth system. As it is the two surfaces they have machined are negated as it still feels very rough to turn.
The base to vise clearance is crazy high. It's got about 2mm (over 1/16th) play. For machined surfaces this makes no sense.
It's almost like someone couldn't work out why the rotation was so rough so they increased the clearance instead of fixing the real problem, and machining the clamping surface.
I've dropped one star because of that and another because of the roughness in rotation.
If you need the swivel feature of the vise, I'd drop another star as it will drive you nuts in no time. I can't comment if this is my particular sample or it is a common aspect of the vise.
If you have a lathe it's easy enough to machine it back and make it smooth. You can also machine back the base to get rid of that excess play and make it very smooth and workable. This is how it should have been made.
If you don't (like me) you'll be stuck with a hard to rotate vise that has wild clearance in the base to vise surfaces.",1

"For the past few weeks I've gotten notice that my phone was charging poorly, and chocked it up to age or the charger. Turns out, I had crap cables. I've bought tons of cheap cables over the years, and I expected these to also just get me buy, but damn, these are some thick strong cables. They are thicker than the factory cables or even some of the ""Armor"" cables and such, and I've run them over with chairs, tucked them in pockets, and stepped on the ends accidently. Love it.

They are 6 feet long, so I didn't have to use an extender to use my phone while in bed charging, or connect to the charger under my desk without pulling.

They are thick, so they will take up more space when folded than your factory cable, but if you're throwing it into a laptop bag or backpack, no big deal.

I'll be ordering these again when I finally break them (if ever!). This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1
"I never buy shoes online so I was a little worried.  I am so glad I ordered them, they are simply adorable.

"I really love expandable hoses, since I do tons of gardening/landscaping projects.  But I seem to replace one or more each year.  So I decided to give the Easeetop 75 Foot Expandable Garden Hose a try, and here's my two cents so far.

-Great for the storage challenged: Shrinks down to next to nothing in size compared to a traditional hose.  Super easy for stashing when you are done using, and even better for storing over the long winter.
-Nice long length:  I upgraded from a 50 footer, and love the extra length of this.  Do yourself a favor, and go up a size or two larger than you think you need.
-No leaking: No annoying pinpoint holes yet, no leaking from either connection end (props for including extra washers).
-Serviceable sprayer: Does what is should, with a bunch of different spray patterns to choose from.  Pretty standard quality for what you usually get with these hoses.
-Solid brass?: If the hose ends are solid brass, they sure are light in weight.  The ends just look and feel cheaper than others I have (see below, left hose end is another brand, right hose is this one).  That said, this is working just fine.
-Keeping it real: From the clear plastic bag this comes in, to the plasticized brass looking ends, to the overall feel of the hose, this doesn't scream high end (yet comes with a hefty price tag).  I do wish there was an on/off switch on the end, like some other expandable hoses have.  And including instructions would be great too (not rocket science, but I've gained helpful tips from others like not storing fully pressurized, stretching sections before use, not drinking out of, etc.).

I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and I hope this is a helpful one too.  I take this seriously, since I too read reviews when deciding what to buy next (and I've bought my fair share of hoses)!  My bottom line: the Easeetop 75 Foot Expandable Garden Hose isn't necessarily my favorite yet, but is working like a champ where others have recently failed.",1

"Be fast and on target, and then run like hell; otherwise expect to be in a big hurt from people and animals. And here's a big secret: These kinds of spray do NOT hurt approx 5% of the population!

"After two hours, tech support, and borrowing a laptop to set up using the included USB cable, this thing would not connect to my network.  Yes I got a config report and put the IP address in Chrome but it was page not found every time.  It apparently was not the correct IP address.  I tried selecting my router in settings, hoping it would find it. Nope. Tech support told me a PC was needed even though this model was touted as being able to set up just using a Chromebook.  Well that's not true because you can't download drivers on Chromebook and it wouldn't set up with the IP address.  So I have to send it back and try to find something that can set up with just my Chromebook. Does anyone have any suggestions? My current printer is too old to work in the Cloud.  Gotta work WITHOUT need of a PC.  And my router does not have USB ports, tried that too.  Very disappointed.  And Samsung tech support was very disappointing. The last sentence before I was cut off was ""It really would have helped if you had a PC."". Nice.",0
If you are larger up top the shirt portion of this set will not work. The neckline is not stretchy enough for you to effectively nurse. The pants are pretty good. If the neckline was more stretchy this set could work. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.,1
"These headphones are amazing!!! The quality of the sound is amazing. They are wireless and work through Bluetooth. They also have functional buttons on them so you can talk on the phone wirelessly too. Let me tell you more about them.
Bluetooth connectivity: The way you connect the device is by holding the power button for five seconds. This makes the device discoverable and then you can find it on any device. I connected it to my laptop and my phone as well. Very easy connection. No problems here.
Sound: The quality of the sound here is amazing. To be honest, I have low expectation for bluetooth devices less than $50, but these really did surprise me. The bass really shows through when instrumentals are playing, and voices come through nice. I was most impressed with the sound on these headphones, and that's obviously the most important thing for me.

Phone; The quality when on the phone is so so, but it is very useful to be able to speak on the phone while running or in the car as long as these are connected to your phone. The speaker is built into the earpieces.

Buttons: I wasn't a huge fan of where these buttons are placed. They're all on the right side ear piece. One button is to pick up/hang up the phone OR pause/play music when music is playing. This button is small and kind of hard to find, but you get a little used to its position after the first few times. The volume button is on the back of the earpiece and is easier to use.

Fit: The earpiece fits nicely into the ear, and doesn't fall out while I was using it at the gym. Part of it is probably owed to the fact that they are light, as you can see the wire connected the two earpieces has nothing to weigh it down. It also comes with different size rubber in case it doesn't fit your ear well.

Overall, I am very pleased and impressed with these headphones. They are much cheaper than beats but quite frankly they work almost just as well. I would recommend them to anyone looking for some stylish wireless headphones!

It's beautiful and looks so bright outside. I love it! Great quality.,0
I bought this case in April...it is now the end of June ... I was so happy with this case until just a couple days ago when the ring just fell off. I am basically home bound right now ... I have been since the start of the year... So this case has not been misused in any way or over used!!! This is not an expensive case so I guess I should be Thankful it lasted that long . But unfortunately I'm not just into tossing dollar bills in the trash!!! So I guess I should have listened to all the bad reviews and spent my money on a better product.,0
These work like a charm!,0
"These boots are very simple but exactly what I was looking for.  They are a very dark navy blue and look very nice with blue jeans or a pair of white leggings. I ordered a size 7, and they fit nicely.  They are very lightweight and don't look cheap.  They are slouchy and they are super comfortable.  They aren't the highest quality, but they are great for the price.  They offer many different colors and materials.  I would definitely recommend these.  I received this item at a discount for a fair and honest review.",1

Exactly as shown!!!! So happy to be using for new house! 1st time trying Amazon! Very happy I received my stuff!,0
"Product Review: FIZZION Pet Stain & Odor Remover (Fragrance Free) Tablets
Use this Amazon link if you decide to purchase this product online and would like to support Big Spring News: http://amzn.to/2bUgmc1
Key Findings: Big Spring News recommends FIZZION Pet Stain & Odor Remover (Fragrance Free) Tablets after thorough testing of the product locally has confirmed outstanding neutralization of pet odors and good cleaning performance on a variety of surfaces. It is also a money saver in comparison to premixed products on retail aisle shelves. And, very important to some with sensitivities to fragrances, it indeed has a very mild scent reminiscent of lemony-lime sparkling seltzer water. Big Spring News has experienced an impressive and unexpected reduction in unwanted marking behavior over the course of approximately one month of use of the FIZZION product! In the Amazon link above, fragrance free Fizzion is represented as being, ""Non-toxic and safe to use around your animals and children""--however, common sense demands that one not let children and/or pets ingest or otherwise be exposed to it as the package label warns, ""KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN. May cause eye irritation.""
In early July, Big Spring News purchased a bottle of Clorox Urine Remover For Stains and Odors to address pet accidents/""on purposes"" only to find that its odor was so powerful and so long-lasting as to make it extremely unpleasant to use. This set off a very serious hunt for a fragrance free pet urine remover. Big Spring News eventually found the Fizzion Fragrance Free product and requested and received a sample pack of eight tablets from the manufacturer to forward this review.
Big Spring News purchased a new spray bottle in order to prevent any cross-contamination with residual chemicals. Per the label's instructions, 23 ounces of warm [Reverse Osmosis, not Big Spring tap!] water was poured into the spray bottle and one Fizzion tablet was removed from its hermetic wrapper and added to the water. The tablet immediately began to release bubbles similar to how an Alka-Seltzer disc might effervesce circa 1971. After a brief time, the reaction was complete and the spray top mechanism was installed on the bottle.
Initial use of Fizzion Fragrance Free was both a surprise and a delight: a surprise in that the product has a very mild, pleasing scent, but a delight in that that scent is due to the product's ingredients [baking soda, citric acid, oxidizers, and cleaning surfactants] and not added artificial fragrances.
Big Spring News compared Fizzion Fragrance Free to the aforementioned Clorox product; white vinegar; and bleach diluted with water on a variety of surfaces including tile, wood, and pet bedding and found Fizzion Fragrance Free to afford superior odor neutralization. As an example, one spot on a 'marked' dog bed was lightly sprayed with Fizzion Fragrance Free, wiped with a paper towel, and then lightly sprayed again and allowed to dry. After a period of time [overnight] the problem spot of the bed was smell tested and, remarkably, no urine odor was detectable.
Big Spring News gave Fizzion Fragrance Free tablets to three other pet owning families so as to include cats and other dogs. All volunteer testers agreed that the Fizzion Fragrance Free works well. One tester texted: ""I used it [Fizzion Fragrance Free] on many different stains and surfaces! And like it. I am always skeptical of any cleaner I haven't used before but so far I am not having any odd reactions. Good stuff especially on windows or glass, which is a favorite place for one of my pets to spray.""
As mentioned, Big Spring News received a sample pack of Fizzion Fragrance Free, but Big Spring News also purchased an additional package of 8 Fizzion Fragrance Free tablets from Amazon with the delivered price being about $2.50 for each tablet. It seems like a bargain for a pet odor removing product which does work and is fragrance free. Again, use this Amazon link if you decide to purchase this product online and would like to support Big Spring News: http://amzn.to/2bUgmc1
Big Spring News believes that after going through more than 100 ounces/ five tablets, an unexpected and significant reduction in marking behavior has been realized. While no scientific testing was conducted to support this observation, could it be possible that some sort of positive feedback loop which feeds marking contests between pets is interrupted with effective odor neutralization?

I love this dress! It looks and feels great!,0
"Very sleek compact design, but did have scratches on the outside when I opened it. It's just the right size to fit in any purse and not overly bulky or hard to carry. Overall it is a great product! all my cards fit and puts everything in one place! I did receive this product for free.",1
It works great. I use it everyday,0
"Very good product.
Practical and resistant.",0
"Terrible design! It is not secure. After 15 mins of riding half of the mount fell off, which led to me running over my cell phone & cracking the screen. I should have known better for the price point. Def will invest in a better quality mount.",0
"I love the look and feel of this case. The sides are very smooth, the credit card holder slots can hold a couple of card (I have my daughters kids club cards in it). My phone feels very protected in this case. I played games for a while on it last night and It was comfortable to hold, very slim fitting case. I received this case for free and would definitely recommend it to anyone.",1
"Did the job! I bought it for my save the date cards and they were perfect. I didn't really have to cut really hard to get these into small pieces to use. All I had to do was slightly scratch the magnet and bent it to create smaller pieces. I tested it on the refrigerator and it holds pretty well light weight papers. Not sure about using it for anything heavier though. But, overall, awesome product for me!",0
"I didn't realize just how big and amazing this large picnic blanket is.  I took it to the river with us yesterday for a picnic and even though the kids were swimming and then standing on the blanket, I was able to shake the sand right off of it.  I want to mention the size again because if you've ever been on a picnic and need a place to put the food and allow for everyone to sit while eating, this is the picnic blanket for you.  It's so nice and roomy, I can't stress that enough.  It's super easy to care for and it's going to come in handy all summer long as we are an outdoor family.  I would give this a higher rating than a 5 if I could.  I received a product sample for review purposes.",1
"Disclaimer: I received this product for free in return for my honest review!

"I love these compression pants!  They are great quality, very thick and durable!
I love that they promote muscular endurance, help relieve muscle soreness, accelerate performance and promote healthy circulation and I love the way they fit!  They help suck in everything which I desperately need :)  They are the perfect workout pants, great for running, yoga, tennis, pretty much any sport or fitness activity you could think of.  I'm very excited about these pants and very pleased with this purchase.  I would highly recommend them.  Shipping was fast and as expected.  These are a little tight which is to be expected with compression pants, so they're perfect!

I received this item for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My review is not influenced by this discount in anyway.

"We used our FoodSaver for the first time this weekend, and I love it!

It was incredibly well packed, and the instructions for use were super simple.",0
I am a size 12-14 and I bought a 3X.  It fits perfectly. If you follow the size chart I found it to work wonderfully.  I love the suit!  This is just what I needed. I never really liked one-pieces as I like to show some skin and get color. Sometimes a straight bikini is not the greatest look for me either. This is the perfect comprimise.  This covers up just the right places and makes them look good while still showing off a bit. I have always been a fan of vintage clothes and was thrilled to find this at such a reasonable price.  The material is quality and durable. I had a hard time choosing which color to pick as they were all lovely.  The top is great for me as I am not that busty. This top works with that and gave me a balanced look.  My 19-year-old daughter even said it looked good and she really doesn't notice too much about my clothes. : ) I would recommend this product as well as the company because of the quality. I was given a discount for an honest review. This is truly my feelings on this product.,1
Great game for the family.  Very easy to use and a good variety to keep the kids busy.  Also great for travel.  Nice and sturdy.,0
"I bought these for my 2 1/2 year old son. We can't seem to keep him in shoes that fit for anything. :)

Pros:
*Super cute color choices! I had a hard time deciding which one to get. I finally asked my son which ones he wanted, and he wanted them all. I ordered them in Blue.
*I love that these sandals come in half sizes. I bought a 9.5 and the size seems to be spot on.
*Excellent quality!
*Sandals are lightweight but sturdy.
*Close toe is great for my son who tends to be clumsy.
*Good grip on the soles.
*Comfortable to wear.
*There is a velcro strap behind the heel that can be adjusted.
*Fabric on top of the foot is breathable mesh.
*Shoes clean up easily.
*Sometimes my son has a hard time getting shoes to fit because of a high instep. These fit perfectly!
*LOVE these sandals!

Cons:
*None.

I'm very impressed with these sandals and my son loves them! They look fabulous and are sturdy and look like they'll last a long time. 5 stars for Zicoope!

"I received Trianium Clear Case for iPhone 5 for testing and promised that my review would be fair and honest.

After receiving my case within a few days, I was beyond excited because I finally can switch up the case that I've had for so long.

I love that the case is clear so that you can see my iphone 5 beneath it. Although I can see where the buttons are and everything with the clear case, it is bit tough to press the volume buttons. You kind of have to put a bit of force. The hard shell of the case keeps my phone protected and safe -- but I have yet to drop it, let's just hope it doesn't crack!

Somehow it got dirty with some sticky residue, but it was easy to clean with just the wipe of a finger.

Overall, I love it and it's one of my favorite cases!",1
"These bulbs arrived extremely well packaged. The three bulbs arrived in a small sized sturdy box, inside the Amazon box, wrapped in bubble wrap. Then each bulb is in an individual box with a form fitting plastic shield to keep it in place. I replaced one bulb in my office floor lamp with one of the LED Chandelier Bulbs so I could tell the difference in the quality of the light. I found the new LED to be a nice quality white light compared to my original basic bulb, which was more of a dull yellowish light. My photo didn't turn out as expected, but the new LED is in the bottom blue lampshade. I am very pleased with these bulbs and would definitely purchase them in the future.

"I want start off by saying thank you for the fast shipping! I have been looking for something to help my daughters feet pain.  She had double foot surgery to remove extra bones from her feet. Since the surgery she has had pain and numbness in that area. I bought these to see how they will and do ,and she loves them. She wears them during her gym class and while she is running. If her feet start hurting she will throw them on and wear them. It comes with-

Pair of Compression Foot Sleeve
Pair of Arch Support/Plantar Fasciitis Therapy Wrap
Pair of Plantar Fasciitis Silicone Gel Heel Protectors/Shock Absorbing Heel Support, Comfort Gel Cushions

I will be buying more to have even if i throw them in my car.

"I love these ~ they look so pretty worn out with the right outfit...or you know, they look fabulous to wear at home too...but I have actually been looking for one that fits some basic needs to go with a Victorian costume I am wearing for a themed party.  I don't want to spend too much (obviously) but I want it to look classy, not cheap (obviously).  I saw this and thought I would give it a try ~ the price is great (15.88 at the time of this review) and it looked classy, and it fit well with my costume since it has the vintage style hook in the front.  I am so happy with it I just purchased a second one!

Edit:  I DID purchase a second one ~ these are just SO nice!  The second one I purchased in XL (GULP) but it is better.  The lacing in the back works great to pull it in where you need and this one just fits better and feels better.  (More on sizing below!)

Manufacture:

Very pleased with the way this is made.  All of the stitching is straight and tight.  Lace lines up properly as do clasps.  Everything is even.  The back flap (to make sure skin is hidden if you need to loosen the back ribbons) is connected tightly, no fear of it ripping.  Front hooks securely fastened and everything meets up and attaches properly.  Eyelets for laces are all tight. Inside is soft and ""boning"" is securely covered.  Nothing is itchy or picky.

Sizing:

Ok - this needs to just stop with these crazy small sizes for US sizes.  The only thing worse than having to order a bathing suit 2 sizes larger than normal would be lingerie 2-3 sizes larger than normal.  Uummm helloooo ~ I think it is a secret conspiracy to make all US women want to jump off a bridge.  But, if you really want this to fit nicely go by their insane measurements, take a really deep breath (cause it will be ok and no one ever has to know) and order 2 to...gulp 3 sizes bigger.  This one I ordered a large and when trying it on I was worried I would have to loosen the ribbons so much the under flap would not cover.  Now, it DID work out, but JUST.  So - the second one I ordered is an XL.  I wear a straight medium.  Often if it is just a top I wear a small.  Size 5/6 on the top.  So...order up.  I think for most people 2 sizes should work ok and go by the measurements because they seem pretty on spot.  Also if you fall at different places on the chart - like your waist is medium but bust is small - go with your waist measurement.  I really, really wish they would get this sizing down a little bit better because I do not really love buying lingerie 2 sizes bigger than normal.  But it will be worth it just to hold your breath and do it because this is really a very pretty corset.

What is nice with the sizing is the back ties ~ if your waist is medium you can tighten this right up at the top and it will still lay the way it is supposed to.  It is perfectly made to really look good on any body shape..they just need to not kill our self esteem before we've even bought it!

I can't speak for anyone else, but I take my reviews seriously ~ I hope I have given some information that that has helped you out! I received this product at a discount for my honest and accurate review but I am not obligated to leave a positive review, nor do I receive any incentives or monetary compensation to do so. I would hope my review is not disregarded just because of this because it is truthful & sincere. My goal is to help buyers understand aspects of an item I would like to know before purchase. I am not affiliated with any company and am a normal consumer just like you. I pick items to review that I would normally want to purchase. (I don't do reviews for things I would already deem to be junk). I would never write a review for a product that is anything but my personal opinion and I have already purchased the product, nothing changes for me based on my review, but hopefully the time I put into writing can help someone out. Hope I was able to help ~ and please don't hesitate to ask me a question about any of the products I've reviewed; I am happy to help if I can!",1

"I received this review sample  for evaluation.

This product exceeded my expectations ! Even though it wasn't tempered glass, the ultra soft film is just as easy to apply and smooth to use.

What really surprised me is that the product came with TWO sprays instead of the usual one. The Squeegee was has a bump through the middle for easy grip, which came in handy when I tried to get rid of those air bubbles!",1
"This was an easy install! The microphone works great, little to no background noise is picked up.",0
"I purchased these 2 LED LED Dog tags for when we go camping with our 2 black dogs. Each LED tag is lightweight and has two lights. The tags have three light settings: alternate flashing, blinking, and steady-on. Each tag came with batteries already installed and the tags also come with four extra batteries. The tags have bright LED lights, making them easy to spot on your dog at night.

The tags have two screws holding the front and back pieces together, however you would only need to remove these two screws in order to change the batteries. There is a sticky paper label on the back on each tag, which might be nice to write some of your contact info on, but if the tag became dirty or wet, there is now way the ink would remain legible or the sticky paper label would stay on.  I'm going to try to cover the labels with a large piece of clear packing tape and hope for the best.

The tags have a foam disc at the bottom of each tag, and there were NO instructions with the tags to explain the purpose of this disc.  After messing with it a bit, I realized it was more than likely a cushion the manufacturer puts on the tags to protect the lights from turning on in shipping.  The tags are easy to turn on by simply clicking a button to change the lights, and you can change from steady to flashing by pressing the button repeatedly until it will then cycle around to ""off"".

The lobster clasp seems to stay closed well, but it is a little tough to open - so it might be more of a pain to attach and detach the tag each day if you plan on using it often. One of my larger dogs seemed to be bothered by the size of this tag bouncing on his collar, but he got used to it after a while, but I suspect that some smaller dogs may be really bothered by the size of the tags.

I am pretty happy with this product overall, but I only plan to use these tags while we are camping with our dogs. Our dogs are ""water dogs"" and I'm unsure as to their durability if worn while a dog is swimming and with no instruction manual I guess I'll have to just see what happens.

"I received thes Ella's Closet tutu in pink and it is really cute and exceeded my expectations. It is made very well; I like the satin type fabric that is around the waistband. The waistband is elastic and stretches a good amount, making it able to fit multiple sizes. It fits my 7 year old girl greatly. It has several layers and in this color it wasn't see through. However I could see some of the lighter colors requiring shorts of some kind to go under it. I definitely recommend this tutu and I've previously purchased from Ella's Closet and have been pleased with the quality. I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review of the product. I guarantee my honesty as I myself rely on other reviews before making a purchase online.",1
I love this package of LED tea light candles. I like using LED candles around the house for safety reasons and these were perfect. The fact they're submersible in water allows them to be so versitile with decorating. Right now I have a few of them in some tea light holders and they work great! They came with the batteries included which was a huge plus. The only drawback on these is the way you have to turn them on and off. You have to twist them. There's no on/off switch. I have to unscrew them just enough to turn them off and screw them in enough to turn them on. They're still beautiful though so it isn't a deal breaker. I love the bright white light they give also as opposed to a yellow light a lot of LED lights give. They may not look as realistic with the white light but these are exactly what I love! They are gorgeous and bright. *discount received for testing and review*,1
"My family enjoys camping.  Most tent stakes are silver, and difficult to see on the ground when you take down your tent.  These are are a bright orange/red, so are easy to see if you have forgotten to pick one up at your campsite.

"we own the Rex & use it everyday! It fits our active lifestyle and we love the clip that makes it hands free. And with its small size, you don't notice that you're carrying addt'l weight. When I saw that the pro w/ station was on sale, $29.95, we took advantage of it!

Pros: 1.quality sound for its size
2. Small, rugged, h2o proof, & truly portable. We clip it and go hiking or the beach.
3. Bass station does add more bass for a small unit and sounds nice in low-mid volumes

Cons: 1. Not really pure and loud as described (reason why it lost s star)
2. I don't get the hums or additional sounds in the bass station, as described in other reviews. The issue I have is that the BASS dock has to be plugged into an outlet for it to work. Not sure why a portable speaker would have a non-portable accessory. Also, if you're looking for a portable for the house, office, or group gatherings; take a look at the: Riva Turbo X, Riva S, Bose Sound Link Mini II, Oontz 3xl, or the UE2/megaboom.
3. The ""grill"" is on uneven and can't be evened out. Looks like an quality issue

Overall, the 4 star rating is based on portability,  ruggedness, and most importantly the $29.95 price. At its original price, I'd give it 2-stars.",0
"This dog bowl is so convenient! My dog is a snob when it comes to those doggy fountains at dog parks so I usually have to bring a cup full of water or a water bottle so she has some water when she plays. My dog reacted well to the collapsible bowl and really likes it. Its super easy to keep, I added a hook to it so I can just clip it onto my backpack when we go hiking or onto my purse when we go to the dog park.

It's easy to understand but also has features that make it easy to connect devices to. I love that the face plate comes off and has a storage case and that it's very convenient to use. Here are a couple features I really like:

- Bluetooth: This device has bluetooth calling and music capabilities. Additionally, it has a hands-free calling system which includes a built in mic. My old car stereo never had that!

-AM/FM Stereo Radio: In case you you want to play music from an iPod or any device without bluetooth, this stereo has an aux connection. It can hold up to 30 stations in it's memory and has USB flash drive and  SD memory card readers.

- Connect & Stream Audio from External Devices:When you look at the connections on the back of the stereo, there are three audio ports, as well as an amplifier connection. The audio ports are great for connecting DVD players to the audio system and really making the car a DVD experience for the passengers.

As far as installation, this stereo was decently easy to install. We bought a crimp set, a factory connector set of wires and a face plate adapter. Most often when novice installation is done, a person simply cuts the wires to a radio and then twists the new ones together. However, this can be VERY dangerous and cause issues down the road. So it's best to get a crimp set to secure each of the wires and a factor set of cables to correctly attach the stereo wires to the car. On the back of the stereo you can see the location where the connectors should be. The face plate adapter is because the radio doesn't fit perfectly in the car without something to hold it in.

Overall, I like this car stereo. It's versatile and has all the features that I could want to use to play music and have hands free calling in my car. I love the remote and the removable face plate as additional useful features. With the proper tools, a careful and proper installation can be done. We are very happy with this car stereo and can't wait to use it more!

"I LOVE this dog car seat cover! It is perfect for my car! I usually would use blankets on my seats that my dogs easily clawed to the side leaving pet hair everywhere. I travel many places with my dog and the pet hair is not the only thing that has ruined my seats. From throw up to slobber or them even chewing on my belt buckle(UGH!) this seat cover will prevent all of those things from me having to continuously clean my car out! It makes it even better that it is waterproof! I love how the sides go up and even that the one door side unzips to get them in and out easier. I highly recommend this for ANY one that owns animals.

I have had my Galaxy S5 for over a year, used daily without any form of screen protector. Samsung screen are suppose to be scratch resistant to a point so I never though to put one on it until I dropped my phone and wouldn't you know I know have a scratch on the left lower side of my screen.

This tempered glass screen is very easy to install and comes with everything you need. It includes the screen protector, an alcohol cleaning wipe, micro fiber clothe and a dust removal sticker. Clean the screen of your phone with the alcohol pad and dry with the micro fiber clothe, remove any remaining dust or fibers with the dust removal sticker, then slowly lower the screen protector making sure to line it up correctly, then press the center of the screen down with little pressure and you will see it start to adhere itself to the phone screen. The air bubbles if installed correctly with disappear on their own. I wiped the screen off immediately with the microfiber clothe to remove my finger prints and applied a little pressure just for piece of mind the protector was fully adhered.

As soon as I installed the protector I was amazed at just how much clearer and more vivid my phone screen became. It may have a lot to do with cleaning the phone thoroughly before installing but the colors seem to be brighter and more vivid and the screen look a lot clearer.

"Pay attention to the product description.  My guess, that is why so many 4 star reviews, read them.  These stools are descibed correctly, but when they arrived, I, for one, was shocked ..They are soo tiny.  Well made.  Nice.  Light wgt. for outdoor carrying, easy to store. Large one hold 200lbs, small one 110 lbs.  But small, did I say that ?  When I opened the box, my wife said ""Are they for our chihuahuas ?""  If you look at the pictures I supplied, the ""large"" red stool has a Coke can for comparison, and the other is my adult daughter, sitting on the smaller one.  Almost brings a smile to my face, it is so small but it held up.  .

"I am extremely happy with this product. Easy set up, easy cleanup. It comes with the smores maker, a can of fuel (45 minute burn time) , two smores sticks and a protective scree that covers the burning fuel. This is a great alternative to a bonfire for roasting marshmallows. The fuel is safe to use indoors or out so if you want a smore in the dead of winter you can make one. Make sure you only use the smores heat fuel with this product, other fuels are not appropriate for the plastic maker. It has places to put graham crackers, chocolate and marshmallows to have ready for your next smore and two smores making stations. You can put a graham cracker down with a piece of chocolate and when your marshmallow is roasted to perfection you simply grab another graham cracker and use it to pull your marshmallow off the stick to complete your snack. The simple design works well and is pretty straightforward to use. I highly recommend this product.

It's no to bad little hard,0
"First Impression:
These earphones are your typical softened rubber.  Even with the ear hooks, they seemed a bit unstable when I first put them in.  Getting these synced with my phone was as simple as my phone bluetooth interface sync (which, for me, is sporadic-- but that is not the fault of the headphones).  Otherwise, the buttons were easy to figure out.  And the voice in the earbud informs you along the way (however, mine was missing the ready to sync message which the instructions told me to anticipate).

Then, I went for a run:
Please note, I did not charge them beyond the arrival charge initially.  When I first ran, the sound intermittently cut out if my phone was on my forearm rather than my bicep.  The audio quality is otherwise good.  But, realizing that I didn't give it the fair shake of a full charge-- I charged them up for another day.

Second Run:
This time, I had no problems with sound cutting out.  The battery life was plenty for my hour run, and two hours hanging out poolside listening to audiobooks later that day.  The sound quality is still good.

HOWEVER:
These headphones are missing an auto-shut-off.  A bit after I came home from the pool, I received a call that I could not answer-- only to realize that my headphone were still synced and on.  While this was my mistake... it did allow me to confirm on my walk the next day, that the intermittent sound issues are expected for these headphones after moderate batter draining.  I would say that these gave me 4 hours of playback before they started cutting out.

THE GOOD:
I will continue to use these headphones, with regular charging.  They stay in place comfortably.  The sound is comparable to more expensive ear buds.  They function well for their purpose.

"This review is an honest response in spite of it being given in response to free product for the review.

UPDATE: Three days after the previous review I received a replacement from the seller. Great service so I added a star. I will keep you posted as to the status of this set of headphones. Stay tuned....

On the positive side, I will make these points:
1. It is waterproof. This is extremely helpful in Florida where showers pop up and are heavy.
2. It works well in answering a phone call. Caller didn't even know I was on a headset.
3. It can be worn with glasses (sun or prescription), and a hat!
4. The controls are very easy to use.
5. If phones drop the audio port, Bluetooth will be mandatory. It is nice not getting tangled in the iPhone earbud cable.
On the negative side:
1. I have used them for a week and the right channel stopped working for some reason. The unit was fully charged.
Again, this review is not swayed by the product I received for this.",1
"This looks very funny when you first get it like it might have just been some gag but it works.  The phone will only fit in the clip on way but the head rotates so that you can have your phone in a vertical or horizontal position. The set up was very easy just plug it in and find a radio station. I set the radio to scan until the phones audio started coming through then I set it as a permanent setting. I made calls using this feature and it worked very well there was a bit of static through the radio but not enough to mess with the call quality. I would only use the function when alone because there is no privacy with the call coming through the radio.  The phones music player worked through this as well no need to keep changing the CD the entire lay list from your phone is readily available. Even with this plugging into the lighter adapter you can still charge your phone because the slot for USB is on the side and it is a fast charger.  Good all-around piece that works well in my car but not so much in my van because it is short and sits a little low for my taste while in the van.
This product was purchased for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review. The price of the product had no influence on how the final review was written. Things to affect my review:
1 did product look as expected? Yes
2. Will this work for my family? Yes
3. Was it worth the original purchase price? Yes
4. Will I buy it again? Yes
5. Is the product going to last the daily use from my family?  Has a lot of movable parts but they seem to be well put together. It should last for quite some time

"I was a bit disappointed when I received this on Monday. For one it was supposed to be here on Sunday as I used my two day shipping from my Amazon prime instead of foregoing the two day shipping and getting a 5.99 credit for Prime Pantry. So that was a bummer. Secondly the upper left side was crinkled up some where in the process of making this and cant be fixed or smoothed out and in the Sunday column there is a scratch that is underneath the top covering. But I do love that the magnet is nice and strong. It is also the perfect size for the top part of my refrigerator and colors really pop off the black background and wipe off really easily and completely. It will work for my needs and the fact that I received it at a discounted price for writing a honest review after purchasing it and using it, I won't be returning it because of the stated defects. If I had paid full price I would be returning it for sure, But I would be asking for a replacement not my money back as I do like the product. I deducted a star because of day late delivery and another star for the defects.",1
"Perfect replacements for our light strand.  We wanted to put LED lights in our light strand that goes around our doorway into our courtyard; however, the price to do that was prohibitive compared to the price of a set of these bulbs.  These were well packaged and arrived in perfect condition.  They also matched the other bulbs in the strand perfectly.  You can't tell which one's we have replaced.  If you need G40 bulbs for your outdoor lights, I would definitely recommend these.",0
"This is a great case.  The material feels nice and soft and the color matches the picture on the amazon website.  It has a magnetic flap that comes over the right edge to keep it closed.  The interior has a couple card slots and a ID slot.  I had no issues fitting three credit cards and my driver's license in here.  There's also a slot to put some cash in behind the credit card slots.

The actual part the phone snaps in to appears to be made of a flexible plastic material.  It snaps on to the phone and fits snug but perfectly.  The cutouts for the buttons are all aligned properly and the buttons are easily depressed.

Overall, this is a great case.  I got it so that I can throw some cards and money in this with my phone when I don't want to take my whole wallet out for the day if Im going to a concert or festival of some sort.  I can throw this in my pocket and have everything I need.

"Sometimes I feel products illustrated and marketed by HTC, Oculus, Samsungs Gear VR and other VR on shelf to buy is bit over-rated and looting consumer into buying same product as BLISSTIME.  This VR was shipped over to me so quickly and the product was well packaged.  Absolutely exceeded my expectation of 3D VR, I use this VR almost every day and provides comfort to wear for longer period of time and it is light weight.

No doubt I felt as the movie screened in 3D view.  For example, there was a video I used to first trial on this product which was riding on a rollercoaster and providing me same enthusiasm on this product as if I was in theme park with my Samsung phone.  The sound blasted and the movement of roller coaster was right on the dot.
I even let my wife who has IPhone use this and now she wants her pair of own and most likely will re-purchase from this seller, as it was well packed and provided insightful instructions to follow as a guide for newbies like me.

"This Simply Modern insulated bottle is just what I needed!  The bottle has a really smooth finish, and theres also glitter in the finish.  It fits perfectly in my SUV cup holder.  Comparing it to the Swell bottle this one holds an additional 2 ounces.  Which is awesome because I use a lot of bottles of water (which are 16.9 oz), so it was annoying they wouldnt fit into my previous insulated tumbler.  The insulated bottle does not sweat while being left in the car when I have errands to run on hot days. It kept my cold drink cold for hours.  It also seals tight, so it can be tossed into a bag without fear that it will leak.  Such a nice feature!  The bottle is BPA free, and is a hand wash only bottle (which most of them are nowadays).  I don't drink coffee, and with it being summer I have not tested its ability to keep liquids warm.

Simply stated the Simply Modern bottle holds 17 ounces, keeps your drink cold or warm for hours, does not leak or sweat comes in a variety of stylish colors, and fits perfectly in your car cup holder.

"I received this swimsuit for free to test and evaluate.

The suit is a bit hard to get on. To get it on requires stepping into the neck and pulling it up over my body. This felt like an awkward motion at first, but the suit is able to be worn easily.

I have larger thighs and I was concerned that the boy short cut wouldn't work on me or would be uncomfortable, but the suit fit. The legs are not as compressing as I expected, and they hit at a spot that was both modest and flattering. This is a suit that I will be wearing with confidence. It is a suit that was very nearly swiped by a niece who saw it because she only wants to go to the pool in a pair of shorts and a tank top.

This suit has formed cups that fit my chest correctly. It has enough support without being overly compressing. No cleavage in this suit, which is fine with me. My butt is also modestly covered. Another bonus.

A few cons to consider, if you need to pee, you need to take this suit all the way down to do it. This suit doesn't have special compression in the stomach area so you could look a little pouchy there if you are not in shape. You have to step in and pull this up, if you are a larger gal, this might be a problem for you because the fabric has give, but the fabric does not have excessive give. It is easier to pull on than a pair of panty hose or an extra tight girdle, but is harder than a regular suit where you just step into the bottom and tie the top or fasten the top behind your back. This top does not open, you must step in through the top.",1
"I really love this lanyard. It is so gosh darn attractive and put together nicer than the cheapy ones I've been using, you know, the ones that look like they're made out of shoestrings.

A wonderful way to wear your bus pass, work ID, keys, tickets, etc. around your neck. I like using mine for my bus pass. When I'm going to be out all day, and using it a lot, I don't have to keep digging to get it out of my purse or stopping to put it back in again.

This Fashion Lanyard makes a great gift for any of your female friends who wear ID's at work.

I honestly thought it was one of those hoses you see on the commercials that ""grow"" and it kind of does but the quality seems so much better.

"Review for MiamiSalesTeam
Floral Girl Baby Dress 3-Piece Romper Set - Adorable Matching Baby Girl Outfit
First off, my apologies for not reviewing this adorable 3 piece outfit sooner. Our Michigan summer took FOREVER to get here this year (and who knows if it's really here now either!) and there was absolutely no weather that was good enough to truly appreciate this outfit. Today my daughter turned 11 months old and it is 80 degrees outside so I got this outfit out for her 11 month pictures. This is a three piece set that comes with a dress top, bloomer like diaper cover and a headband. The set is done in a super cute pink floral pattern with lots of bows and ruffles. I am posting pictures to show how adorable this outfit is. The only thing I disliked about it is the back of the dress portion is so much shorter than the front. I feel like there is too much opportunity for the diaper to show through since there is not fabric and the diaper cover doesn't cover the entire height of the diaper. Also since it is longer it the front it impedes crawling efforts made by the baby.
This set is made out of 97% knitted cotton fabric and 3% spandex. It is machine washable and can be dried in the dryer. The directions do state not to bleach, line dry or iron.
I received this set free of charge in exchange for an honest review.",1

"I love the new style of mermaid tails and shark blankets. When I saw this mermaid tail, I had to have it. This mermaid tail is the softest mermaid tail blanket I have ever used. It is simply fantastic. It is extremely soft. It is premium quality stitching and the seams are extremely smooth. The durability of the seams are premium quality. This mermaid tail is excellent for adults and teens. It is also a nice size for kids. There is a storage pocket on the inside of this mermaid tail. When you are wrapped up in this mermaid blanket you get to feel very cozy and comfortable. This is a one-size-fits-most. It is a nice large blanket. The blanket has a nice large extra wide waist. It is comfortable for adults, teens, and children. Children can use it as a sleeping bag, and adults can use it all the way up to their waist. The inside of the blanket is lined with beautiful sherpa material. I couldn't believe it had this beautiful extra detail. I was so excited and couldn't believe how soft it was. This is such a fun blanket to use. You can use it as your throw blanket or you can use it as a super soft plush blanket to wrap yourself up in. I love this mermaid tail. It's so far is my favorite. I've had several others that have been made of cheap material and very thin quality. Not this time. This tail is truly plush and is worth every penny spent. I highly recommend this mermaid tail if you're looking for one for that special someone.

Great Little hooks!  I use them to hold up a wire sponge basket in my kitchen sink.  I have textured tile around my old kitchen sink and suction cups just don't work.  I've tried 3M command hooks (even the waterproof kind) and they kept falling off.  I found these little hooks while searching for a new solution and they do the job!  The actual metal hook on these does swivel which can be useful in lots of applications.  I only wish the hook didn't bend out quite as far.  In what I'm using it for it causes the baskets to lean forward a bit more than I'd like but overall I'm happy they are staying in place even with all the water around.  They are very handy and I'm trying to find uses for the rest of my hooks now!  I've attached some pictures.  I did receive this item at a discounted price for my honest review.

"I got this for my 2 year old chihuahua, who typically destroys new toys almost instantly.  He often rips them apart with ease.  Since he likes playing tug, I thought this would be a great new toy for him.  It is on the small side, but since my dog is very small, that was not a problem.  He has loved it since I first gave it to him.  The braided style of the rope keeps to together and seems very durable.

"My finicky cats like this particular flavor (Cod, Sole amd Shrimp - Classic), but Purina only offers it in combination with two other flavors in boxes of 12, 24 and grater.  And, of course they don't like those other two flavors.  But, via Amazon I can order a whole case of 24 of just the Cod, Sole & Shrimp for about the same cost per can that I would pay at grocery stores.  And, wet cat food is one of the heavier items I would just as soon not haul home from the store.

One of my cats has had all her teeth removed years ago and she really would yowl when her gums would come down on a piece of fish bone.

I am not sure if this mouse pad is licensed, but I don't care. I have been without a mouse mat for a while now, ever since I got a Logitech mouse that works on every surface. But the mouse gets pretty gross just being used on the desk, so it was time for a new one. And I love me some Majora's Mask, so this is a great addition to my gamin rig! I apologize in advance if my three mouse mat reviews look similar - they all came from Schoolsupplies, and they are all the same pad only with different designs on them.

+ Looks great. The art is awesome. I love Majora's Mask, and this reminds me of a tattoo design I want, so it's pretty awesome.
+ Durable. Seems to be made from good rubber and the design is painted on instead of laminated so I don't think it will peel. I'll update the review it if does, for sure!
+ Arrived quickly. Even though this seller is in Asia, I got it MUCH faster than estimated. Good job, ""schoolsupplies""!

- It's a bit thin. This is a trend now, but I'm used to thick mouse pads. So I guess this isn't a ""minus"" so much as a ""you young kids with your thin mouse pads and hippity hop music"". Imagine me shaking my cane at you as you pass by my front porch. So no deduction for what was obviously a design choice.

"I mounted the camera to the base and plugged it into the power supply. I then downloaded the Foscam app.  It told me that the firmware needed to be updated as I have had this camera for about 7 months and I had not updated the camera.  I told it to go ahead and update the firmware. When the firmware was updated I opened the app and I could see the camera image on my iPhone 6S Plus. I set this camera up and I have never had to connect this camera to my network using an Ethernet cable. I am only using my WIFI. I did have to enter my SSID for my WIFI and my WIFI password.

I unplugged the camera and inserted a 32 GIG class 10 Sandisc memory card into the camera and I repowered the camera back up. I put the small CD Rom disc into my computer and looked over the manual and I installed the IP camera locating software. It found two Foscam cameras as I already had another model installed in an office. I set up the computer software to view both cameras simultaneously and I went into the camera settings.  I programmed both cameras to record alarm events on the internal SD card and when the card is full I told them to overwrite the oldest recording.

I programmed the C1 camera to email me when an alarm occurred and to send me photos of what it saw that caused the alarm. It worked flawlessly.  When the camera sees motion in the programmed target area it beeps three times and warns the intruder that they are being monitored. It immediately sends me the three photos and it continues to do this as long and the intruder is in front of the camera and moving. I set the camera up to listen to sound and I can hear the intruder talking and when I use my smart phone I can talk to them using the hold to talk button.

The photos and the videos are very good and clear. I can adjust the quality of the photos and videos using the smart phone app or the software on my PC. I am not having the problem with poor quality photos and videos that others are complaining about. I can also view both the new C1 camera and an older Foscam camera on my PC in live video. I can playback the recorded videos on the Micro SD cards and see what was recorded when the alarms went off. Everything works as you would expect it to.

The camera takes good color videos and photos and the night vision works well. The alarm sensitivity is adjustable and I left it set on medium. The camera is in my garage and with the garage door open it even goes off and sends photos when a car drives by in the street at 30 MPH at a distance of about 80 to 100 feet.

So far I have gotten  the camera and software to do everything that the manufacturer states that it will do. I like the camera but it is not perfect. I am not crazy about  the plastic construction of the case and mounting. I have used security cameras for 25 years and in my experience the plastic versions  do not hold up. Most cameras stop working due to the ingress of moisture or dust. I don't care if they are used inside or outside they have the same problem. The best cameras are sealed very tightly and filled with a clean inert gas to prevent contamination of the camera lens, infrared emitters and internal glass cover for the camera. This camera while it works well is cheaply made.  I also feel that the setup of the camera to get all of the features to work is difficult and not well documented. I am a highly technically skilled geek and can set it up but I suspect that many people will struggle with getting all of the features to work properly.

Whats in the box:
 The camera itself
 A mounting base
 A mounting screw
 An AC power supply with a USB 5 VDC output
 A power cord that is a USB connector on one end and a micro USB connector on the other.
 Two wall mounting screws and two plastic wall inserts for mounting the camera to drywall.
 A brief installation guide
 A small CD with the complete user manual on it, the software and instructions for the software and the IP camera finding software for your Windows PC or for your Apple PC.
 A contact card that allows you to call a technician and have them help you through the cameras installation.
 A QR code to allow you to download the app for the camera to your smart devices. I used and tested the one for the Apple iPhone.

Functionally the camera works fine but I wish it was built of metal and not plastic and hermetically sealed. I also wish that the instructions for the average user was simpler and easier to set up all of the features. I rated the camera at 3.5 stars but since there are no  stars my rating is a 4 star.

I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation. A review was not promised to the supplier in exchange for the sample but I stated that if I provided a review that it would be fair and honest.",1

"These mini bamboo spoons are amazing. They can be used by baby's, children, as well as adults. I myself like using them when I am eating my yogurt. I don't know what it is that makes it so different, but using these instead of regular spoons makes it so much better. They are lightweight, smooth, and pretty small. I also use them to feed my six month old niece. They work perfect for that as well. I have also used them in the morning for my coffee. They are perfect for adding sugar and stirring. I am really happy with this product. So far everything has been perfect and I have not one complaint.

I was provided a free sample of this product for test and review purposes.",1

"My daughter has recently gotten interested in the stars and outer space, so my husband and I thought that this set would be perfect for her. This Earth and stars kit is very nicely made. The Earth is very realistic and it is geographically accurate. The stars are very pretty. All of the items have a strong adhesive, so they adhere to the ceiling quite easily. This kit also comes with a genuine meteorite which is very interesting. The kit that I received did come with over 50 decorations in the box. We are very pleased with this product. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.",1
"Awesome, solid cups. I'm very impressed with these because the quality feels very strong in my hands. These will be perfect for my little ones who tend to drop things very often.

"For the price, the whiteboard is decent. It's nice and lightweight and seems to erase well. That being said, the unit that I received arrived dented in the top right corner.

"It is a little difficult to install if your backyard is surrounded by solid brick, but otherwise the solar light works very well.

Using the two screws that came with the light, I was able to mount the light on the side of my house above the yard gate (the house has wooden panels, which are considerably easier to drive screws into compared to the brick yard wall).

The only problem really arises from the fact that my house's orientation results in the solar light not really getting much sunlight - but the solar panels are efficient enough that the light somehow manages to have enough energy to light up without fail.

The solar light is angled downwards at an angle, perfect for illuminating walkways in your backyard or your porch. The way I have it isn't the best, because it lights up a narrow walkway near the yard gate. But I don't think other customers will have this issue (after all, brick yard enclosures aren't that common).

Overall, for $30, Aukey's solar light is a good investment that can make back yard barbecues and the like much more enjoyable and make your home feel more welcoming at night. It's lasted nearly two months now with no problems - but since I live in Southern California, the weather has generally been warm and agreeable - I'm not sure how the light will fare after the rain or during storms.

"If you are looking for a great wool sock, look no further ! really these CloudLine Merino Wool socks are amazing. I purchased the Country Back Blue and love them and the color.  I only wear socks that are over 50% wool, yes, even in the summer.  My go do sock have always been Smart Wool and Darn Tough brands but now I have a new go to  these CloudLine.  Yes, they are a bit pricey but so are the SmartWool and the Darn Tough.  You get what you pay for, and these are quality socks that will last.  Perfect fit, comfortable and wash up really nicely.  Not much more you can ask for in a great wool sock.  I also had a small issue with my order but their support team replied immediately and corrected the issue.

"I give Mr Shield Screen Protectors quality 5 stars, Mr Shield Customer Service 5 stars. This Particular screen protector is 1 star. Let me explain. I've bought Mr Shield before for my LG G4 and it fit perfect. This is too short on the sides. It doesn't cover the part of the screen that lights up completely. If you line up one side it's short on the other. Top to bottom it's perfect. I called customer service and they offered me a refund, I asked if they would send me the ""Anti Crash Screen protector"" for the HTC 10 as a replacement(Hoping it was cut differently). It was a perfect fit. I have reviewed that particular screen protector under its amazon link(5 stars).

"These stick on very well and cover even very large nipples. They even stuck back on to the wrapper nicely after using it! The very edges kind of starting peeling up a little bit, so I had to trim it carefully to get rid of the cover that didn't stick to my skin, but that was fine to do. I was very hesitant as I have large nipples  but it was so nice to feel comfortable without a bra! I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",1
"It is an easy and perfect fit.  If you need a see through option, this is the one to fit the bill.  I will say that I wish it had a little more grip to the cover.

I am not disappointed in anyway.  It is exactly what I needed and the value for the dollar is great.

This is my first time using a waist cincher and I am really impressed so far with this brand. It comes in a cram color and a black. I got the cream colored one so it won't show through certain clothes. I purchased the 3 XL one as I wasn't sure if the sizing was going to run smaller than said. It fits great. The fit is nice and song but still comfortable enough for a good extended wear. I don't feel any kind of discomfort while wearing especially with breathing. It has help restrict my eating as the tightness makes your body think you are full. It has three sets of eye hook closures so you can adjust as your body changes. I can't wait to see the results. I washed this on a delicate cycle and it held up good and didn't lose its shape. I also tumbled dry on low for about 10 minutes and then let it air dry. This is a great waist cincher/trainer. I am not disappointed and you won't be either. Purchased for a discount for a honest and unbiased review.,1
"Honestly, I am not one to purchase/wear a bracelet BUT lately I have been completely obsessed with anchors. After looking at the other anchor bracelet options advertised online, I gave in and purchased the navy blue Hallery Alloy DIY Twining Weave Gilded Anchors Rope Bracelet. I thought it would be perfect for the summer-- especially trips to the beach! I was a little hesitant about ordering this bracelet because I do not wear gold accessories. Happy to say that although I prefer wearing silver over gold, the design and colors go really good together. The anchors are the clasps which I thought was pretty neat.

Unfortunately, I really disliked that I was unable to wear it comfortably wrapped around 3 times. When wrapped around twice, its way too loose and so I find it quite pointless to use it as a bracelet at that point. I definitely advise those interested in purchasing to measure your wrists prior to ordering this bracelet. While it fit fine as a necklace, I did not like how it looked on me.

Pros:
-The bracelet is really cute and trendy
-Can be worn various ways (on hand, around neck, around ankle?)
-Lots of color options
-Very affordable (great gifts for teen birthday parties)

Cons:
-May not fit like shown in the pictures

"I have used many brushes and combs on my cat. He has a very thick undercoat and he is forever getting knots in his fur. This tool is the only thing that has ever worked and it works very well.

"This hammock is one of the best hammock I have ever slept in. It has Lots of room and it is long which is very good especially if your tall like me.

 It is very easy to set up just tie the ropes to two trees and your set up! The ropes seem durable so you shouldn't have to worry about them snapping off. The carbines are durable and simple as well and if you don't like them (I don't why anyone wouldn't) you can easily replace them .

 The Hammock itself is durable but yet very comfortable. It is made of rip stop material which means it takes a lot of effort in order for it to be ripped.  It is also very ""breathable"" Which I like because you can make the opening close per-say to keep most of the mosquitoes away without having to sacrifice fresh air by using your blanket to cover your face

The bag that you put it in is another plus. It is a compression bag so you can compress it down to fit in smaller spaces in your backpack which is very nice if your carrying a lot of other camping stuff. Compress it as if you were compressing a sleeping bag just pull the strap until its smaller. Not too small though never force anything beyond there capabilities.

I love love love this hose! I don't know why I waited so long to try one. I can't believe how light and easy it is to use. What more can I say.....I'm going to get another.,0
"What a gorgeous case! This is a dual-layer design with a rigid, smooth plastic edge that wraps around a softer plastic case. This makes the case extremely well-fitted, more so than many other smartphone cases in this price range (and believe me, Ive tried a lot of them).

The combination of smooth plastic around the perimeter and the slightly ridged texture across the back make this case a pleasure to hold, and the total absence of any injection molding burrs makes the whole thing feel very high quality.

The manufacturer claims that the case is military grade certified but its unclear exactly what that means. I think the smooth edge would probably get scuffed up if dropped on a hard surface, but it would keep phone itself from being scratched.

Like other reviews have noted, the buttons on the side do rattle very slightly when pressed. This might be an annoyance for some, but I honestly didn't notice it until I read the other reviews. I don't think it will bother me.

Overall, this is a beautifully-designed product, and holding it you really can tell that a lot of attention to detail went into its creation. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to others who are in the market for a great smartphone case.

I bought this wine glass for a friend and they absolutely loved it.. Its such a quality piece especially for the price.,0
"Helping our elderly next door neighbor in with his shopping bags, I saw he'd purchased no less than ten rat traps. Rats?? Where we live?? Without showing (hopefully) how freaked out I was at the thought of rats, I asked about the traps. He explained that they are actually common in our seaside locale and that he traps them with regularity in his homes crawlspace. OH (H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS) NO! I vented my new fear to DH and he humored me by buying and placing traps beneath our home. Shortly afterward, I jumped on an offer to receive a sample Tomcat Secure-Kill Rat Trap. It's very different from the wood and spring wire traps my spouse bought (the same kind the neighbor buys). The old style wood traps frankly scare me. They look like regular mouse traps except bigger. I've no doubt the wire could break fingers in the way if it snapped closed accidentally. I'm afraid of baiting or placing them, but the Tomcat traps are different. A Tomcat trap would still do major damage, but the chances of getting fingers in the way are much less. Tomcat traps are designed to be baited through a hole without fear of snapping off fingers. Also, instead of setting it and then placing it, like one does with the old style, the Tomcat can be placed and then set by pushing down a bar thats placed so there's no risk to fingers. As it turns out, we don't have rats, or we have smarter rats. Either way, we've caught none. I do know that if I was on my own, I'd only be using the Tomcat traps. There's the baiting, placing piece, but if a rat was caught, I'd want to have the Tomcat which lets one vacate the trap with more distance from the little creature within. I love the Tomcat's improved design thats safer and gives less chance of accidentally touching the rodent when releasing from the trap.",1

"These are very soft and comfortable. They are great for lounging around the house and cuddling up on a cold, rainy (or snowy) night! They keep my feet very warm and are super cozy, I only gave them three starts because of the lining. They are a knit sock on the outside, and have a soft liner on the inside, which is very nice; however, it is only attached at the top, so it doesn't always line up with the outer sock. This makes it so there is often an uncomfortable bulge until I get it straightened out. Not a huge deal, but causes a little more work than my comfy socks should have. Also upon washing, the lining separates further, making the matching up even more difficult. I like these and wear them happily, but do get frustrated by this.

"Excellent, and with NO complaints!",0
"About three years ago I purchased some sheets through Amazon that turned out to be the best quality, the softest and most comfortable sheets I have ever slept on in my life.  I recently noticed they are starting to wear out so when I got the opportunity to purchase these Empyrean Bed Sheets I thought I would give them a try.  Once I ordered them, they arrived within three days from when I placed the order, which was great!  I laundered them per the directions...machine washable on cold, in the dryer on low, which they dried very quickly.  I got them out of the dryer immediately and they were not wrinkled, the Chocolate Brown was still vibrant; not faded and they did not have any of the little fuzz balls some sheets have after laundering.  They did not shrink and retained their shape well.  The Empyrean Bedding company has over 40 years experience in the bedding industry and because of their expertise they have researched and developed bed sheet sets that are made from the highest quality, super soft brushed microfiber fabric and the best on the market.  This ""very cool"" (as in laying on or in between -- to the touch) microfiber is equivalent to the highest thread count of cotton sheets.  Compared to the sheets we currently have that I absolutely love, the microfiber fabric of the Empyrean sheets are a little heavier weight.  That being said, they are not in any way hot when laying under or between the sheets during these hot summer nights.  This microfiber is breathable and very durable, is hypoallergenic, contains antibacterial properties and is to be resistant to dust mites, as well.  The fitted sheet with the king size set I purchased has nice deep elasticized corner pockets and include a 1/2""W elastic strap at each corner to help keep the fitted sheet in place.  The topside head of the flat sheet has a three-line embroidery stitching, as do the pillow cases, which makes them look more luxurious and upscale much like you will find in many hotels.  These sheets are comfortable, cozy, super, super soft, are available in a variety of great colors and I will definitely purchase more Empyrean Bedding Sheet Sets.  They also come with a 100% Satisfaction Money Back Guarantee so if you do not agree that these are some of the very best, top quality sheet sets on the market and for an exceptionally reasonable price, you can get your money back.  I might add they arrived in a soft plastic bag that zips around and open on three sides and I use these plastic bags to store other sheet sets in when not in use and it helps keep them neatly organized in the linen closet.  Additionally, Empyrean Bedding Company provided a nice little 24 page booklet called, ""Better Sleep Guide"" that provides a variety of great information.  Just to give you a very brief overview, the headings are::  Sleep 101, Bedding 101 and Decor 101.

Headset is well protected in plastic shell shaped to its form.

The wire is about 60 inches long and the width between the ear pads is about 6 inches.

Its a wired headset with built-in microphone and the volume can be controlled by an in-line switch.  Its over the ear design and very comfortable to wear.  It can be folded but I wish there is a carrying pouch comes with it.

I haven't wear an over the ear headset for a long time and almost forgot what it feels like.  The sound quality of this headset is fairly good, and with this over the ear headset I no longer need to hear my breathing noise from wearing some in-ear headset.  Its very comfortable to wear and the length of the wire is not short and just right.

"This Premium Heavy Duty Silicone Wedding Band is a great idea!  The design is NICE looking, not tacky, & it fits well.  I like that hubby can wear the ring when working with tools & not damage the ring or hurt his hand.

I received a discount on this product for the purpose of my honest review.

Don't worry, I have integrity & do NOT lie in my reviews whether I paid full price or received a discount!

I USED TO think that people who received discounts on reviewed products were all dishonest just trying to get freebies or cheap products for writing fluff-filled reviews whether they actually liked the product or not, but I have since found out how things work and I mostly disagree with that now. I can't say that some people don't do that, but I can say that my experience has been a good one & the way I find products is I look for things I NEED & WANT, so I almost always have knowledge about them before ordering something. If it is the first time I've used a certain product I disclose that also in my review. That knowledge gives me some advantage in writing my reviews because I know what to look for in a product, how it may compare to others, etc. & then I can write a fair, honest, & hopefully helpful review!

I know that Amazon reviews are helpful & so many people look at them to decide if they should purchase a product. I also know seeing so many reviews from certain products that seem like they are all from discounts or freebies can be deeply discouraging. Take heart & know that my experience has been that many of the reviewers genuinely want to give you a fair & honest review. Again, there are some who use a product once or twice & then write a glowing review, but I'm not talking about them. I'm talking about those who take the time to THOROUGHLY test a product before writing a review. They don't write reviews after 3 days of receiving a product just because someone may want them to pound out a bunch of reviews in 72 hours.

Feel free to ask me any questions. I will do my best to follow up if you do.

"I have been using the 25W version of this heater in my 5 gallon for well over a year now and it has held up great.

This heater has maintained a steady heat output the whole time. If the temperature of the room goes up, the water temp will go up too, as this thing doesn't have a thermostat. I have a thermometer in the tank as well, and tweak the heater to get it to the ideal temp. In the summer when it is warm I have to lower it a bit (this is to be expected).

I have an aquarium where the filter area is separated from the main body of the aquarium, and if the level goes to low, the filter area becomes emptied out. I have the heater in there, and on a few occasions this happened, and so the heater was on and not submerged, and it didn't ruin it. It has also been fully submerged past the dial with no harm.",0
"There are other great technical reviews here, so I am going to approach this in more simple terms. I've been a ham for 41 years. I work in the commercial LMR business selling top quality radios for business and public safety applications. Starting with opening the box and looking at the radio. I have a few other low priced imported radios, I will say this one right from the start impressed me as being a better radio. The feel of the radio is much more ergonomic than some of the other imported radios I have. The radio feels good in your hands, not too heavy and easier to read the markings and labels on the radio than most.
The radio comes with most of the accessories you might want. It has a drop in charger with a 115v AC cord as well as a 12v cigarette lighter coiled cord. The coil is nice for keeping the cord organized in a mobile environment. There is also a belt clip that is spring loaded and has a metal base. The clip is held to the radio with 2 screws. The big feature with this radio is that it comes with 2 antennas. They are both designated as dual band antennas. The short one is about 6.5"" long and the instruction manual says this is for short distance communications. The other antenna is 14"" long and very slim and flexible. So it is not jabbing at you if you have the radio on your belt. My testing between the 2 radios did show better performance from the longer antenna as expected. I would like to put these on an analyzer and see what they look like. I don't have the right connectors right now and will amend this review if I am able to test them.

I hate instruction manuals, so I decided to see if I could figure out the radio without it first. I was able to get the basic functions of the radio working by trial and error. It seemed a little easier than some of the other menu driven radios I've played with. My next step was to try out the included software and programming cable. Again, with my other radios, I had to pay extra for a cable. I popped the CD in to take a look at what's on it. It seems to be all prolific USB to serial drivers that are on the CD. I already had these installed and working on my computer, so I didn't try anything from the CD. It's been my experience that if you need programming SW for these radios, the seller I got the radio from usually has it on the website. So I went to Radioddity.com and easily located the programming software for this radio. The download and installation on my Windows XP shop PC went quick and flawlessly. The software is pretty simple and straight forward. The channels are laid out in a spreadsheet and I was able to figure out how to set everything up just by looking at it. I loaded in the data for 7 repeaters in the area and downloaded to the radio. At this point I needed to open the manual to learn the correct way to get it into memory mode. In a few seconds I was on the air. I put out a call on our local VHF repeater and had a couple guys I knew come back to give me an audio report. They both told be I was into the repeater 100% and the audio quality was exceptionally good. I also noticed that my receive audio quality was really good. Loud and crisp. I had set all the channels to xmit at high power. This is 10 watts. I had about a 15 min QSO on the repeater and the battery was starting to get warm, at the end of the QSO the battery was very warm. I could still hold the radio, but any warmer would have become uncomfortable. This is where I found my first negative about the radio. There are only 2 power settings available. 5 or 10 watts. I would prefer at least another setting of 1 or 2 watts mainly for battery conservation. Output power in most situations really doesnt make a whole lot of difference with any radio. So I would suggest making the 5 watt setting the default and switching to hi power if communications become marginal. If you aren't making it on 5, 10 is not going to make a huge difference in most cases. The biggest factor in radio coverage is the antenna, so putting the longer antenna on will be much more effective than boosting the output power. Normally you would pay $15-$25 for an additional, longer antenna. I really like that it is included with this radio. With the help of the manual, I was able to field program most of the functions and memories in the radio. I sure wouldnt want to have to do this all the time. the software makes it very easy. And the cable and the software are included in the price of the radio.
I did a little out of band listening and the sensitivity seemed as good if not better than my Kenwood and Yaesu radios. There is also a built in FM broadcast receiver. I was really impressed with this feature. I have this on other radios, but the audio quality makes it worthless. This radio has a really good FM receiver. I could tune stations that I can not hear on my car stereo and the sound quality was worth listening to. I did not test the cross-band repeat function. There is a supplemental instruction sheet on how to use this function. I will test it in the near future and add the results to this review. The only feature it might be lacking is an instant WX feature. I have that on some other radios and like it. you can always program the weather channels into the memory and get the same results.
Overall, I really like this radio. We don't have a lot of VHF/UHF activity in this area anymore, so I tend to stay on the HF bands. I was concerned that the audio quality would be poor, but that is not the case. The reports were great. The receive audio is definitely better than any amateur portable I own and it rivals many of the commercial radios I deal with. As with all the portable radios on the market, all the added features add a learning curve to operating the radio. But I was able to do everything I wanted to do with little reading. When comparing the lower priced portables on the market, I think this would be a great purchase. It is well worth the additional price compared to the $30-$40 radios. I guess the 10 watt output adds to the price a bit. I'm not impressed with power. But the performance and added accessories make the added cost well worth it. I doubt I will use any of my other dual band radios again. This is a good, solid, quality radio at a great price.
The distributor has provided me with this product free of charge or discounted price for review and feedback based on my first-hand usage of the product.

"I prefer the leather band to the stock fitbit band. The leather is very soft and comfortable, I wear mine all day and night. This pin system for switching bands on the fitbit blaze, while simple, can be a pain. I will say one negative thing about the bands is that the pins slide around a lot, and make switching these in more annoying than usual. I would like to switch bands for the office and for working out, so I'm thinking it would be easier to buy an extra frame and just move the blaze.",0

"These folders are awesome! I have two little boys who absolutely destroy their school supplies. I always have to replace their paper folders several times a year bc of wear and tear. Also, they often leave half open water bottles in their bags, which trickle out and ruin their homework folder. The plastic is durable and really helps to keep water and grime off of their work. Definitely recommend!

"I really like this type of stylus vs. the ones with the rubber tip. I have a few tablets that I use styluses on because I hate fingerprints on my screens. This stylus has a tip covered with a micro knit fiber that makes the stylus feel less ""Squishy"". I also really like the longer length of this stylus because it feel more like a pencil or pen. I have also found that this stylus is very touch sensitive, and the screen responds immediately. With this stylus, I don't have to touch the screen multiple times or harder to get a response. With this set, you also get two extra tips to extend the life of the stylus.

I received the stylus at a discount or for free for my honest and unbiased evaluation and review. I make it a point to submit honest review for any and all products as I depend on honest customer reviews for my purchases.",1

"I usually wear a medium/large and used the size chart and ordered the XL. The XL fits great. If you use the size chart to find your size in this brand you should not have many problems with the fit.
This garmet was easier to put on than expected and hugs in all the right places. I have had two C-sections and this body shaper works wonders at flattening out my tummy. I love how easy the hooks at the bottom are to use and the fact that you can still wear your favorite bra with this shaper. I also like removable strap option.

"After using this product, I have absolutely no complaints.  They wheels look stylish and have an extremely smooth action.  The build appears substantial and thus far, I have no concerns with their longevity.

To this point, I have only used the casters on hard surfaces, such as hardwood and tile, since I do not have any carpet in my home.  As a result, I cannot comment on the function of this product on carpet floors.

Also, be aware that there are no locks on any of the casters.  I did not need locks, since I purchased them to use on a chair.  However, if anyone is planning on using the casters for carts or tool boxes, the lack of a locking mechanism may be a deterrent.

Overall, I am pleased with the purchase and it provided smoother movement, in comparison to the old casters that had limited movement, due to dust accumulation.  Over time, I will attempt to update my review if the wheels have unsatisfactory longevity or function.

"Our dog won't eat this unless we hide it in some food. The package does warn of this possibility, due to the odor of the turmeric. No problem.  I was excited to find an organic option when our vet recommended glucosamine for our pup...hope this will compare to Dasuquin, which is the specific brand they recommended.  I am wary of brands that vets recommend, since they also recommend Science Diet and such garbage foods.  This looks like a great supplement, and no stomach upset so far.  The price is very reasonable, and I like that it is made in the USA.  I did receive a free bottle in return for writing this review.  I think this is truly a good option!",1

You can also toggle between Meters and Yards. So this is more than a range finder.

USES?
>>This small unit is ideal for determining distances to targets.
>>Can be used for amateur/non-professional surveying
>>Can be used to determine heights of buildings, trees, and other structures

Note that there are two buttons on the top of the range finder, and they do different things. One powers the unit up and sets your cross-hairs in the lens. The other button allows you to move through the different capabilities -- so you'll get the hang of how the two buttons work together. It's very easy to find your targets, get your values (distance, height, speed, etc.)

This is a pretty cool little unit. At times I find myself wishing the markings inside the unit were luminescent orange or red instead of black, but that is really the only problem I have with this range finder. It's easy to use and only tends to glitch with leafy targets and other things that don't perfectly reflect the beam of the unit.

I received this item for free given the understanding that I would test it out and post my honest, unbiased opinions about the product.",1
"This bag is great, I am very pleased with the quality of the material. It reminds me of a vynal pool lining, very heavy and the seams are super reinforced. I also like the back pack type straps they put on it too, I am so happy that this thing came in because I will put it to the test.

Although I received this product at a discount for my honest review, it is safe to say I would have paid full price for this.",1

"This sleeping bag was purchased to be used mainly for summer backpacking trips due to it's lightness and compression-ability. The sleeping bag is rated to around 50 degrees Fahrenheit. I have tried it out a little in my house. I was laying in front of a fan on a hardwood floor. My thought is that you would definitely want a sleeping pad under this. The sleeping bag is not very thick. I could feel the coolness of the floor through the bottom of the sleeping bag. I felt comfortable temperature wise in the sleeping bag in front of the fan, which was in front of an air conditioner vent. The zipper moved very smoothly and did not get stuck on the fabric.
The length of the sleeping bag was surprising in a positive way. I am around 5 ft. 10 inches. There was still plenty of room at the bottom of the sleeping bag. I probably could have gotten my head inside of the sleeping bag without any problem. As far as the width goes, if I was much heavier/ rounder, I'm not sure that I would be comfortable in the sleeping bag. With my arms in the sleeping bag it was cozy.
Packing the sleeping bag back up was pretty standard for any stuff sack that I have used. Starting with the bottom of the sleeping bag I was able to get it shoved back into the stuff sack. Once in I tried tightening up on the straps on the sack, I was able to get it down to about the size of a football.

"This is a review of the GDEALER 20/30 LED White Globe Solar lights.  I received these lights with quick shipment from the supplier.  The lights come packaged well in a generic recyclable box with a stake/stand and a 4-page easy to read/understand manual.  The solar cell/battery compartment is approximate 2 1/2 in square and has simple weather resistant push button controls--one for the power and the other for the mode (flash on/off) for the lights.  The length of the cord from the solar cell unit to the first LED bulb is about six feet in length.  I mounted these on the inside ceiling of a gazebo on my deck with the solar cell on the outside of the roof.  I have left the unit on (it has a photovoltaic sensor for light) so it charges during the day and at dusk the lights come on a stay on throughout the night. No problems after a week of use.  Although this set of lights is only about 14 ft in length (20 ft total from the solar cell) it provides enough ambient lighting under my gazebo roof to sit outside and visit with friends and enjoy the cool summer evenings without having to worry about running electrical extension cords for lighting.
  I've tried the 'flashing' mode on this unit and it works well.  If you are having a party, this would add some excitement to your atmosphere.
GDEALER also has a 50/60 (series 2) and a 100 LED unit (series 3) and a 200 LED unit (series 4) models from their brochure/manual.  The 100 and 200 units have a 7-mode switch for light mood control.  I did not receive these longer units for my review, so I cannot comment on these features.
 I did, however, receive this 20/30 globe unit free from the dealer.  My review is unbiased.  I would recommend this unit based on my experience of this unit.",1

"I suffer from tendonitis in the elbow. It can be so painful at night that it wakes me from sleep. When I have a flare up, which is quite often, my hand goes numb mixed with pins and needles.  Then the pain hits the elbow on both upper and lower side of the joint. No more sleep or work until I get it under control. I finally figured out that while sleeping, my elbow gets cold and that causes a flare up.
Enter compression wear! I have notice how compression wear can help warm you up when at rest and help keep you cool when you work out. These are black in color, so they go with anything you might wear. I ordered a large and it fits well. I am rather beefy. They are a blend of 88% copper nylon and 12% spandex according to the screen-printed label inside the sleeve. There is one flat seam running the length of the sleeve, so it shouldnt irritate your skin. The top cuff is made from elastic and the bottom cuff is a stitched seam.
These sleeves have helped me get a better nights sleep for the last 5 nights. That is deemed a success in my book. If you suffer from pain in your elbow, give these a try. They might surprise you. Nice color, good fit, resonably priced, and small enough to carry in your pocket. They were a good choice.

I received this product at a discount for an honest review, which I have just given.",1
"I'm a very busy person and I don't often post reviews but this time I'll make an exception. When I first read all the positive reviews about this product I was skeptical, too many highly positive reviews can indicate something fishy. I also am skeptical about reviews in which a product was received for free or for a reduced cost. However this product is the real deal. It simply works, and it works well. I say this as a person who paid full price for the product and has absolutely no interests other than providing an unbiased, actual experience review.

I recently replaced my shower control valve as part of a full bathroom remodel. Unknown to me at the time it contained a water flow restrictor. When the remodel was complete I was very upset to find that the water volume for the shower was now so low it was difficult to get clean. It was impractical at this point to replace the new shower control valve, so the only option was to try to find a shower head that worked well with a lower water volume. I first purchased an expensive shower head from Delta that got good reviews. It barely worked at all with a lower water volume. Then I tried another shower head from Moen. Same result. I was ready to give up when I decided to give the Aqua Elegante a chance. The Aqua Elegante has a removable water restrictor. The last thing you want is two water restrictors in the water line, one in the control valve and another in the shower head. Additionally, the Aqua Elegante was properly designed to deal with lower water volumes, unlike the two name brands I mentioned. I was shocked and delighted to discover that this shower head worked incredibly well with the low volume of water and gives a wonderful shower experience. I can only imagine how great it must work with unrestricted shower control valves. It also appears to be made as well as the Delta or Moen at much less cost, and the owner of the company cares enough about his customers to reach out personally to them after the purchase to ensure that they are satisfied. What more can you ask for?

If you're looking for a well made, low cost shower head that works superbly with low water volumes, look no further.",1

"These glasses arrived just in time for Independence Day! ! These sunglasses fit well on the average size head. I am a bigger guy and they felt a little short on the ears.  They still stay on with no problems. The red, white and blue are bright. A great way to show your USA spirit. The lenses darken the sun really well so no more squinting!

It is a little small on me but I have a very very large head.  Most hats never fit me, I have to get really big hats for me to wear.

But with that said, I couldn't go down on stars for being slightly small on my gigantic head.  Because this is very comfortable and breaths very well.

I would highly recommend this hat for others to buy.

"I'm pleasantly surprised with how solid these feel.  They are just hard plastic, but they seem to have the same strength as the hard plastic normally used for clips and such in backpacks.  No cracks or breaks or anything so far.  They work for us - for our stroller they help with what we can attach to the stroller.  They fit well on my backpack straps - easy enough to attach, but they attach pretty solidly so I'm not concerned that they'll come off unexpectedly.

Pros: they work well, the fit well on my backpack (and some straps on our strollers) the ones with the cords offer good versatility

Cons: none that I can think of

If I could change anything about this product: nothing

Packaging type: bulk packaging - these just come in a plain bag, nothing exciting there

Very poorly made. The back was not even connected to the sides. Had to super glue it together as soon as I bought it. Then it still did not fit tightly around the top.,0
I think this product is a good product except for the fact that they are simply too big. I ordered a size D and they are very loose on me even though my thigh measurement lies in the middle of the measurement requirements. I did wear them a few times and they were effective but I am disappointed in the size discrepancy. Consider ordering a size smaller than you feel is necessary.,0
"Being physically disabled I like to use music as a distraction when doing most things to keep my mind off the pain. I love that I can stick this in the shower, carry it into the kitchen while cooking, and stick it on any number of things while doing every day adulting.

I absolutely love this little speaker! I am a tech nerd and few things make me rage worse than poor quality. This speaker is about the size of my palm but is amazingly loud. Having the volumes maxed on both my phone and the speaker I can understand the words to the songs being played on this speaker in the 2nd story shower (with closed bathroom door) while standing anywhere on the first story of my house. I don't live in a mansion by any means but just think: If it can be clearly heard anywhere in the house just imagine how well it works while you're in the same room with it.

Enough about the sound quality. I'll tell you the rest of what you need to know.
This little thing weighs less than 2 ounces. It does come with a short charging cable and a strangely translated instruction book in the bottom of the box. Make sure to open the bottom of the box the speaker comes in. (see product image 7). When charging there will be a red light near the power button. When charging is complete the light goes out. It can be used while charging. When it is powered on there is a blue light and a ""ding dong"". There is another single ""ding"" when it pairs with your device. The suction cup is very strong. It would not release when I pressed it to my kitchen table. I nearly picked up the corner of my table with it before prying it off. I didn't want to chance ripping the nub off the back of the cup. The waterproof flap for the charging port may take a little bit of messing with to make sure it is properly sealed. Just to play it safe I hang mine charging port down while showering. The mic is pretty clear. My wife and I could understand each other well with shower off. With shower on it was really noisy on both ends. Product description claims 33 ft bluetooth range from source. I believe this is accurate. I haven't tested battery life past 1 hour. The volume did take some getting used to. A quick press of the - or + restarts or skips the song playing. HOLDING - or + changes the volume. I wish there were different buttons for volume and skip but I'll survive. Pressing the telephone button will answer or hang up a call. HOLDING the telephone button will redial your last call. It is nice to have this option but it has potential to go wrong. I accidentally hit redial at 10pm. I don't think any of these things warrant removing any stars. Just watch what you press.

SUMMARY: Love it so much. Great sound. Waterproof charging port plug may appear sealed when not. Highly recommend.

"This blouse fits pretty good. I love the material as it is very soft and comfortable to wear. My recommendation is to wear a spaghetti strap shirt under with this blouse if you want to wear it backwards. You can actually use a different color as I did in the pictures if you want to add some flavor but overall it is still very cute. I am about 5'7 130 pounds and I usually wear a size small or extra small in shirts. I wish this came in an extra small but because it is a little bit big but I wouldn't say it fits big it's probably just my body shape because most shirts that are made this way will fit a little roomy so you have comfort. I would highly recommend this blouse. Great quality and comfortable.

"I do a lot of active things outdoors, and being in Texas, that means the heat is unbearable most of the time during the summer months. I knew I needed to get something other than an insulated water bottle, especially for longer lasting out door activities. This has been proven to be just what I need!

It's 2L, which lasts a long time. I went kayaking for 3 hours the other weekend and had plenty of water the entire time. Because I didn't mind the backpack getting wet (as it already was from kayaking) I placed ice in the backpack to keep it cold, which worked perfectly. The pack also has other compartments, great for storing keys and any other items you may have with you. The straps are almost mesh like, which is great when wearing as it feels very breathable and comfortable. Aesthetically, it looks very nice and well made. The adjustable straps and zippers all work well.

The backpack came quickly and on time. It was well packaged to avoid any damage to the product during the shipment process.

I received this product at discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, and I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and received no incentives or rewards for doing so. I would definitely recommend this backpack to anyone looking for an alternative to having to carry around water bottles while doing outdoor activities. I plan to use mine for kayaking, hiking, and music festivals. I hope my review was helpful to any readers.",1
"I have the green iPhone 5c and I have accumulated about 30 assorted cases. Some I liked for style and others for major protection, because I am super klutzy and do not want to have to replace my phone for a while. I found that the super protective cases made the phone heavy and it didn't exactly slide into a small purse. I got rid of the old screen protectors that were just sheets of plastic that just did nothing but grow air pockets all over and in their place I am using the tempered glass that I think probably protects a little. The cases I do not understand are the thin hard plastic cases. To me they are just a broken phone waiting to happen....zero cushioning and zero protection. Some of the super protective cases would go on, but I was afraid to take them off because it would break my phone just getting them off. Like I said I have this big drawer full of cases!!! The other problem is that there seems to be some kind of difference between the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5S and the iPhone 5c and some sellers don't differentiate between the first two and the 5c. When offered the opportunity to review this case that stated clearly that it was for the iPhone 5c, I got it. The one I have is pink and aqua. It is not made from hard plastic, but a very firm rubber, that has a bit of a cushiony ""give"" if it were to be dropped (and no, I haven't dropped it........yet). But it is not bulky and snaps right onto my phone. I can just slide in and out of my purse without it catching on everything because it is too big and bulky. There is a small lip that goes around the front like a frame so if you put your phone down face first it should not get scratched. The back is kind of a shadowy pink that you can see the Apple logo through and the outside frame is the aqua. If almost completely covers the green color of my phone except in the small area near the camera. Of course most people would just slap on the case and hope for the best, but I am not really average. I really like the case, but I wish it was just a teeny tiny little more cushion completely around the edge. Not a lot because I like the sleekness, but just a tad, which is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five stars. Normal people would probably not give it a second thought, but I am not that normal. This case would be great for almost everyone and I feel that it gives a great deal more protection than those ridiculous thin, hard plastic cases and it fits the iPhone 5c perfectly.

I received this case either for free or at a reduced cost in exchange for my fair and honest review. All opinions are mine and mine alone. Like you, I am an avid Amazon shopper and I rely on truthful reviews when making purchases for myself and my family.",1

"Well made bag that can fit a lot of different things because of all the different pockets. I really like the look of it too, and it is really comfortable to wear. Laptops fit perfectly in the bag, and there is plenty of room for any accessories you might want to keep with your laptop. It looks like a military bag, and that's probably because it is made by an ammo company. The strap is adjustable making it easy for anybody to use. It is really lightweight and comfortable on the shoulders, but still is really well built from high quality materials. I have gotten several comments on how nice the bag looks, and several people have asked me where they can get one too. Great bag for carrying a laptop and all the accessories.

"I am a radiology tech and on my feet most of the time, the shoes did take a break-in time but have great support. Super cute shoe and the only complaint I have is that they are very noisy . I'm not sure how to fix this but they squeak and make sounds like passing gas when walking around that is why I am giving it a low rating. Fix that, and I would buy another pair or two!",0

"I love how slimming this swimsuit is. It smooths out my hips and midsection giving me a nice hourglass shape. It holds me in all the right places. The material is good quality, nice and silky soft. It is well made and the stitching is sturdy. There is a fine mesh lining in the front with a built in bra and removable pads. The built in bra gives my breasts good support but the pads are too small for me so I have to take them out. I got the aqua colored one and the color is so flattering even on my pale skin tone. This is a great modest full coverage suit for me to get to the beach this summer.

It comes in a glass ball with some small white rocks, a tiny stick and a ball shaped plant inside all in water.  When the water needs to be changed the plant turns a dark brown/grey color but as soon as the water is changed the plant returns to a bright green pretty much instantly.  The chain that the pendant is on is a good length, it is plenty long for you to be able to take it on and off without having to unlatch it. The chain is nice and sturdy and even when you pull on it it doesn't break.

The water needs to be changed in this pendant every couple of weeks or so.  To do this is very easy, you just unscrew the top of the pendant where it attaches to the chain, insert a dropper into the hole to take the water out, then replace the water using the dropper. It would be nice if this pendant came with a dropper because the hole is quite small and even though I had droppers in several different sizes on hand I did not have one that was small enough to fit inside of the hole.  It wasn't an issue because I was able to take the water out using the larger dropper by holding the pendant upside down but it would have been more convenient if I had a smaller dropper that fit inside the hole.  Overall I think that this is a really cool necklace.  It looks nice and I've gotten a lot of comments and compliments on it when I wear it.  Everyone thinks it's neat and wants to know where I got it from!

Full disclosure: I received this necklace at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. However that in no way influenced my opinion or review of it.",1

"This is not only nice looking but a very practical dual grinder.  We have pink salt and colored peppercorns - which seem to be a little softer than all black peppercorns.  The mechanism works really well and both chambers are so easy to fill and adjust.  Having both salt and pepper in one device is very handy at the table and I have to say, it looks good.  The grinding is easy and uniform.  I don't have to crank forever to get the amount I want.  I guess my only issue is the caps.  We use the grinder at least once a day everyday and after a few weeks, the caps are not very tight anymore.  Other than that, the grinder works great, and looks awesome.

"I purchased the Roybens Women Swimsuit Retro One Piece Swimsuit in size US 6-8 and in the Floral option. I am very impressed with this one piece swimming suit. The quality is outstanding. The suit has a lining so the material is very durable. It would take quite a bit to snag through the material. The construction is fantastic too, The quality really is very nice. I like the print, the colors are all very bold and really pop. I'm not sure if the fit was great for me. I think I probably should have bought a size smaller, but I'm afraid I may be in-between the small and medium. I have an average bust size for my frame, but my butt is a little bigger than average for my frame. When I but two pieces I usually mix and match sizes to compensate and it works well. I don't blame the suit, it's magnificent. It's still pretty comfortable even though it's a little loose. I love that the chest part is a a little padded, but not uncomfortably so. I did take one star off because I feel like the straps to tie around the neck could be a little longer. All in all I like this suit quite a bit and would feel very confident giving it as a gift or recommending it to friends and family members.

"Great when it was working.. the reason for the 1 star is that item was purchased in July (2016), yet in 3 short months it's already non functional - Motor is no longer running.

"First of all, the smell of the cincher is PUTRID!!! I have never smelt anything like it in my life! I tried spraying it with Febreeze to try to get rid of some of the stench. Luckily after the first 2 days  the smell went away. I purchased the 5XL according to the size chart but OMG  it was basically an upper body workout trying to clip it on. Like every other hookor so, it would unclip, and then I would have to start over about 3 or 4 times to get it just right.
  After I finally got the cincher on, it was extremely tight and uncomfortable to breathe in. However, I've heard from other girls who waist train that it's best to sleep with the cincher on so it can get used to your body. After doing that for 2 nights straight, the cincher has been a lot more comfortable to deal with. My only issue with the waist cincher is that it rides up when I sitting down. I'm not sure if that means if I have bought the wrong size or if I need to pull it down closer to my hips, but I'll keep wearing it and see what happens.

"These socks are definitely knee length, are comfortable to wear and are made with a thick, durable material. The last pair of knee length socks that I purchased seemed a bit thin, but these are extra thick in comparison.

These are really great for all kinds of sports including martial arts. My husband likes to wear the black pair while he is practicing jujitsu. Despite the thickness of them we haven't really noticed that they cause a lot of sweating, and my feet definitely don't overheat while wearing these. The fabric is very breathable. The heel and toe parts of these socks feel comfortable and offer great support. The stripes add a nice touch to the socks and the neutral colors allow them to go well with practically anything. I've already put both pair of socks through a cycle in my washer and dryer and they came out in the same condition that they arrived in. They seem to be well made and I'm positive they will last us a while. Overall we are pleased with these socks and we would recommend them to family and friends.

"I usually don't give good reviews about Amazon Mosquito products, so this is a rare exception because this stuff actually really works! And if you plan on buying the mosquito bracelets, don't waste your money on the plastic bands. However, the micro fiber bands do work, but not as good as Gardencense spay. I live in South Louisiana and I am outside a lot gardening so I wear mosquito repellent 6 to 9 months out of the year. I was really reluctant to buy this product with so many bad past experiences while trying to find a repellent with no DEET. My husband and I have used this spray for one week now and we can honestly say that not one mosquito even dared to buzz by us on our nightly walk to the river. There is a citrusy smell, but it is not overbearing and I do not feel like I just sprayed down with Lemon Pledge like some sprays I have purchased on Amazon. If you are concerned with Sulfates, Parabens and Deet, then this spray is worth the money. I will buy again.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1
"Worked very well.  Biggest problem was figuring out where to set on t-shirt both front name and back photo.  The most difficult problem to figure out that it automatically reversed photo with words when you asked it to be printed. Spent a long time trying to find a way to do the reverse.  When I printed one for a sample, is when I found out it did it automatically.  Would have been nice to have said that in the instructions.",1
"I know that ordering clothing online is can be tricky when it comes to the proper size. I am no exception as I am taller, with longer arms but skinny. I got my measurement again before ordering and used their sizing chart. I erred on the side of caution and went up to a Large instead of a Medium, which is what I normally wear. Well, in the shoulders and arms, even length it fits perfect. There is some extra room in the chest and back which is because I am skinny and because most people probably like a little more ""breathing"" room. I said it ""Fit as expected"" because I did order the Large and that is one size bigger than I normally get. But if I had ordered the medium it may have been to short it the arms.

Sooo....enough about the size. The garment arrived in perfect condition with all buttons and stitching in place as it should be. As for the color, my computer showed the red to be a little more subdued than what I was shocked to see. The red is a BRIGHT red, very bold and pops out at you. Not orange but just pure red. If you want to be seen, this is the color. The fabric (98% cotton) is soft to the touch but feels thick and durable, like it will last a long time. I am happy with the shirt overall and think anyone else should check their measurements and order the way that you normally would unless you are right on the edge to the next size up or down.

"My husband has been wanting a silicone band to wear when he was doing yard work, fixing our vehicles, etc, so he can keep his gold band in better condition. It serves its purpose well. He said if you wear it all day it gets rather sweaty, as it is skin tight, but wearing just for working on particular jobs its fine.

My husband's only complaint is how tight it is. He has small fingers and large knuckles, so it can be a bit of a challenge to get on and off (being skin tight). He would prefer that the band not be as thick as it is, but it is a standard width for a man's ring.

It serves its purpose well, and I'm very glad we got this for him! Now he can still show we are committed to each other without risking the ""real"" wedding band!

"I have an extra long yoga mat (26x71in.) and it's pretty heavy compared to average yoga mats. I purchased this because I hate when it gets loose as I'm carrying it and I have to spread it out and roll it back up again. Just an OCD thing of mine that drives me nuts if it's not perfectly rolled up. Having this strap makes things easier, especially since I'm also carrying my foam block as well. The strap is made of quality material and it slips around either end of my mat perfectly while the D rings keep it nice and taut. It's nice to be able to have my mat hanged up as well when I'm not using it. Nice simple little thing that makes life easier.

"I had open RNY gastric bypass surgery and lost over 210lbs. I deal with a lot of abdominal issues like excess skin, slow digestion, bad posture, risk of hernia. Over the years I had worn my medical band religiously and was gifted with a beautifully small hourglass waist (though I am more pear shaped because of my skin not that it even matters).  Im 10 years out now and all my bands are worn and tattered. I have tried other waist wear, but have not found anything that didn't telescope over itself or start to bend. Anything with those darn ribs would just end up poking you horribly as time goes on or bends out of shape. The NEW!! Maxine Women's Slim Latex Waist Cincher Top Quality Waist Trainer Shaper is made with strong materials that both hold you in and don't ride up.
At first I ordered an XL, but when it arrived, I realized that would not fit at all. After looking at the product page again, I saw that I was a different sizing chart in the pictures. Based on this chart, I am a 2XL. My measurements are 39, 31, 42. I ended up ordering the 3XL just to be safe. The seller was great about the return and the next one came fast. It took forever to get on, but once I got it, I thought it fit and felt great! I could bend and do actual things with out it moving much. I feel secure (my surgery was done open, so all my abdominal muscles were cut) and my posture is getting better. I don't think I could wear it for more than a few hours though. I did that with my other shapers as well; on for a while off for a bit. Oh and it didn't telescope!!! Oh, did I mention it makes a pretty sweet boudoir prop? Pictures coming soon I hope. *I received this product for free or a discounted price for my unbiased review. I take reviews very seriously and rely on them when I purchase products.

"This is an incredible value for the price.  You are getting an 1080P HD camera and a TON of accessories. It includes a waterproof case and tons of different mounts so you can pretty much attach it to whatever you want.  The only thing you will need is a micro sd card. They recommend at least 8GB.

The instruction book is pretty basic but it is adequate to use the camera.  It explains what all the accessories are and how to use them according to what you want to do.  The camera is small and light and actually pretty easy to use.  The battery lasts for 90 minutes of recording which is pretty decent.  It also has a mini hdmi port.

The video this camera takes is full hd and looks very crisp and clear...even in fast moving ""action"" shots. It is also able to take still photos which is really nice, especially in the water where you would not dare take a cell phone. It even has a zoom function. The sound is also pretty good even in the waterproof case.  I cannot wait to take this to the beach!  For the price this is an awesome camera that comes with almost everything.  If your looking for an HD action cam and don't want to spend a fortune I would highly recommend this.  I received this camera for free in exchange for an honest review, all opinions are my own.",1

"I have been looking for a pair of wireless headphones for my daughter to take to college with her. She really wanted a pair of Beats, but I am not paying the price for those. I looked a lot of different ones on here but nothing really stood out to me. Then I came across these. They seemed to have decent reviews and had the look I was going for. So I decided to purchase them.

My initial thought when I opened the package was, hmm, these look nice. I tried them and the ear piece's were extremely soft and supple. I threw them back in the box and gave them to my daughter. She had the same reaction as me. She loved they way they felt. I thought, OK, they look and feel great but how do they function. She followed the instructions to hold the power button down for 8 seconds to place it in pairing mode. She turned on Bluetooth on her iPhone and searched. It instantly found the headphones and connected, giving her an audible indication that it was connected to her phone. So far so good. She loaded up Spotify on her phone and ,WOW, the sound was incredible. Really nice deep bass tones and just the right amount of highs and mids to fill out the sound.

I cannot attest to the longevity of the battery just yet. The box indicates 25 hours of battery time. However, you do have the option of plugging in a regular 3.5mm cable into the headphones and the phone to use it as a wired headphone. I like that it also has a Microphone on it so you can answer calls. The only negative so far is that the sound does bleed from the headphones at higher volumes so people can hear what you a listening to.

All in all, I am pretty happy with them and, even better, my daughter loves them as well. While I received this item discounted price for testing and reviewing the product, I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My reviews are sincere and my own.",1

"I tried to keep my expectations pretty low for this, but I still found this item to be pretty worthless. I am going to attempt to keep an open mind and try more lenses in order to find something redeemable about this product.

Currently I use the adapter on an A7sii. I have not had a single a lens actually lock focus yet after 100s of attempts. I tried one EFS Canon Lens, a Sigma 18-35, and the Tamron 70-200. Perhaps this isn't ideal, but I was hoping to get some use out of the auto-focus.

The communication seems ok, but loads of items and functionality are immediately lost upon connecting a canon lens to a Sony body using this adapter. Some are bugs from hitting switches perhaps, some is just crashing, and much of it is poor explanation within Sony on what would best unlock functionality. I will try to narrow this down better and not immediately blame the adapter for at least some of these problems.

I could deal with all of this if it wasn't for the ghosting. Wow the ghosting is bad on my EFS 10-18. Just simple overhead lights which have never presented an issue on my 70D completely destroy pictures and videos and it must be from light bouncing and reflecting within the unit.

On the plus side it does feel pretty well built and the tripod mount seems well attached and easy to remove. I understand the tripod mount and removal/storage is a huge problem on the significantly more expensive (and passed over by me) Metabones adapter.

I hope to find some uses for this as I really only need limited autofocus functionality or at least the ability to shoot wide stable footage with the 10-18. For now my advice is to save your money and go native. The Sony 55mm 1.8 cross has been an awesome piece of glass so far.",0

"No complaints at all with this adapter.  I received this from Amazon prime, so it came very quickly.  After taking the adapter out from the box, it came with the device and a CD.  The CD is unnecessary from my experience.  All I had to do was plug it in the back of my computer and it instantly recognized and installed the drivers.  Once that was done, the bluetooth icon appeared on tray at the bottom.  I wanted to use this for my PS4 controllers.  My alienware x51 didn't have a bluetooth built in, therefore I needed to get something like this.  It worked like a charm with my ps4 controllers and my bluetooth speaker.  This is a must if you don't have bluetooth on your computer.  It's small enough to be barely noticeable. I have received the product for free or at a discount.

Amazon is my go-to store and I value honest customer feedback and reviews about products. Although I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review, I'm not going to be favorable to the seller or manufacturer if I don't recommend the product.

"I got this in Burgundy and was very excited for it to arrive after my last yoga bag broke a few weeks ago. Some things about this bag are great and some are just ok
my only criticisms are that:
the ""burgundy color is a little dull - the pictures i posted make it look a little more vibrant than it is, but that's ok its a nice muted color i was just hoping for one that is richer.
it is a little too small for my yoga mat - my mat fits in there nicely but mine is a bit longer than regular mats i guess even though its basic thickness - i have to roll mine tight, not in a lazy way before placing it in the bag and it also if unrolls while in the bag takes a tiny bit of effort to than get out of the bag - for all regular yoga mats this should not be a problem at all - for those with the very thick yoga mats - this is NOT  the bag for you. as for length - it fits perfectly - my pictures have the mat exposed just to see the circumference of my yoga mat - it is the perfect length for my yoga mat
the plastics thing that keeps the cord closed is really  really flimsy - it barely holds and i doubt it will last more than a few uses - but this is not a big deal really as it is very easy to just tie a bow.

the good:
this bag is SO well made for light simple canvas - it is very light but sturdy, the stitching is strong and even, the material a good level of thickness, it is sleek and not bulky and the strap part is adjustable and perfectly placed - this is the most comfortable yoga bag I ever used! also like others have noted the internal pocket with the zipper is really useful and a great size.

I really like this bag and would recommend it to someone who wants a simple lean bag that is also sturdy - also the material and color of mine give it a sorta earthy/hippie feel and not a sporty feel so i'd recommend it for someone who appreciates that aesthetic as well.

In exchange for my honest and unbiased review of this bag I was able to purchase the item at a discount",1

"As a small man (5'1"") it is difficult to find shoes in my size, I am a perfect 6.5.  I recently started a new job that requires ""dress casual"" shoes (i.e. ""NO SNEAKERS"").  Because 6.5 is usually considered a ""Boys"" size, often times they are made with a boy in mind, and boys don't fairly often wear dress shoes of any degree, at least not for long periods of time, so they are often made for appearance sake only, not for comfort. These were made with both in mind.  They are plush, soft, cushioned, and the shining leather gives them that ""professional"" look I must maintain while at work, while at the same time being comfortable enough for the 10 minute walk to the parking garage (up hill).  I would recommend these for anyone who wants a professional look with a casual feel.",0

This is a very nice multimeter with excellent functionality and is well made.  It has all of the necessary features in a small package and should handle all of my testing needs.  The display has a backlight feature and there is also a small ""spotlight"" on top of the device to provide some needed light in darker areas.  It is fuse protected, powered by two AAA batteries (supplied), and comes with a one year replacement warranty.

At this price point, this Dr. Meter Mini Digital Multimeter is an excellent choice!",1

"This mole repeller works! I don't know for sure if it works in the same 650 square meters that it claims to, but it ran my moles/voles from one part of my yard to another. My above ground pool could be a hindrance or obstacle for the underground sound. I have about half an acre of property to three quarters and this has made my mole/vole problem move to the other half of the property so I think that is pretty impressive.  I will get a couple more of these so that I can fully run him or them out and for the first time in years be mole/vole free! I dug a hole as per the full and detailed instructions, assembled the poles and made sure to pull the attached cable thru the middle end. I then connected the cable to the top of the solar head and attached the head to the metal pole. I felt and heard the vibration and sound every forty seconds as I tried to get it into the ground, in a very sunny place with a pre made hole. I did not put pressure on the device to get it into the ground and had to adjust the depth of my hole a couple of times to prevent myself from putting pressure on the device. I have used it for over a week now and will be buying more for myself so I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a mole/vole repellant.

"My husband and I have been looking for some really good salt and pepper grinders. We have finally found them. We have purchased other ones at different stores but ended up returning them. These grinders are made of very good materials. They will not break. The grinder is very strong and really does a great job. My husband does most of the cooking and he really loves these grinders. We prefer to use whole pepper and this really helps. They are very well designed. They look great just sitting on the counter or on the stove. I would definitely recommend these grinders to everyone I know. Great product!!!

"These replacement caster wheels for office chairs are surprisingly awesome.  One wouldn't expect such a difference over ""stock"" wheels, but honestly I can't imagine my life without these babies!

PROS:
~ bring a mad smooth glide to any chair with wheels.  On my laminate floors my chair now rolls around like greased lightening, smooth and silent.
~ easier on on surfaces, no marks or scratches left on the floor.
~ different color-ways offer the ability to match (or at least get close) to any chair style.  I went with all black to keep it simple and they go great with my chrome chair legs.
~ Insanely easy to install.  Literally, just pull your old wheels out, and push these new wheels in.

CONS:
~ A bit pricey @ $38.97 dollars for a set of 5, but they are good quality.

SUMMARY:
Basically, if you sit in a chair, you want it to be supported by these wheels.  You will just have to trust me on that one.  You won't regret upgrading your home or office chair with these.

"Okay, now other than as yet another gadget to employ to irritate my golf playing partners and further slow down play on the course, I cant say I have an essential use for this devicebut gadget.

Anyway, it seems to work pretty well with adjustable setting for meters per second, feet per minute, Knots, Kilometers/miles per hour accessible via a side positioned unit button with further settings for maximum and average wind speed interchangeable via an opposite side positioned mode button. The front positioned power button is conveniently located The LCD display is easy to read and features sensor activated backlighting with icon indication for battery charge status (it requires a 9v battery which is included).

The anemometer also has a temperature readout that can be toggled between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Temperature accuracy seems to be consistently a few degrees higher other household units that I have and trust. While the meter has a threaded mount for use with a tripod, is comfortably molded for hand-held use.

Notwithstanding the comments above regarding temperature reporting, the only other criticism I would have of this device is the base will not facilitate free standing but as it is a lightweight unit, even if it could stand independently a light gust would blow it into another dimension.

I think it makes everything look proportional, and the pink is very earthy looking and sensual. Do not be fooled by the innocent-looking product photos. This chemise is see-through, and it is meant to be that way. This will not be your nighty to wear around the kids. It will, however, be a nice surprise for hubby!

This product was purchased at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I purchased this for hiking and outings but I wasn't sure how comfortable it would be. It is easy to put on and comfortable to wear. I have it on my backpack now but I don't mind it for my wrist. It doesn't have some of the extras others on the market have but it has the basics and for the price it is a good deal. I would recommend.,1
"I am actually very pleased with the high quality and sturdy construction of this Car Phone Holder.  My husband has his gadgets for his side and I wanted something to use when we drive together to have on the passenger side.  I like to use my headphones and this keeps my phone from flying around when it's bumpy or fast stops etc.  My husband likes this alot and since I really don't need it for the passenger side let him use it and I use it when I'm driving!!  It really holds on tight where you place it and I like that it swivels... Sometimes I type a text or read an email for him while he's driving and it's easier to do with the way it rotates!  At first we thought it wasn't going to work with our S5 Galaxy phones.  There are a couple of ways that it works... You can put this Magnetic disk on the back of your phone... There are 2 of them... Or there is a plate you can put inside your phone case.  It's such a pain to remove your phone from most car phone holders... This you just can take it off easily as its held by a strong magnet!  It also has a place that is for you to put your cord through or actually holds it so you don't rip it off accidentally. I was surprised with so many negative comments as I don't think they actually knew how to use it correctly.  Our other old ones would fall off while driving and my husband would try replace them while driving... So I'd try help so we wouldn't get in a wreck.  This one holds really tightly and hasn't fallen off as its a really great design that's strong!!  I'm impressed with the high quality and design of this Car Phone Holder from LENTION!! I'll be looking for other products from this seller as this is a sturdy and great gadget!!  =)

"Nice device.  I gave this to my kids; I just hope they don't abuse its ""power"".",0
I received 2 bandanas/headbands. Each bandana was wrapped in its own see through pack. The material is Lycra or some type of spandex. It's more of a slippery material and not the thick or what regular headbands look or feel like. The colors are vivid and bright. They tend to be a bit snug to put on but so stretch and for the most part stay in place. It is comfortable to wear for the gym or just a bad hair day.

I think this case is really great. It feels sturdy and like it would protect my phone. The gunmetel color is really nice and looks great on my phone. The buttons on the side of the phone are really stiff to start out with but they soften over time. I really like this phone case.",1
"This is a really great item! I was afraid since it was coming from China and decently priced, that it would be poorly made or from very cheap fabric. This is not the case. The dress fits great, with a ruched back. The fabric is thick enough that I can wear off colored (not bright) undergarments without it showing through.  The colors on the fabric are bright and crisp. I need to wash it to see if the color runs, but the length is wonderful and the cut is nice. A couple of threads that needed to be clipped off, but nothing that spoke of structural issues.  The sweetheart neckline fits great, it isn't cut up to my collarbone or cut really low, seems proportional.  However, do not be mistaken.  It is not super structured or boned, but a great comfortable dress with a skirt that comes down to just below my knees. The dress was easy to put on and the skirt has ample fabric. It looks just like the picture and it fits well. I'm excited to wear it out because I can't find decently priced cotton dresses. Polyester, yes, but I won't brave the Oklahoma heat wrapped in plastic. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my review.",1

"I think the best way to describe the scarf is quirky!  It is not a triangle, the net like part is not equal to the linen part either- nor are either part are really triangles.  I also do not believe the scarf will hold up to any washing (other than an extremely delicate hand washing, but then you will have to iron since it will wrinkle due to wringing out).  I have the taupe color and the sequins are clear as well.  I did not purchase with the intent of having it forever or that it will be my go to scarf- if those are your intents then you will not be disappointed.  I did try to take some pictures to show the scarfs appearance not being worn, it is just not a scarf that is symmetrical. I did receive a discount on the scarf in exchange for my honest  review.",1

"I love this night light.  I ordered it to use in my infant's bedroom and it is perfect.  When I need to go into the nursery in the middle of the night to change or feed her, I try to avoid bright lights that would bring her to an alert state so I was looking for something with a softer, red-based tone to avoid the blue light that is emitted from cell phones and computer screens.  Although the bulb that this light comes with is clear, I feel the Himalayan salt cover is a softer glow and I like the health benefits that Himalayan salt lamps provide.  The particular salt cover that my light came with isn't all that red, but it casts is nice and gentle light in the room.  The light itself is very high quality, as well.  I am impressed with the construction, the way it fits together, and it looks great in the room.  It's well made and the only thing that I would like even more is if it came with a dimmer switch or an adjustment switch to toggle between low, mid, and bright light.  It is quite heavy when put together, but the salt cover fits snugly on the base with a rubber-based fitting so I am not concerned that it will fall apart or break if bumped.  I also like the feature it has where it can be positioned horizontally or vertically.  The Himalayan salt cover measures 2 1/2"" long and 2"" in diameter.  I am including a few pictures so you can see the assembly and get an idea of how bright the light is in a dark room.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair, unbiased review but would re-purchase and definitely recommend to others.",1
"This is the best thing in the world. I totally feel like I'm a pro at folding using this. My shirts all come out the same size and folded perfectly. No more funny creases or different sized folded shirts. It's so easy to use my husband has taken over folding laundry.  The plastic itself is good quality and a nice thickness, not flimsy at all, durable so far from the many times we've used it. I like that it's not super heavy either so I can move it around the house and fold clothes anywhere I'm not stuck in the laundry. It's very easy to use, tested by a 5 year old even and she could do it.

"I am EXTREMELY satisfied with these socks.
FIT: I bought the size 5-8 socks.  I am a size 7 in women shoes, and they fit me perfectly, they are stretchy too so I'm sure they fit smaller/bigger feet sizes as well.  The seller also sells size 8-13 pairs too.
FUNCTIONALITY: Prior to this purchase, I have only had one pair of flat socks which would ride down my foot over the course of the day which was very inconvenient.  With these pairs however, I never have that problem.  There are 3 tiny plastic wedges that keep the sock at the heel of your foot.
MATERIAL: The material feels great and I could really tell the difference wearing the socks through the day.

I highly recommend purchasing these socks if you are looking for comfortable wear for flats or other shoes.

"BUYER BEWARE!

If you are using these on a dumbbell handle where you can add plates, be very careful when using these locks, especially with heavier weight. They plates will slip! The lock is not tight enough....I was just working out and doing overhead tricep extensions when 25 lbs of plates slid off the handle and into the back of my neck. Did not feel very good. The lock was not tight enough to hold even that much weight.

Otherwise, they are a nice looking product.",0

"This cloth seems to keep me cooler, but I'm not really sure if it cools any better than a plain old wet cloth.  I tried ""snapping"" the cloth as the instructions said, but I did not notice a difference from the pre-snapped and post-snapped towel.  The towel definitely stays wet, even though the package says otherwise.  The cloth is very large, and easily covers my neck and can be tucked into my chest for extra cooling.  The material is very close to the texture and look of a plain microfiber towel.  I sweat a lot and live in Texas, so I had high hopes for this cooling cloth.  I'm just not sure if the cloth really works as it should or not - but the wet towel around the neck provides at least some relief from the heat.

"I think its a really cute swim suit and its a great alternative to a 2 piece especially for curvy women. I bought the size XL 10-12 and I'm 5'1 and 150 lbs with 38c chest. I've been wanting to get a swim suit that wouldn't make me look huge but would show my curves. The high waist is nice and is good for some tummy support but if you have wide set hips, it will dig in. The color is actually a hot pink and black but looks a little different in the stock photo. The color and design are very flattering and unique!! ALSO if you have a short torso, this is great for you! I am pretty short and this fit me but I thought it was kinda short for myself. So if you have a long torso and wide hips, this isn't the swimsuit for you. There isn't much support in the chest area and its fairly thin but gives enough coverage. The straps are pretty sturdy which is great and it does look pretty good on. I do have to disclose that I received a discounted rate for my unbiased, honest review which I'd say Im pretty honest in. I won't sugar coat something for a cheaper price, since I know how hard it is to find a comfortable swim suit being a curvy girl. Anyways- overall I'd give it 4.5 if possible. Its a good suit for the price.",1

"This is the best phone case I have ever have. All I am waiting for now is for it to be just that cool in the rest of my life. This case fits PERFECT! It is pretty much a part of the phone that came from the manufacturers at time of creation.

"I love these little slip ons at a great price!  They are pretty and are a solid shoe - this is a shoe store slip on, not a chain discount store slip on.  They are a suede like material which should have some give but they actually fit quite well.  I would order up one size.  I normally wear an 8 or an 8.5 if the shoe is narrow and these fit perfectly at a 9.  They look cute on and feel comfortable.

The inside does have some cushion built into the sole which should help with some arch support although no flat really gives great arch support in my opinion ~ these should be a little better than most!

The only thing I am unsure about is a velvety bottom?  It certainly makes your steps quiet but I am not sure what that may be like outside on concrete and wet grass etc but it does not change my mind on these being an excellent buy for the price!

Can't speak for anyone else, but I try to take my reviews seriously ~ I know how much I count on them when I am buying, especially online! I received this product at a discount for my honest and accurate review, but I am not obligated to leave a positive review, nor do I receive any incentives or monetary compensation to do so. My goal is to help buyers understand aspects of an item I would like to know before purchase. I am not affiliated with any company and am a normal consumer just like you. I pick items to review that I would normally want to purchase. (I don't do reviews for things I would already deem to be junk). I would never write a review for a product that is anything but my personal opinion and I have already purchased the product, nothing changes for me based on my review, but hopefully the time I put into writing can help someone out. Please feel free to ask me a question about any of the products I've reviewed; I am happy to help if I can!",1

I'm new to the decorating cake world so I saw these with high reviews and decided to give it a try. They work great! They also work well with other couplers (clear plastic piece that keeps the tips on).

Definitely worth the money!,0
"Easy 4+ Star rating from me. Could be a 5-star but then I'd have to stack it up next to more expensive flashlights.

Very nice machining. A lot of aluminum housing flashlights coming out of China look great until you look closely at the threads under the battery cap. The threads under this cap are coated like the rest of the flashlight, and they are machined smooth: there are no burrs or hangs of any kind on the sample I received. Some of the others you have to be careful not to gall the threads when putting on the cap.

With three double A batteries I could get a nice solid cone of light. I have no way of measuring actual lumens. Some reviewers claim it's not 1200 but maybe it is it with a Li-Ion (LiOn) battery in it. I compared it to two other tactical lights from China. The Comunite was brighter than my two other test lights; one of the others was powered by three AAs and one was powered with an 18650 LiOn battery. I also used the 18650 Li-Ion battery in the Comunite 1200 (even though it calls for a 26650) and it does indeed put out more light with the LiOn battery than it does with the AA alkaline batteries. Again, I can't say for sure if it's 1200 Lumen.

The other test flashlights I put this one against were smaller in size, and had a smaller lens, but all three batteries had identical battery requirements. The illumination from the Comunite was the best of the three.

As with a lot of LED flashlights, when you pull out the focus to its farthest position to use it as a spot, you see the chip.

I like the size and feel of this light in my hand. It's a good size.

The 18650 Li-Ion battery I tested with this flashlight had a much smaller diameter than the battery housing (18mm compared to 26mm) and it took me two tries to get it centered properly. I would not recommend using the smaller diameter LiOn battery, but you could in a pinch, as long as you have it centered.

"It has several different settings for the lights/waves. either way no matter what color or setting I put it on I plug it into my tablet or phone and it will play my relaxation music . NOw, the volume is rather settle and low on this projector and unless the room is quiet it's likely hard to hear but for night time or when i'm meditating /. relaxing this works so perfect. when i'm in bed at night I can hear the music just enough to sound me to sleep. When I feel my anxiety rush through my body I simply shut the lights off plug in my tablet to this and everything else is quiet this really sets a rather calm and relaxing mood. I really like how it has rather wide projection. Even though I keep this in the corner of my room on a stand it still lights up practically my whole room walls and ceiling so for that I'm really thankful. Now this is also portable meaning it can run on batteries or just be plugged in which i'm also happy about because I can easily bring this to motels and hotels when I travel which I do end up traveling a lot and this really helps ease my anxiety. ALso I really like the hour feature it just runs for an hour after turning it on and shuts off so I do not need to worry about getting back up and turning it off which is a major convenience to me, I get to get all relaxed and just fall right asleep or when i'm meditating away my anxiety this sets the mood and acts as a timer for me by stopping on an hour mark. this projector is rather durable it is not cheaply made and I really am super happy with how this is helping me in many ways. I highly recommend this specially if you have a child a baby or maybe you're like me and need it. either way this works great also it's affordable portable and even helps ease my pain when I have a headache. definitely recommend this . awesome quality and really happy with it.

"What I like about the product:

1. MOUNTING: Suction cup mount is of good quality and holds well to windshield. Camera is easily adjustable and can be rotated 180 degree to record inside the car OR through the side window.
2. SETTINGS: The UI is little complicated. Not easy to navigate. It took me 20 min to figure out and do the settings I wanted.
3. VIDEO QUALITY: Video recording is of great quality. Camera provides 1920 x 1080 resolution as advertised. Front cars license place can be recognized from 20 ft distance.
4. BUILD QUALITY: Camera is made of high quality ABS plastic. You can tell the quality as soon as you take it out of the box.
5. SCREEN SIZE: Screen LCD is 3.0. I
6. AUTO ON: Camera does come ON automatically when car starts and small red LED comes on to indicate start of recording.
7. MOTION DETECT: Camera has a Motion sensor and it starts recording whenever it detects any motion. Good feature for monitoring parking activity. This feature can be turned OFF from settings.
8. CHARGING: It has 300mAh battery and can only work when connected to cars power port. It can record for 3-5 mins if power is not available..
9. AUTO RESTRICTED SAVE: Camera auto saves the current video loop in separate folder when it detects any collision. The sensitivity of G-sensor can be adjusted. A loop can also be saved manually by pressing a button so that it does not get over written.
10. GPS: Camera has a GPS unit which comes with option mounting. It tracks and displays the GPS location using their own software. The Video also displays the car speed which is very handy in case of insurance claims.
11. 32 GB SD card is included. I like this because you can start using it right away.

What I did not like:

1. UI: User interface is not that good and navigating through requires some patience.

Here are additional details:
Features:

Frame Rate: 30 Frames / Sec
Audio Sample Rate: 32 kHz

Would you buy this Product again?: YES !!
Would you recommend this product to others?: YES !!

To sum it up, this camera absolutely does the job if you just need a set-and-forget security camera. (There are even cheaper cameras, but I definitely don't recommend those as the quality is too bad to be usable long term).

"I'll be honest here, if I wanted a five star pair of pedals I would have spent $60 or more at the local bike shop. The thing is, I'm not that hardcore of a rider so pedals at this price seemed like a fine compromise. I originally had bought a cheap pair at that big box store we all know, and the set was interchangeable between the 1/2"" and 9/16"" sizes. Great idea but they just did not work. Five mins into my bike rides they would start to unscrew. These pedals fix that problem and look even better! Great price for a decent pedal.

These treats however my dogs loved.

We recently got a new puppy and so I wanted a smaller easier to chew treat for the puppy to try especially since she is in training and these were ideal for her. These are a soft treat so i don't know how well they will work with dental issues but they are quite dense so I could see where they will be beneficial. They are easy to break in half which is good when you are puppy training.

Both of my dogs ate these right up, my big dog Sookie ate hers with in a matter of seconds (to be fair she can eat almost anything within seconds) and our new dog, Atari, takes a little longer with them. I didn't have any issues with them upsetting the puppy's stomach which can be an issue with puppies being introduced to new things.

My favorite thing about Best Bully Stick products is that they are made in the USA and made with good, natural products. Having a dog who recently passed away with cancer I will try what I can to make sure my dogs are as healthy as I can.

"These Riverberry Women's Piper Round Toe High Heels are nicely made but are a tad small! I got the Black PU option in size 9 and while I normally wear 9-10 (depends on the shoe) these are just a tad bit big on me; I think the 8.5 would have been too small since the 9's aren't too far off since I can walk in them without too much looseness. The heels on these are 4"" which are perfect for me as they aren't too high or uncomfortable on my feet. These heels do come with extra caps for the heels so if something happens to the originals you can just switch them out; I love this as it'll help these last longer! These high heels do have some padding in them which does help keep your feet comfortable while wearing them for long periods of time! These heels can be worn with just about any outfit and for any occasion! I would definitely recommend these Riverberry Women's Piper Round Toe High Heels!

"I got the product a few weeks after buying, but ahead of estimated shipping date, which was good. It came in a opaque white plastic ziploc bag sort of deal as well as the standand shipping packaging, when opened i was immediately hit with a chemical like smell but im sure it will fade with a few washes. It was folded nicely and everything is correct and appears to be the same size as on the photo. I purchased a LARGE and as a 5'8"" girl that weighs roughly 130-140 lbs the large is a bit small. As in it isn't a loose fitting baggy crew neck, however its workable hopefully it won't shrink!! The sleeves are a bit short but again nothing major, quality is great and overall i don't regret buying it i just wished i had went two sizes up from my normal size!! I have pictures and will add them if i can later",0
"Goggles are very important in my household. We swim all the time in our pool. And in Florida swimming is almost year round. I have gone through goggle left and right over the past 8 years of having a house with a pool. Through the years I can tell you after only 2 to 3 days goggles have failed us. I have swimmers and they put these through the test. One best thing noted by them was the uv ray protection. They said their eyes nearly,y hurt from the sun after wearing them so long and then taking them off. So that tells me since our pool is completely in the open their eyes are not only protected from the chlorine but also the damage they could sustain from the sun. They said they were so comfortable they almost forgot they were wearing them. The clasp made them really easy to put on and off. So far another great feature I have yet to find in a pair of goggles. They were simple to adjust too. They have never been known to use nose plugs however they have loved the pair that come with the goggle and now I never see them swimming without them. The ear plugs was another bonus item that came with them. They haven't used those as much. I did test them out. I would say if you require them to swim they are pretty good. It's just not something we needed, thank goodness because I know there are many that it is a must for water to not get in the ears while swimming. They stayed in my ears and did not allow water in them. I absolutely love the case they came with. That will help in taking care for these well loved goggles and being sure to keep up with them for a while. I am honestly happy that I didn't have to run out to the store after 3 days to make another purchase. Even though I received these at a discounted price for my honest opinion. I am very satisfied. And with a lifetime warranty I am thinking IF anything goes wrong with these I will be covered for a new pair. Now that was not something offered by any other that I have seen either. I plan to purchase more of these for my guest swimmers so they can have the same experience!!",1

"Let me start by saying that this will only work on an LG G4, which I have. I've never used a tempered glass screen protector before. This is my first one. It was actually very easy to apply to my phone. Easier than those plastic stickers that you use as screen protectors. The best part is that there are no bubbles after aplying it. Bubbles are the worst! So any ways.. You place everything that it comes with your package out on a table. You then take the wet wipe and wipe your screen and then you take the dry wipe and wipe your screen again. Then you take the dust remover sticker and remove any dust that may be on there. You then line up your tempered glass and remove the plastic backing and stick the glass to your phone and smooth it out so that you do not have any bubbles. It instantly will make your screen look high definition. The tempered glass is scratch proof, finger-print proof and glare proof. The tempered glass does not effect your ability to add a phone case to your phone for more protection, so you can still have your favorite phone case

It is a good product for a small area. It did work and I  saw that attracted small flying insects. The light is subtle.  Easy to dispose tray at the bottom that holds insects. I needed something more powerful since insects were bigger than this small lamp could handle.,0
I liked the compact size. It didn't get in the way of the air flow from the air conditioner. It held in place snug enough with no worries of it falling off the vent. It was easy to place the phone in the phone mount. One side extends easily to place your phone in the mount and springs back into place to hold the phone. The rubber clasp has a cross slit opening to easily insert on vent. A good product to take on vacation when renting a car. I got this product for free.,1
"This is a beautiful lingerie set! It comes with the pull over and it ties shut in the front. It also comes with a beautiful g-string style under wear. The breast part of the top as well as the under wear have a. Really pretty see threw lace with rose designs in the lace. I wear a US size Xl usually, got this in size Xl, it was a little.smaller than I expected maybe fits like a size large, but it is still beautiful and makes you feel a little bit more sexy when u but it on.

"I am in love with this journal!  From the moment I unpacked it, the pleasant scent of leather was apparent.  I personally love how leather smells, so this made me happy!  The handsome gift box is sturdy, and the inside is lined with foam, which holds the leather journal and a classy looking ink pen in place.
The pen has a nice weight to it, and it feels good to write and draw with.  It actually has a cap that you attach to the end of the pen while it's in use (which is almost a rarity to see these days).  The journal itself has a soft, smooth leather cover, which is held shut by a leather strap on the front.  The actual paper inside is a replaceable booklet that is held in place by slots in the leather cover.  The pages are off white, blank, and quite soft.  The paper looks like it was recycled or made from plant matter, as the pages have a unique look and feel to them.  The journal comes with a small, rectangular, leather bookmark to use as well, which I thought was a really cool feature.
I am actually using this journal as a sketchbook, but be careful when using pencils with hard lead, since the paper is pretty delicate.  I really appreciate the craftsmanship that went into putting this journal and pen set together.  This would make a fantastic gift for any writer or artist.

"They look great when they work but be aware that water gets inside when it rains and rusts the battery housing underneath the top of the lantern. When you try to change the battery,you have about a 50% chance the lantern will light again. Seems like the manufacturer could use washers or something to keep the moisture out. Regardless, I like them so much I buy them year after year. Would be great if the manufacturer corrected the defect since they are designed for outdoor use.",0

"I received these ear rings within 2 days after ordering (being a prime member).

I ordered these earrings for my wife who loves to wear all kinds of casual, contemporary as well as ethnic/traditional jewellery. This was a surprise for her and she was very happy when she opened the box and wore it immediately.

What I liked about the product:
1. As advertised: This is the most important aspect when you are buying the jewellery online. Including the color and size, everything matched the description and the photos uploaded on the amazon website.
2. Made my wife happy! Do I need to write anything more? :D
3. Nice packaging: It arrived in a small golden box. A perfect thing for gifting. No need to gift-wrap or anything.
4 Variety of options to choose: Although I chose the Gold Plated red crystals (my wife likes red color), all the other options were equally good.

What I did not like:
Nothing so far.

"This is an okay product. I have had a small issue with one small part not wanting to stick to my cupboard door. There was something on the door that I hadn't realized didn't come off with the washing before application. User error. It isn't too bad though and the spice rack is still useable.
They are plain, b-flat plastic strips that can be attached by double sided tape. The tape comes preapplied to the rack. You just decide where you want them and peel and stick. They could be cut in between each individual spice bottle spot to make customization easier. Standard spice bottles such as you buy in a normal grocery store fit well in these.
These are a good space saver. If you don't want something shiny and fancy to display you spices,  and you need all the space you can get, this is the product for you!
When I received my spice racks, the box was pretty thrashed, but the plastic strips were brand new.

"I am a huge coffee and tea person. I LOVE this kettle. I recently started drinking french press coffee in the morning which requires me to boil water which was a huge pain in the butt for me since I was just never awake and had to get all the supplies out. I just needed something easier for me especially in the mornings (i'm not a morning person, as you can tell.) This kettle was an amazing addition to my routine. All i had to do was fill it up with water and flip a switch. Depending on the amount of water inside it would take 30 seconds to a minute or two to boil. Extremely fast and HOT. Perfect!!!!! I'm in love. It's perfect for tea. It boils to the perfect temperature. (The bottom does get hot so I would exercise caution and not leave around children) It's a great quality product and looks stylish in my kitchen. I just leave it on the countertop and it looks great next to my stainless steel coffee maker as well. I have not cleaned it yet but when the water calcifies I will mix two parts water with one part vinegar and let it boil inside. I just would recommend for anyone looking to simplify their tea/coffee routine.

"I'm not a huge jewelry guy in general, but this is a nicely made ring that fit snugly on my finger. It looks a little big on my fingers due to the thickness of the band, and with a bit of weight due to how well made it is. I definitely could wear this around. The price is nice as well.

"These hand towels are great. Perfect for drying hands after washing the dishes. Great to have in the bathroom to dry yourself off after shaving or washing your hands or face.

The material is soft but not too soft to the point where it loses its effectiveness at drying.

The size is perfect for use as a hand towel. It is big enough and absorbent enough to use as a full size towel (eg drying after a shower) in a pinch.

When you first open the package, it will have a slight chemical smell. I would suggest washing the towels before using them.

I'd recommend this product to anyone who for a soft yet absorbent set of hand towels at a reasonable price.

"True to size!
I was lucky enough to be given the awesome opportunity to purchase this item with a discount on this product in order to provide an honest and unbiased review of the product, in my own words with only how I feel about it, not an inflated review. As such, I do tend to write reviews as honestly as I can, but I also know that because I was able to receive the product at a discount, that that may bias my opinion of the product, so I tend to try to imagine that I had had to pay whatever the full price was for the product at the time I made the purchase, rather than a smaller amount based on the discount, so basically imagine that I did not get a discount, and base my review off of that (sorry if that was confusing). I am hopeful that that helps with the bias and makes my review a more accurate tool for judging the worth of the product, rather than just something that people gloss over and ignore because of the ""I got a discount"" disclaimer at the bottom of the review. As a final addition to this disclaimer, I try to base the length of the review solely off what I feel needs to be said about the product, so some reviews will be quite lengthy and wordy (kind of like this disclaimer), while others will be short, sweet, and to the point (like when the product just straight up works or is just awful - there's only so many ways to say that).  TL:DR - I got a discount, but tried to not be biased.",1
"I absolutely love these shoes.  They looked okay in the picture but they are much cuter in person.  They are so light and comfortable!  They are easy to put on and are very breathable!  They look so cute to wear with my workout clothes and I am thrilled that I ordered these!  It too a little while to arrive but they were worth the wait.  I wait a pair in every color.  I have already gotten so many compliments on them. They look cute with jeans and a t-shirt or super cute with workout clothes.  They look like the Kanye West Yeezee shoes which are around $350 a pair.  So so cute!

"I just recently bought a S5, so i decided I needed to get a case for it. I bought S5 Case, Galaxy S5 Case, GoodPro Powerful Protection 3IN1 Color Mix Design Hybrid Rubber Silicone Protection Bumper Armor Samsung Galaxy S5 Case Cover, (Black+Green Included Screen Protector, Stylus and Cleaning Cloth), Samsung Galaxy S5 Case. I had some issues with the mailing system. The told me it was delivered one day but it never showed up. I waited a few days and then it showed up. Granted it showed up earlier than it was suppose to but I thought some one maybe hadn't taken it out of the mail box or maybe they dropped it on the front porch and someone picked it up.
After all that when it finally showed up it I couldn't even get the case on. I tried but it seriously felt like I was going to break the phone. My little sister tried but I told her not to break my phone because she couldn't afford to buy me a new one. Finally my step dad shoved the phone in the case literally sounding like it was breaking. Now I am scared to even take it off my phone.

"I was searching for an item that would allow me to carry the main items that I use in my purse without having to actually carry my purse.  This item has plenty of card slots for cards or cash.  My phone fit perfectly into the case part of this wallet/phone case and was easy to switch this out with my other case.  I was able to fit this in my coat or pants pocket easily.

"This review is for the Galaxy Note 5 Case, TORU [CX PRO] - [CARD SLOT] [ID Holder] [KICKSTAND] Protective Hidden Wallet Case with Mirror for Samsungp Galaxy Note 5 - Metal Slate

This phone case is pretty cool, I'm not a big fan of cardholder cases but this one stood out to me for some reason. You can fit 3 different cards in this case but when you open the  one card will always fall out so when I do end up using this case i only put my bank card and my I.D

The case covers my phone 100 and there is a lip around the screen that will protect it against face first falls. The kickstand doubles as the card door works as described, it is a little flimsy but if you are an adult then you won't have a problem.

The cut outs for the S-pen, microphone, speaker, USB port and headphone jack are perfect the volume rockers and power button are covered but can be pressed easily without a problem.

Overall, I like this case even though I'm not a fan if card holder cases

"This motion sensing light is easy to use and easy to install. It comes with two strong 3M stickers that you can use or you can use the screws and anchors it comes with to secure it to the wall. I chose to use the 3M hooks for ease and they have held up very well.

There are 3 settings: on, off and auto. When it is on ""on"" the light remains lit constantly. On ""auto"", the light only comes on when it senses motion in the dark. Off is self explanatory.

The light is bright enough to illuminate enough to be able to see where you are going in the dark but not so bright that it might wake someone who was nearby up. The light is LED light so it's very white and crisp.

The design of the light is also very clean and nice looking. It doesn't look out of place in my house.

"This is my 3rd smart watch and it has some good features compared to others, but is missing a few things. What it really all boils down to is that it's a good watch for the price. Right now it's listed at $19.99, which is a steal. Recently I've paid that amount for a normal watch, so my expectations of this aren't super high. Here's some thoughts:

FUNCTIONS: I'm going to give a brief description of each function and how it's worked for me.
-Bluetooth: This first icon is how you connect or disconnect your phone.
-Phonebook: Once linked to my phone my phonebook from there populates over to the watch.
-Dialer: Standard dial pad
-Messages: Read your texts. This has worked intermittently for me. When I first paired my watch all my messages came through. Now it's saying ""Please install BT Notice app in remote device"". I lost my instructions, so I'm not sure what to do. But I can say that it worked at first and now it's not. I'll find the instructions eventually and figure it out.
-Calls: Missed, dialed and received calls show up here.
-BT Notice: It just says to please install it.
-BT music: Whatever I play on my phone comes through to the watch when I open this. I can turn the volume up and down or skip and go back.
-BT camera: It says please install the app at this time. Previously it worked for me. It basically controlled my phones camera shutter from the watch. Then the pictures were saved in my gallery. Kinda nice for taking family photos or what not. It's basically like a Bluetooth remote.
-Settings: This goes into things like display and units of measurement.
-Antilost: This alerts you when you get a certain distance from your phone. It could be handy, but I found that doing things like running out to my car set it off. I turned it off. Good if you always have your phone on you and want to be alerted if you walk away.
-Power saving mode: Can be turned on or off, not sure what it does.
-Tools: Calendar, alarm, calculator and stopwatch. I want to note that one of my other smart watches doesn't have a stopwatch. This was kind of a big deal for me since I like to run and like to keep trace of my distance, pace and time. I really like having a stopwatch.
-Barometer: I'm not sure how accurate it is, but it has temp, pressure and altitude measurements.
-Pedometer: Very primitive in design, but surprisingly it works pretty darn well. I did a few trials where I walked around and counted my steps and compared it to this and it was more accurate than either of my other watches. When I walk 100 steps it's within 6 steps of accuracy, which is pretty good compared to others. It is about as basic as a pedometer can get though.
-Sleep monitor: I haven't used this mostly because I don't want to wear my watch all night.

The biggest reason I always chose this over my other smart watches is the home screen. Both of my Overall, it's definitely not the best, brightest, most feature packed watch out there. But, it does some basic functions well and is cheap enough that if you crack the screen, lose it or just decide a smart watch isn't for you it won't be a big deal. I was sent this for testing and review. I am always honest with my reviews whether it be positive or negative.

"Works well. There was a slight issue when the product arrived but once I contacted the seller they more than solved it. We spend a lot of time outdoors and most weekends in the mountains. I got these hoping the little kids would wear them not wanting to cover them in a nasty spray. The kids thought they were fun. Before the night was over they had figured out these made cool headbands. Either on the wrist or on the head these kept the kids bite free. When the night was over I asked the kids for them back and put them in the resealable bag they came in. When the kids came to visit again the next night I got the bag out and they were excited to wear them again and they worked just as well the second night

"These auxiliary cords are so cute and compact; I LOVE them. They're not too long, three feet is just the right measurement and I love the variety of the colors to match any occasion I need them for. The flat style of the cord is what makes these a must-have. It's slim and does not get in the way; also the flat style makes them impossible to get tangled. It's such a great buy for a whole TEN auxiliary cords and I'll definitely be recommending/buying these as gifts.

"I was excited to get these shorts for my husband.  He loves sleeping in this style of shorts and also just wearing them to lounge around.  Overall, the shorts are great, good fabric, great price and the fit is ok.  My only complaint for the fit is they're too long.  They hang well below the knees.  So to fix this my husband rolls them up once or twice.  I'd still recommend these shorts, the price and quality can't be beat.  $8.99 is so much better then paying $15 a pop at local retailers.

I like this size because they are not too big but not so small you can barely see them. A nice medium size in my opinion. They are about 0.9 inches in total length. They don't weigh a lot either. I find them comfortable on my ears. I like this latch closure. They are quick and easy to open and close. They stay put also on my ears and have not opened up on me by accident.

The Peridot stones are a pretty light Green color. Almost like a lime Green. The stones are small at about 3 X 5 mm. I really love this color. Each earrings does have a teeny tiny little diamond. But they are very small and require a magnifying glass to see them. So don't get this if you are expecting big visible diamonds. The diamond is right below the first Peridot from the top. It is in the middle of that metal disc. It may look like the entire thing is a diamond but it is not. The metal is etched so from far away it gives the illusion of being a bigger diamond. The second metal disc toward the bottom does NOT have a diamond. Only in the center of the top one. So look carefully and closely so you know exactly what you are getting.

These earrings are Brass with a Platinum plating on top. That is good so the plating keeps these looking bright and nice for longer. They did not irritate my ears or turn colors.

For the price these are pretty nice. I am a big fan of Peridot so I am happy with these earrings. They came in a simple Black and Red cardboard gift box.

"The Timex watch is a great watch.  It fits well, the indigo light is terrific.

"I purchased this tiara on May 24, 2016 with no rush shipping. It was delivered on June 1, 2016. It came in a box with other items that I had purchased. It was neatly packaged and easy to open. It looks just like the posted photo.

This affordable tiara is perfect for me to wear to my bridal shower. It is light and shiny. There is a five toothed comb on the end of both sides of this tiara to help secure it to my hair. The metal is magnetic so I will have to apply a clear coat seal on it if I want to wear it in the rain or to the beach. Otherwise, I will have to remember not to get it wet or else it will rust. The words Bride to Be are legible and the tiara is a solid one piece. I noticed that there are two glitter stones missing from the tiara. One is the second to the last on the left end of the tiara band. The other is right under the left strand side of the middle loop. It is hardly noticeable if no one is looking at it closely but in my meticulous manner, I had to inspect every inch of it before I can say that this tiara is perfect. For the intended purpose of this tiara, I have no other complaints.

"I love to travel and always looking to look cute and travel light. From the first time I saw these shorts in Spain I fell in love and when I was offered a complimentary sample by Simplicity in exchange for an honest review I was thrilled! I am 120lbs and 5'3"" an the M size fit perfect. When the shorts arrived I literally jumped up and down because they are beautiful and look amazing on. I've worn and washed them multiple times and they are in perfect condition.

Here is what I like (pros):

1. Thin yet sturdy material, perfect for beach trips and all on the go needs
2. Elastic waste band helps my body look slim and looks great with any top
3. Black background with pink roses is beautiful, can be dressed up with heels and black top
4. Light and easy to pack, great for hot weather
5. Super comfortable and soft material
6. Fashionable and easy to wear
7. Love the border, very well sown

Room for improvement (cons):

1. Fits smaller than expected, I usually wear XS/S and ordered a M which fits perfectly
2. Short are made for warm weather (although I wore them with leggings and they look great)

Overall I would recommend these shorts. They are very inexpensive, fashionable and well made. I get tons of compliments when I wear them. I will be getting a pair for my cousin's 23rd birthday, because I know she'll love them.",1
"Wanted this as a hidden indoor camera, but the center ring around the aperture glows bright blue when it's on,  motion detection wasn't the greatest either. Set it to a very sensitive setting and left it on all day to see what kind of shenanigans the dogs get up to while we are at work and it only caught the couple times the dogs walked right up to it.",0
"I have several types of rings, from titanium to tungsten, oddly enough they are inexpensive, so I like to have a variety. This was a type I didn't have as of yet, and so I went ahead and ordered one to try it out.

It's a nice looking ring, very deep black and both matte and glossy (the middle section is glossy) and has a nice groove that looks to be carbon fiber. One downside of titanium and carbon fiber though is that both materials are exceptionally light, and thus, this ring has almost no weight to it. Really, to the point that it's kind of unsettling. I prefer personally something to feel a bit more substantial, but that may come down to personal preference.

Aside from it's weight and what it looks like (it's really quite nice looking) there is the comfort and fit. I ordered a size eight and this is dead on a correct eight, so that's a plus, the fit itself, I can only rate about three stars. The edges are smooth, and free of marks or burs, but the ring itself is very light as I mentioned and very thin, so the edges are a little less than comfortable and kind of prone to getting caught on things if it's even slightly too big, a real shame considering the lack of half sizes in this model.

Overall, if you like the style, it's a nice affordable ring, and I'll be holding on to mine. I would like it if it was a little thicker, and a little more rounded around the edges, but these are small complaints over all.

I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, and after wearing the ring for a couple of days, this is more or less my conclusion.",1
"By far the easiest waffle maker I've used and cleaning it is a breeze.  I used to own one of the cheapie ones where you had to scrape between the waffle squares, not this one.  We use different batters with a buttermilk base and it cooks the waffles perfectly.  We undercook ours and freeze them to pop in the toaster for later and they come out great.  The locking mechanism for storage is useful and the handle stays cool while cooking.  We've managed to make many batches of crispy, yummy waffles with this.  The only con for me is they don't provide a time to go with the setting so you can set for a level 5, but you'll have to time it yourself to know the actual cook time.  I found to make a crispy waffle I need to leave it in for longer than what the beep/timer is.",0

Also, I find it is easier to put them together and fill them thru the small holes rather than filling with water and then trying to put the two pieces together.  You have to play with them at first a few times to get the hang of it.  If they weren't so messy I would give them 5 stars.",0
"If this map were in the form of a poster, itd easily be a 5 star review in my book. The problem is mine arrived completely creased up with many different little folds in it. This means that no matter how hard I try, the map has bubbles and look bad on my wall. Also, the map has difficulty sticking to my wall once on. It feels as if I have to frequently re-stick the map to my wall. In short, this means that despite how much I like the visuals of the map, it is virtually unusable. I think that this map might be better if it came in the form of a poster, instead of basically a sticker that you stick onto your wall. This would take get rid of the bubbles and other things that make this map not worth it in my book. I had high expectations for this map, and unfortunately, they were not met.

"I really like this scarf. I got the open style, big finch print, teal green color. The infinity style is a faster to get ""right"", but the open end style is much more versatile. The teal is a deep, vibrant blue-green, every bit as intense as the picture.

The size of this scarf is very large, it could be worn as a sarong and easily cover hips to mid calf. It would be harder to wear as a head wrap unless you have a real knack for those complicated twists and knots. It weighs about nothing, floating instead of puddling, and has an almost fluffy feel to it, no crisp folds or scratchiness.

It is sheer to semi-sheer as a single layer. This color, at least, would be a great beach cover up. It's opaque enough to actually cover without looking at all frumpy, and it hangs close but isn't clingy.

"I have two wonderful Pomeranians, but they can be quite ""chatty.""  I have been looking for something to help decrease their barking and increase obedience and am unwilling to resort to inhumane bark collars.  This product arrived on time and as expected from the manufacturer.  The product was packaged well and had no damage.  The whistle is attached to a lanyard which makes it very convenient for me to use.  I just put the lanyard around my neck before I take my pups outside tor their walks and I am prepared.  My dogs bark the most uncontrollably when they see other dogs.  I blow the whistle once they begin barking and it startles them and gets their attention.  I then command them to walk in the other direction to put more distance between the other dog and us.  In the cases where other dogs are close by the whistle is much less effective.  It seems impossible to get their attention using the whistle when other dogs are close by and my dogs are yapping wildly.

I am pleased overall with the results from this whistle.  My dogs respond to it when they are barking at a mild to moderate level; however, do not respond well to the whistle when they are barking at a high level.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in doing whistle training with their pups.  I was able to receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest an unbiased review.",1

"Utopia Bedding Queen Hypoallergenic Waterproof Mattress Protector

I have a 4 year old son that has not learned to wake up at night to use the bathroom. I put him in a diaper to sleep, but sometimes an overnight diaper is not enough to hold his urine and he wets through his diaper, pjs, sheets, and mattress cover. This mattress cover helps to protect my mattress on those nights. It is waterproof for a short period of time, but will not hold the water indefinitely. Many times the urine has soaked into my mattress through this protector. I think that high heat in the dryer might have something to do with it, so I recommend drying this on the delicate cycle to prevent the plastic underside from wearing out. It fits my mattress well and is big enough for deep mattresses or pillow tops.

"This combination lantern/flashlight by High Mountain Tiger (model number GSH-7088A), has some neat features and creative design elements.  The multipurpose device is powered by an internal battery which can be recharged either by AC power, or by a solar cell located on the top of the device.  A short cord that plugs into a standard 120 volt receptacle is included.  A small red light comes on when the battery is being charged by either method, but there is no indicator for when the battery is fully charged.

A button near the base controls the power.  Pressing it once turns on the flashlight, pressing it again switches the flashlight off and turns the lantern on.  And finally, pressing the button again turns off the lantern.

The flashlights LED produces a tight white beam of light, which is not adjustable.  Light intensity is fairly bright, but is not overpowering.  As a flashlight performance is good, but not outstanding.  The plastic outer housing is tough and durable, and appears to be weather resistant to some extent.

The lantern retracts into the body of the device, and works best when it is fully extended.  There are six tiny LEDs positioned inside a white bulb shaped diffuser, which evenly distributes light through 360 degrees.  The device has a rubber handle that can be set in two different positions, one when used as a flashlight, and the other when used as a lantern.

I received a sample for evaluation, and the cost seems reasonable for a double duty device.  It is more impressive as a lantern, as the light output is fairly bright and very even.  Durability, and the availability to recharge using solar power, makes this a practical choice for camping or other activities where electrical power is not available.

The lantern will turn on even when it is fully retracted, which is not so good.  There is a slight gap between the retractable sections, so if the light level is not too bright, you can tell if the light on.  If the battery does accidentally drain down, at least the device can easily be recharged.",1

This is a really good pump for you to purchase to pump up all your sports balls. It comes in two parts.  The main part is the air pump itself and then they have an attachment that screws on with the needle which would get inserted into the ball.

"I've wanted to try an expandable hose for several years but my husband kept 'poo pooing' me. Well, I went ahead and ordered this without telling him. First, it was 50 feet and I knew that would cover my backyard and reach plants by my garage which is not connected to my house. I am in my 60s and I hated to drag a heavy hose around and then have to roll it up on the hose stand. My hands were filthy and when it is really hot out...well, let's say I get really grumpy. I took this hose out of the box and my husband was skeptical yet impressed with the brass fittings. He hooked it up for me and I went out to water my plants. What a joy and difference it makes! Without water, it is light as a feather. I slowly turned the faucet on to fill and it still was managable to direct around the backyard. It comes with a sturdy faucet attachment with several settings. All the settings worked perfectly except the soaker. Makes no difference to me but seemed to be a talking point with the hubby. Maybe that's how a soaker is supposed to work. Anyway, after turning off the water, I still compressed the attachment to empty the hose. It retracted right back to its original size and I easily placed it back in a tub where we now keep our hose. I hope this hose lasts for years because I will not use another one for the future.

"This is a large oversized watch and watch face that is not going to be suitable for everyone, if your a large person or just a person that wants to be able to read the watch dials without reading glasses, then this watch may be of interest to you.

It is black with black face, trimmed out in gold, with a gold second hand, gold numerals and a white glow -in -the- dark hour and minute hands.

The watch has many features and though I wanted a big faced watch so I could easily see the dials, this is to oversized even for me, ,  but my son is going to be wearing this watch and I will leave it up to him to do the other settings if they are things that he may want to use

Setting the basic time watch hands were easy enough, and using the green light back lighting is just a push of a button, but to access the other features takes a bit more time and are not something I would use anyway.

The watch keeps good time, when I compare it to my cell phone or computer time it is right on.

I am not fond of the watch band very much, it is advertised by seller as being ABS elastic band.  But it just feels like plastic to me and I am not sure that I like it very much.  I guess only time can tell how it will hold up but at this moment it is fine.

All  in all.. I love the gold and black and the white glow minute and hour hands.  It is water resistant and the watch itself feels quite solid and durable.

The watch comes in a nice black tin with the name Skmei in raised silver letters on the side... nice packaging and attractive set up

If there are any watch issues further down the road I will edit this review to reflect that.

"These Ekouaer thongs are SO soft and smooth to the touch.  They are mostly cotton (93%) with the rest being elastane.  They feel much softer than the cotton panties I find here in local stores.  You'll never want to take them off - the softness is amazing. They come in a three pack of the following colors: black, white, and grey.  The grey is pretty light in tone - almost a heather-textured type of grey. A great neutral color collection.  Colors are pretty subtle (minus the black) and don't show through pants. I ordered the size smalls and found them to be ""true to size"".  I am 5'4"" and weigh about 100 pounds.  They fit really well in all areas.  These thongs have enough stretch to them to really form to your individual body shape.  I really love the simplicity of these thongs.  Most thongs are so frilly and lacy and overall pretty uncomfortable so sometimes it is best to take it back a notch and go basic.  I would say these are practical thongs for every day wear!  These are kind of high cut so just be mindful of what you wear them with so they don't show out the top.  I probably wouldn't wear them with anything SUPER tight as the waist band is kind of thick and does have the brand logo across the top - it might show through so just do a quick double check before you leave your house.  I also love that they are TAGLESS so you don't have to worry about annoying tags poking out at the back of the thong above your butt!  You know what I'm talking about!  Husband gave his approval - he says my butt looks good in 'em.  Comfortable, basic, and sexy all in one.

"I was given a code for these in exchange to review the product. It is only fair that I be completely honest with my review.

I recently received these pair of bluetooth earphones. I was pretty excited because I don't have any earphones that are bluetooth so I couldn't wait to try them for a run. They came with a somewhat hard shell carrying pouch that appealed to me. It has a textured feeling on the outside so I was happy about that. It also had a little clip to clip them maybe to your belt loops or back pack or anything. They also came with a few ear pieces to switch out in different sizes. And it also came with a MicroUSB cord that is used for charging the device. The charging was pretty quick. I think it was fully charged within 1-2 hours. I wasn't actively paying attention, but for a product that small, I expected it to be pretty quick.

Pairing the device was a little tricky as there was only 3 buttons. A play, forward and backward button. I had to definitely read the instructions to figure out how I would pair the device.

After pairing, I was able to play music and watch videos. Playing music was fine. It sounded great. They're definitely not super high quality or anything, but they had a nice sound to them. I noticed that when pushing the button to advance to the next song, you could hear a pretty loud audible beep in the earphones. It scared me at first as it was louder than the music I was playing.

I proceeded to play a few videos and I noticed that the sync was off in the video to when I would hear it. The video seemed to be faster than the audio. At first, I assumed it was just the video, but then I played more videos and noticed it was happening to all of them. I then disconnected and went through and played them again and they were perfectly in sync. I would highly recommend avoiding these if having the audio sync with the video is an importance.

I made a phone call and used the earphone with them. I was able to hear perfectly fine with them. I asked the person who I called if they heard me fine and she stated she could hear me just perfectly. Again, after the call ended, it did give me a voice saying, ""Call Ended"".

The earphone buds them selves are in this weird holder type way. I assume it's to hold the earbuds in place while maybe exercising. After a long period of time using the earphones, they started to hurt my ears. I know most earphones give you some sort of discomfort after a while, but these made it a bit unbearable as not only did they bother the inside of my ears, but also where the extra plastic part where it holds on to your ear hurt as well.

Overrall, they sounded great to have just maybe in your backpack or laying around. They work great for calls and to listen to music. Otherwise, I would not use them for video.",1
Works better than I would have imagined. I use it for hiking and motorcycle trips while out in the deserts of SoCal. And I am amazed how quickly it will charge my Galaxy.,0
"These are definitely some of the most comfortable pajama pants I've ever owned  the ecofabric blend is incredibly soft but still seems fairly durable. My only gripes: a) the drawstring is absurdly long (seriously, I can wrap it around my waist twice and still tie it), although that's admittedly something that can be rectified with a pair of scissors; b) there's unnecessary plastic wrapping in the packaging, which bugs me since I sought them out for environmental reasons.

Also, worth noting that they run on the huge side  for reference, I'm 6'2"" and I had to send back a medium pair in exchange for a small.",0
"I love this tracker. I brought it to replace a smartwatch that I accidentally washed in the washing machine. It does almost everything my smartwatch did. It tracks my steps, miles and calories. It is very accurate too. The watch part is removable in order to charge it. I do wish that the company sold the bracelets separate as well in case someone would want to change the color or his/her watch. The first screen when you press the button on the watch gives you the time, the second click gives the numbers of steps for that day, The third gives the miles, and the last screen gives the amount of calories burned. The directions are in broken English (thats common with many products nowadays) but the app was easy to download and set up. Awesome inexpensive tracker.

"This shirt is so comfortable. I took note from past buyers and reviewers that the shirts sold by this company tend to run large and I odered a size down.

I like to carry my phone on my hip when working so was excited about this holster.  The phone fit snugly on the holster and slide in and out easily without being loose. The hosted rotated so you could position it wherever was most comfortable for you, but this is where this product fails.  While attempting to rotate the holster it cracked and broke right off after only 2 hours of use  I attempted to contact the seller several times and received no response .

"Grip's Wise Beam COB Pen Light is a super cool gadget to have around. I originally bought this light to help during storms and when my youngest is home alone.

Pros:
There are three great settings to the pen light. High beam, Low beam, and flashing security red.
The high beam is very bright! Almost blinding( sure to scare anyone away)
The low beam is perfect for storms and power outages.
The flashing red immediately made me think of emergency.
I like how this is hand held. It would be great for someone alone in a big city.
It is extremely easy to sure.
It does also alternate for a flash light so awesome for camping!
I really love all the creative used for Grip wide beam  COB Pen light!

Cons:
This is used specific. The high beam is very high. With that being sad it very well is doing what it should. I'm just very sensitive to light.

I recommend this for campers, hunting, fishing, emergency lighting for power outages, service workers, and anyone who would like more tools to feel safe.

"I love love love coffee and am always trying to find a way to get the best brew at home. However, this pot left me wanting a bit more....
PROS: The style of this coffee pot rally caught my eye and I enjoy the chic look and smooth lines (although it is large in size- but fits under my cabinets). When it is brewing it is actually quite quiet. It is fun to watch the water through the water tank then bubbling up the center before going into the coffee grounds and pot. There is also a ""wake up"" timer. This is always a plus for me as some mornings I am up extremely early and love to walk downstairs to the smell of a freshly brewed pot. It is easy to clean up.
CONS: It will use whatever amount of water you place into the water tank. For example if you want to brew 2-4 cups you have to only fill it to 2, 3, or 4 cups... versus other coffee makers I have used you can have a full water tank and it will only use what you tell it to. I personally like to have the water tank filled and then slowly use it (If I am only making a cup or two at a time). Another thing is it took some time to figure out how much coffee grounds to put in for a good cup of coffee. The scoop provided is a little large so I have reverted back to my own coffee ground scoop. About 2 cups on the coffee pot is 1 cup of coffee per the manual- however I find it close to a little over 1 cup when I brew 4 cups. My mugs are not that big. Maybe 14- ounces or so.
So overall, the coffeepot is fine. I am not as wowed by it is I had hoped or expected based on its advertising. Aside from its appearance, it does not seem to taste much different to me that other generally regular pots of coffee. I will make note that it uses a paper cone filter. I tend to find that coffee brewed through a paper cone filter tastes different to me than one brewed through a reusable mesh filter. That could be a product improvement for this coffeepot.

"Knowing that this is made overseas, you should purchase a size up.  We did and can't be happier.  The dress fits a 5'4"", size 14/16, large busted girl very well.  We bought the 2X and it fits across the chest and the waist seam is right where it is supposed to be...on the waist!  For a large chest, this is perfect.  It has princess seaming on the front to allow some generosity in the fit.
The fabric is a jersey crepe, but stretchy and has nice weight to it. I bought the dark blue and it is very true to the color: Royal blue.  Easy to dress up with some jewelry, a cardigan, whatever.  It is above the knees.
All in all, very happy with this purchase!

"My son and I were so stoked to get this single soap dispenser set for his bathroom. It makes so easy to just fill it with his shampoo and go about his business. I'm glad he hasn't been home so that I can figure out how to attach it to the wall in his bathroom. First, the chrome/silver is super shiny - love it. The pieces are easy to put together and take apart and use. The top of the plastic tube has a special key hole in it. There is an included key that fits inside of the hole perfectly that you turn in order to open and fill the container. Then it goes back on easily and you use the key again to lock it in place.

To dispense the shampoo (or soap or conditioner or body wash), just pull on the lever and it squirts out. Too easy. What the difficult part is, is figuring out how to attach it to our tile that my husband had applied. He flat out refused to screw it into the tile in my son's shower, or the tile in any of the other showers. Sigh. It is supposed to be attached with screws to where ever you want it. It comes with screws and screw holder things. You attach the backing to the wall first with the shiny side out, then the back of the dispenser has pegs that slide into the shiny backing. However, if you have beautiful tile that you don't want to drill in to, therein lies the issue. So, my husband has suggested that he go to the local hardware store to see if he can find something to attach it to the wall with - possibly some 3M sticky pieces, or some time of hard setting, waterproof adhesive. If not, it will turn in to a regular soap dispenser in the powder room - which is still pretty cool if you ask me. I'll keep you posted on how the alternative attachment goes this weekend.

"Great band for those looking for a silicone ring. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

Out of the bands that I have owned, this has subtle pattern all the way around the ring that give it a nice look.  As far as sizing goes, I am somewhere between 9.5 and 9.75 in ring size with a metal band. I ordered a size 9 in this band because I have experience slipping with other larger silicon band sizes. The size 9 worked out much better for me than a larger size.  It was definitely more comfortable to wear than a normal band.

"Writing this out of frustration. Spent extra for this coffee maker expecting a lasting product, but it keeps falling apart!
At around a year old, as others noted, the springs that hold the lid poked out of the hinge, and broke. I removed the springs, and was able to keep using it. The timer button just broke and fell off. Had to glue back together to be able to use... It's still brewing, but when it's time to replace it I won't trust Cuisinart. Poor quality at a high price. No thanks...",0
"So far I really like these cute earrings. I'm a park ranger and am always looking for minimalist jewelry that will not complement but not clash with the uniform, and these fit the bill. I wore these all day yesterday, and they stayed put nicely.

They are not typical stud earrings that have a back that goes straight into the ear - it is a longer back that fits along the lobe parallel to the earring itself. It is slightly more difficult to put on, but the design keeps the earring in place.

I wouldn't say this is a superb quality set of earrings, but more of a costume jewelry set. I don't think anyone would try to pass these off as real gold, but they are nevertheless very cute.

"As like most people, I have so many sunglasses because your always looking for the right pair. The Duduma Polarized Sport Mens Sunglasses are now my go to sun glasses. I am getting to the main feature that makes me like these so much, the design and shape. They are not a heavy pair if sunglasses. They are comfortable and conform to my head and don't cause any discomfort on my ears, the sides of the head or on my nose. I will say I have a wider head than most people and these flex enough to fir me well and not be tight. That to me is so important and why I wanted to mention this first. They also have soft rubber in the nose area and the end of the arms which keeps the glasses in place and which helps make them comfortable. Now to the main reason why we all wear sunglasses, to protect our eyes. The are polarized and protect filters out 100% of UVA , UVB , UVC and  harmful blue light up to 400nm. The clarity of these glasses is really good as you can see in my one photo. I feel what your looking at is actually clearer and sharper when these are on. I also like the design on the side of the arms, it makes the glasses look like a higher end pair. I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review. It in no way affected my opinion of the product or my review. I'm 54 years old and have tried so many sunglass types and brands, so know what to look for in sunglasses. These also come with a fabric carry bag, a hard case which I prefer and a cleaning cloth. These are comfortable, filter all the light because of how they fit and look good on. They give you a lifetime breakage guarantee, so that to me reflects in the quality of the glasses.",1

"Pros
 Training collar has 4 training modes: static shock/ vibration/ beep/ light, I have used the vibrations and the beep, I haven't used the shock, I am afraid I will hurt my dog.
The dog remote training collar is adjustable, my dog is lean so I was afraid it wouldnt feet her, and it fits just fine.
Since control range more than 300m it is great, because my dog has so much energy and can run really fast and far quickly
It is really light, so my dog wears all day and I just take it out when she goes to bed.

Cons
My dog destroyed and ate part of the toy in a few minutes
Setting was not strait, but if you follow the instructions it is ok.

"A high quality case for your phone.  I am really happy with my SlimTech iPhone 6 Leather Wallet Case.  I ordered the brown cover and am impressed with the stylish design and the rugged material which surrounds my phone with a protective cover.

This product allows you to detach the phone from the folio portion and carry it with the protective cover by easily pulling it apart and separating the magnets.  The folio contains 3 pockets in which you can carry identification and credit cards without your having to carry an additional wallet or purse.  I had no issues in placing my ID and credit cards in the pockets nor removing them. There is also a larger pocket for carrying cash or other larger items.  The folio and case easily fit over my iPhone 6S and looks very good.

Overall this is a very stylish and rugged case which has no manufacturing flaws I can tell and is stitch very well.  The interior material is soft and smooth and I have no fear that it will scratch the glass or cause any form of damage to the phone.

I did receive this product to try at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback. I do routinely provide feedback on products I try (paid or at discount) so that others may avoid some of the not so good choices on products they are looking for, and found that this product is very beneficial and performed as promised.

"These bags are beautiful and of exceptional quality!!! I ordered the blue set, which is a brilliant royal blue with a charcoal grey zipper and handle. They are generously spacious and easily fit my sneakers (Women's Size 9) with plenty of room to spare. Each zipper slides with ease and stays closed without any evidence of sliding out of place. Each handle is wide enough to fit your entire palm underneath it for easier carrying, and this handle can also be used to hang your bag in your locker or garment bag. The bags are made of nylon, and there is a water-protective coating on the inside surface of the nylon to protect your belongings. The craftsmanship is excellent, and there are no loose threads or seams on any of my bags. Each bag measures approximately 14.75"" L x 7.25"" W and can expand up to about 4.75"" D. Excellent product!! I would highly recommend these bags to others!!

"This does a good job of holding up my Ipad air tablet. It secures to my headrest and tightens down well. My only complaint is that it does move around a little bit (I have tried to tighten it the best I could get it). Considering the weight it is holding and the angle, I'm not too surprised by this. All in all, it was a nice cheap solution for giving my daughter something to watch on long road trips to visit family. I would recommend this brand to anyone when it comes to quality for your money.

It is a decent mount but does not have the tripod even though it comes with an adapter only. Some people have asked a video or directions on how to mount and the rep says it is easy. I spent more than 45 mins to figure out how I can have the phone and gopro go at the same time. In addition I was the phone adapter fits the goPro LCD but it does not and hence not versatile as I was hoping for. It does get the stability and good for taking videos or photos for short time. Anything more my arm and hand starts to shake as it gets heavy. The GoPro fits only with the waterproof case on. It is great for selfies. So I have to give only 4 stars.,0
"Very happy with this purchase! For when I work out/ work 12-hour shifts at the hospital, I like to wear a comfortable bra. I got 6 bras for what I normally pay for 1.

I'm small chested (32B) and these fit just fine; however, they are a little roomy. Definitely comfortable, and I think these would stretch to fit someone bigger than me.

My husband had bought me a pair for Christmas and I always had a problem with them. They would stop playing in the middle of a song and I would get so frustrated. I kinda gave up on the headsets. When I was given the opportunity to try these out, I figured why not. Well I'm very happy that I did. I haven't had any problems with these and I love using them. They come in handy when working out or just cleaning my house. I can listen to music and not interrupt anyone who's watching TV. They are very comfortable around the neck and in my ear. They come in several colors like black, blue, gold, pink, red and white. They come with a USB charging cord and user manual. You get up to 15 hours of talk time and 8 hours of music. You can connect 2 devices at the same time and have connection stability within 10 meters. My daughter already wants to claim them so it looks like I'll be needing another set.

"The iKross Universal Magnetic Smartphone Dashboard Mount Holder For iPhone 6s Plus 6s SE, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge S6 Edge Note 5, LG G5 phone mount is awesome.
I always lay my phone in my cup holder or by my leg when I get into the car and put the phone on charge. But usually I am digging for my phone because it ends up falling into the floor board.

The iKross phone mount is great for this very reason. My phone stays put and I can turn it anyway that I need to. The magnet on the phone mount is super strong I was very impressed with just how strong that little magnet is.

I installed the phone mount in seconds and immediately used it with my phone attached. Never the first time has it shown any signs of trying to fall off.
I also noticed that since you can turn it to any angle that when my husband was riding with me I put his phone on it and turned the mount towards him and he used it.

The most important thing that I noticed was that it keeps my phone out of the sun and away from the heat. My phone heats up very easily and I try to make sure that my phone is kept cool and away from the heat.

With the iKross phone mount it is easy to keep my phone cool and I must add about how light weight that this mount is. The mount is very light but made to last. I was given this phone mount at no charge/free to try it out and test it in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion/review of the iKross universal magnetic smartphone phone mount.",1

"This is a 5 star case for what it is, a cellphone/wallet combo. However, as a general iPhone case, I'd say it's a 4 star.

Pros:
- The magnetic removable case is GREAT. One of the reasons I don't like wallet cases is that the phone is stuck to the case, making the phone harder to use and heavier to move around (if I'm at home, I don't need to carry around my wallet).
- The case is easy to put on and remove.
- The wallet is sufficient as a ""wallet. There is 1 ID slot + 2 card slots. The zippered compartment splits into a few compartments and has lots of room for cash, cards, and change. The wallet is also not huge, so that's a plus. There a wristlet cord that comes with the wallet which is also useful.

Cons:
- The case is not super protective. There's no lip, so if the phone falls face-first, you're in trouble. I did put a tempered glass cover on and hopefully that helps (this case will be compatible with most tempered glass covers). The back magnet part isn't bad and should provide protection to the back of the phone. Not sure about how bumper-y the bumper is. The buttons and cut-outs are all fine.
- The construction is fine, though not top notch. I still had some whisps of glue on my phone case. Though the wallet part itself actually looks pretty good (nice faux textured pleather). The case slots stuck a little the first time I tried to use them.

Overall, if I wanted a wallet cell phone case, I'd use this one. If I wanted a really protective iPhone case, I'd look elsewhere (I'm a fan of Lifeproof for waterproof, everything proof case).

At first I thought they might require attachment after-the-fact, but there is nothing in the box that could contain them so their were either left off after manufacturing or left out of the box. Either way, I wanted to include that here because the product description notes them being here. Now this has not harmed the sturdiness of the product, but I did add legs because I do not want this scratching any of my furnishings.

When it comes to headphones, I practically live in a pair. I mean, between gaming and music, I pretty much wear headphones like some sort of a second skin. Whether I am outside hiking or kayaking, visiting relatives for holiday, or working (on any day I can), I wear headphones and remain plugged in because this is literally bringing a soundtrack for living with you. I love that, too, and with that, I love the gear that delivers that to me and try to take care of it.

Now, I know a lot of people that simply throw their headphones down after listening to them or place their headsets on their desk and go about their business, and I never understood that. You end up aging the cushioning, screwing with fit, and much more when you sit them down, plus they are flush with whatever item and could have something crawl into them (which is an idea I find horrific). That is why something like this is important, because it extends the lifespan of the headphones, gives them good support, keeps up with them, and this design looks good while doing so.

When it comes to this design, it is relatively straight-forward, with a large base, an extension, and a perch for your headphones to sit astride. This comes in three pieces (with a screw comprising a fourth), and it all fits together simply and easily. To assemble, all you have to do is tighten the extension by screwing it into the perch, then you screw the base to the extension. It takes all of a minute to put together, and the solidity that it presents is actually very impressive. To test that, I tried bending it to see if the screw would give out, but it is solid - and feels that way.

As far as aesthetics and design, the sheen of aluminium is nice because it does not have the gloss of a cheaper metal. That means it can look good without reflecting so much, which in turn makes it a compliment and not a distraction.  The design compliments a lot of setups, too, from the classic desk approach to more minimal and future styles. Now, with design, there is not a lot here to discuss IN A GOOD WAY, which means there is not a lot to give out. You have a design made from a material that is not going to rust or deteriorate over time, it is thick enough to hold up AND to house most types of headphones without stability issues (11.5""), and the perch has a nice area designed for housing your headphones. I like the way this area is designed because the rubberized grip keeps your headphones from being damaged and it keeps them in place, thereby preserving the cushioned interior most headphones have.

This is a really solid model and I like it a LOT.",1
"I like this selfie stick as it is very compact, light weighted, fits smart phones up to 3.26'' (83mm) in width and is long - 31.5''. I use it with my Samsung S6 and tried with iphone 4S. Both phones worked great with this selfie stick. The best part of it - no batteries to charge and no pairing is needed, like with other, Bluetooth driven selfie sticks. It is plug and play ready - you connect cable to AUX input of your phone and you can make selfies right away. The selfie stick is quality made form good materials. I am satisfied with this purchase.

"It was so nice to see this pug ring in a dark finish! I have 2 pugs, one fawn and one black, and there is definitely more out there to choose from with the fawn pugs. This ring is comfortable to wear, though a little bit on the smaller side. I can wear it on my ring finger pretty comfortably. I was very impressed with the detail, though! From the precise face wrinkles, to the fur, to the curly tail, the detail is exquisite! It has a nice shine to it and it looks pretty cool when it is on. It's like my pug is giving me a hug whenever he's not with me, haha! I have washed my hands, played in pool water and wore it through regular daily duties and it has held up beautifully! No discoloration, scratches or anything. It doesn't leave any marks or discoloration on my finger either. It is a very good quality and I would definitely recommend this ring to anyone who either owns a pug or just loves the breed. It is adorable and you are sure to get many compliments!

"I purchased this leash because I have an 8-month old cavalier who doesn't want to behave that well on a leash and keeps pulling. This leash arrived promptly and in easy to open packaging. The leash feels sturdy and appears well-constructed out of heavy nylon leash material. The elastic is springy.

I was pleased to see that the waist belt can be detached and the end of the leash has a handle loop so you can use it as a regular leash. There is also a loop near the dog's collar in case you need to pull him back and hold him. The stitching is reflective, so it would definitely be a help for those who like to walk in the evening, as I do. (It doesn't ""glow,"" it reflects light.)

I can see the benefit in having the belt, especially if you like to run with weights or walk with children/strollers. I don't do either of those two things, and I personally preferred using the leash without the belt. This leash is 6' and so it is long enough to use with a smaller dog. When I first saw the leash, I was concerned that it was too thick, but it worked just fine for my dog, and fit comfortably in my hand. The thing that's really great about this leash is that the bungee provides some ""give"" to the leash so it doesn't ""yank"" on the dog's neck, but the dog does still feel some resistance when they pull on it, so it encourages them to stay close without yanking on their neck -- a more gentle type of correction. The hardware on the leash also appears to be heavy-duty. Overall I think this is a leash I'm going to enjoy using, and which will withstand regular use for many years to come. I am for ever thankful for such great inventions. I absolutely love my new belt and leash for my pup. My pup she is such a good pup normally she will just jog along with me while I jog and never leaves my side. That happens to change when I bring my little ones along with me as well while they ride their bikes. Butter my Bulldog is protective over my munchkin's so while they are riding and I am jogging slightly behind them Butter wants to be right along their side just in case of cars and/or people. With the 3 of my little ones riding there's no room for Butter to jog along side of them. That's when my belt and leash come in extremely handy, Butter stays right with me joggong nicely behind my little ones. The belt is super easy to put on and with just a clip of the leash to Butters cola we ate ready to rock and roll. I also like that I am able to unclipped the leash at the top where it attaches to the belt and use the leash just as a leash when I want too. I am also able to allow my oldest daughter to hold the leash while it's just her riding and me jogging. We are able to go back and forth with no problem and Butter absolutely loves it. Our rides and jogs aren't to far because our Butter Ball Bulldog isn't in for long distance's she just loves her every other day strolls. Just enough to stay healthy!

Update - I tried the leash with the waist strap. It worked fine, but I would suggest to the manufacturer that they may want to make the waist strap larger - I had to put it at its largest and it was a tight fit and while I carry a few extra pounds and am a large-framed person, I am not obese by any stretch.

"This is a very pretty pillowcase if you're looking to update your current throw pillows. The ME.FAN pillowcase is very well made and sewn from a thick canvas like material.  The back of the pillowcase is beige and only one side has the design.  There is a very strong, yet discreet zipper in the bottom of the case so it's easy to slip onto another pillow. I think it measures about 18"" square. The design itself is very beautiful, almost like a Van Gogh painting.  The blue background is vibrant and pigmented and you can see the texture lines in it, just like you would a painting. The only thing I'm disappointed about is that there is no actual texture to the pillow.  From the pictures it looks as if the petals would be deminsional and that there would be a bit of texture in the background. I think if it were textured, it would add just the right touch.

"I am a manager for a pediatric practice, and it gets so hot in the office. It is only the beginning of summer, and we are already in the 100s here in Southern California. I was looking for a fan that I could put in the medical assistants station that wasn't too large or too loud. When I came across this USB fan, I thought that it was really compact and that it would work perfect in the office. I placed the order and this was shipped to me quickly. This is great. This comes with the needed USB cord. I plugged this into the computer in the office, selected the speed that I wanted, and this works perfect. I like that this does not have any open fan blade, and I appreciate that this is not too loud to operate. It puts off much better wind than I thought it would. For the price, this is a great little fan to have, and it is so portable, that the girls can move it from one desk to another if theyd like.

"The dress was just put into a plastic bag, and when I opened I saw it was definitely going to fit way too big (order a size down, maybe 2 if you want a ""tight, fitted"" look). It was a somewhat thin material, similar to a nightgown. Or club wear type dress, but doesn't have the club wear look once it's on. However, that being said, it is very comfy (definitely wear in warmer weather). I tried it on and it just wasn't my thing (too long for me, but that's my fault for not paying attention to all of the ad, which said it was mid calf length), but I may be able to make it work with a blazer and wear to work or for a meeting, something conservative. So yes, ladies, it is a good wear to work dress and maybe even a from office to happy hour type dress. I may give them a try again and order a size or 2 down.
I am glad I had the chance to buy and review, and do not regret the purchase, just not as excited as I thought I would be.

"These are perfect for all levels of golfers. The tees are long enough for all heights and have wording down the side to make it known how far you have pushed it into the ground.

"I wasn't sure our dogs would like the taste of this since they haven't really had fish oil or similar supplements yet. For their first couple doses I cut the amount in half and simply offered it to them on a spoon. They eagerly licked it up and wanted more. Now I typically mix it in with their food and they honestly seem to prefer Omegease to be added to their food. They don't eat as eagerly during feedings where I don't include fish oil so I'm confident it tastes good to them.

I can't comment on the long term effects of the supplement because I haven't been using it long enough. One of our dog's has coarser fur and a dull coat so we're hoping this will help. I haven't noticed any side effects and our dog's seem more active since I've been adding this supplement to their diet.

PROS:
+ Affordable
+ A good value. You get a lot of product for the money
+ Our dogs seem to enjoy the taste
+ The pump dispenser is easy to use
+ Easy to mix in with food

CONS:
Most of my complaints about this product center on packaging and smell.
-  Smell: I've smelled much stronger fish oil supplements in both pet and human consumption varieties. That being said, this stuff still has a strong fishy odor. The product listing and description may claim this supplement is free of strong fishy odors. That's a bit misleading in my opinion. It may not smell AS strong as other fish oil supplements but it does indeed have a very fishy odor. You will smell this when you put it on your pet's food. Rest assured your pet does too. The good news is our dogs go crazy over the smell and taste. The aroma does linger on pet fur so if they're a messy eater your pet's face may smell fishy for quite a while after eating. This stuff smells if you get it on your hands too. I find I have to wash my hands multiple times to get the odor to go away once I get it on my skin. It's entirely possible I'm more sensitive than others to the smell as well. You don't smell this across the room but it does have a fish odor that I suppose can't be avoided.

- Packaging: The plastic bottle I received was a little crushed but was otherwise intact. The seller does send multiple emails asking you to inspect the bottle for shipping damage and to inform them immediately of any issues. The pump dispenser works great. The problem is the bottle is a bit overfilled and there isn't enough space for the pump dispenser to be installed without some fish oil being displaced to make room. This isn't a problem if you know things ahead of time. I'd HIGHLY recommend taking a look into the bottle and pouring some fish oil out into a separate container before installing the pump dispenser if need be. At the very least sloooowly insert the pump dispenser and watch to see if the level rises close to the top of the bottle while doing so.  If you simply unscrew the cap and stick the pump dispenser on the bottle (like I did) you may cause a bunch of smelly fish oil to spill out all over the outside of the bottle, your hands, the table and more.

- Leaks: If you aren't careful the fish oil easily works its way around the threaded portions of the lid and bottle dispenser. If you knock the bottle over, tip it to far, jostle it etc. fish oil will seep out around the cap and run down the outside of the bottle. There are also times where the pump dispenser drips. If you aren't careful it can be a messy and smelly ordeal.

The seller has recommending tapping the bottle etc. to ensure any fish oil remaining in the pump tip after dispensing comes out. This does seem to help with avoiding any surprise drips later on. Just ensure you're careful when handling the bottle otherwise and you should be fine.

_____________
CONCLUSION:
Overall this seems to be a quality fish oil. Our dogs love the taste. The smell and bottle design might be a nuisance to some..  Despite claims to the contrary, this stuff does smell fishy. That's  unfortunate because if you aren't careful the bottle has a tendency to leak fish oil all over. I'd recommend this product to anyone that wants a high quality and affordable fish oil supplement for their pets. If you don't like fishy smelling fish oil (good luck finding one that doesn't have SOME odor) or if you're afraid to wipe up the occasional mess, this might not be for you. Otherwise I say give it a try because our pets love it.

"I love it! These are comfortable, and they stay on even during a run. You'll definitely stand out with these pants. I purchased the purple to turquoise ombre, and I'm very pleased. The color transition is smooth, and though it's a stand out color, it's not obnoxiously loud. The fit is almost skin tight, but the material is thick, so no need to worry about transparency. I'm 5'1 and I weigh 118, and the S/M size fit perfectly. More importantly, it doesn't give me a camel-toe. I'l definitely be purchasing other colors!

"I received this product at half off, in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I think it's pretty clever, not only for keeping junk like toothpaste tubes and toothbrushes up off of the bathroom sink and counter, but for squeezing every bit out of the toothpaste tube. It's very easy to attach to the wall, too...just use the adhesive foam tape to stick it on to the wall. I've used these tapes for putting up many things and they really are surprisingly strong. In fact, most of them are still stuck just where I first put them, the adhesive is just so strong and sticky. This is a real simple and easy to gadget, just screw your tube of toothpaste into the dispensing unit and close the cover. Once it's attached back up on the wall, it's ready to use. You just use your toothbrush to push the lever back, this will make it squeeze out some toothpaste on to your brush. There's also a toothbrush holder with room for up to 5 toothbrushes. You can choose from 3 different colors: Blue, Black or Pink. This is especially nice for families with kids, it could even make brushing teeth kind of fun.",1
"Love this ring stand!  Very secure fit, doesn't feel like it's going to come off unless I force it.  I can apply it wherever I want on my case instead of relying on how it's mounted by the manufacturer.

The ring itself is stiff enough to stay in position while you're using it one-handed, but it moves easy enough to position it differently depending on how you're sitting, standing, lying or holding your phone.  It's also relatively slim and lightweight so as not to add a lot of bulk to your case.

The holder/stand that comes with it is a thoughtful addition as well.  You can mount it on a desk, table, or other smooth or semi smooth surface and stick the ring into the slot to hold your phone in place.  It would be a perfect holder for a desk if you have no problem using the adhesive to mount it.

I haven't tried to remove the ring holder or the mount, but the instructions say it can be removed carefully and reapplied if you keep it clean, or rinse it off it becomes dirty.

I'm planning to get extras to use with my (many) other cases, so that I can use my phone one handed without fear of dropping it.  This is an easy five star item.

"This is perfect for naughty dogs.  I have a Doberman and a rat terrier. Guess which one is the naughty one?  The rat terrier. The Dobie is just happy to go for a walk, the rat terrier turns into the Tasmanian Devil when he goes for a walk:  every smell or sight makes him go nuts.

Thus, I don't usually take him. OR, worse, my husband takes him off leash.  I don't want him hit as I kind of like the brat.

So I tried out this leash.  I'm not sure if this is a new invention or what, but the clip on this is different as it swivels completely so I'm not tangled up in it.  Really! My old one did not have that.  This means he can do somersaults if he wants and the leash doesn't get tangled up.  And he does do somersaults over especially good smells.

The length is perfect at 6' long, because then he and the Dobie can keep some space from each other (she acts like she doesn't know him when we walk, as he is embarrassing).  The handle is the same nylon material that is stiff but comfortable. It's wide enough that it doesn't pinch your hands.

It's double reinforced at clip and handle, and the clip is easy to put on when the dog is jumping around with excitement at getting to go for a walk.

Funny story:  the dogs know my walking shoes.  If I walk outside, they usually don't acknowledge me, but if they see my walking shoes, they instantly get excited.  Smarter than me, I guess!

"My daughter is OBSESSED with these boots. I ordered her the denim color in a size 5 and they fit perfectly. In fact, when they arrived at the house, she unwrapped the box and tried them on immediately when her friend was over. They each took a boot and were running around the house in them and didn't want to take them off  even though it was 92 degrees out. Needless to say, her friend asked me to text the link to the boots to her mother so she could get a pair too. The denim is a dark blue/navy color and looks great with anything. Shes tried them on with leggings and tall socks peaking out over the top, skinny jeans and with a skirt and taller socks  all looked absolutely adorable. There are days when she beats me home from day camp and needs to let herself into the house and the little pockets are perfect for her house key and other miscellaneous things 12 year olds find necessary (ha!). I did have a concern when I read some reviews and saw that people were complaining that the zipper got stuck. Thats the last thing I need if my daughter got home before I did and had no way of letting herself in the house! So when they arrived, I took a look and noticed that there is a clear stitch across the zipper to prevent it from going all the way down (see the photo below)  it is NOT defective or a manufacturing error. They still open far enough to get your belongings in and out. These are seriously so adorable! Youll love them!

"These Denali hiking poles are exactly as described/ no frills. As soon as they arrived, I adjusted them to my liking and I'm 5'6. I actually bought them for my 11-year old son that does long hikes with scouts. We usually go 3 miles or so but he's gone 15 miles or so and has asked for poles. They adjusted perfectly for him. They are lightweight and sturdy. They telescope so they are extra sturdy if you're a little shorter than average. The handles are comfortable with a wrist strap to keep ahold of them. The pole tips are constructed to navigate through different terrain. We've only used them on local hikes but they will come in handy for the longer ones for sure. I love the color, too!

All of us free Spotify listeners know you only get a limited amount of song skips, so I again reverted back to the instructions and noted that to turn the volume either up or down, you have to HOLD the button for 5 seconds and then your volume changes (and not the song).  So my advice to those of you reading is to definitely read all of the instructions first beforehand.

I am used to using Sennheiser earbuds which are amazing, however, they are at least triple the cost, if not more, than the Audiobomb.  I was amazed that I really enjoyed the quality of sound coming from these little headphones, and for a fraction of the price. The highs are crisp, the mid range is just okay to me and the bass is adequate for the type of music I listen to which is mostly 70's rock and current top hits.

They fit comfortably on my head.  The ear pieces are not really snug, however, I am female and I would imagine that there would be a more snug, noise canceling fit for a man.  The headset itself has hinges and is collapsible as shown in the picture I've provided.  They are lightweight and I have not used them enough to comment on their durability.

I happened to receive a call while listening to my music and I could hear the caller just fine and when I asked, they could also hear me well too, so I was happy with the quality of the call.  So all that being said, I feel that for the price you will definitely be happy with your purchase.  I have received this item at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.",1

"I was so thrilled with how gorgeous this pendant necklace is! From the front you get a gorgeous pink stone. If you look closely at the bottom, there are silver flowers holding the stone. Turn the pendant over and you're in for a real surprise! The beautiful flowers all over the back are shiny and stunning!

Likes
+ gorgeous
+ pink stone is very shiny and beautiful
+ such beautiful silver rose details
+ nice chain length and clasp

Dislikes
- the stone is a little larger than necessary for me

This is truly a special piece of jewelry. I thought it was beautiful when I first saw the shiny silver against the pale pink stone. When I looked closely and turned it over, I was blown away! It is gorgeous! The entire back is filled with beautiful flower shapes in a shiny polished silver against the stunning pink stone.

This is a gorgeous necklace with what appears to be a strong chain and clasp. It arrived in a nice drawstring bag and would make an excellent gift. I can't say enough about the beautiful detail.

I received this product for testing purposes. I was asked to be honest in my review - good or bad - to help future buyers. I have no affiliation with the company, did not receive compensation, and all opinions come from my own experience with the product.",1

Why don't I buy some expensive After instead? Well my dear friend, if you are about to choose an expensive pair of sunglasses over this one just because of the brand, you are about to screw up. I mean yes, True is not such a famous company, but let me tell you that it does not affect the quality of their products.
I have been using these sunglasses for three weeks, while skateboarding, and walking during sunny days and these are some of the reasons why I think this item deserves 5 stars:

+ Customer service representatives? Extremely responsible and diligent.
+ The shipping process was very quick and smooth.
+ It comes in an eco-friendly, recyclable cardboard box.
+ It comes with a discount code that can be applied to another TRUE product.
+ The lens are polarized and offer 100% UVA/UVB protection, so your eyes will be protected from harmful rays.
+ A cleaning cloth is included, so you can keep the lens clear without scratching while cleaning them with your hands.
+ It comes with two carry cases: a soft one, which makes it easier to carry them in your pocket, and a hard one, for those who like putting the sunglasses in their backpacks, so it will not get damaged.
+ All the accessories are True-labeled, which means that you are not getting a generic product.
+ The arms seem to be very resistant and have never provoke me a headache. They have never fallen off my face while I am skateboarding.
+ A 1 year warranty is offered by the seller, so do not worry about wasting your money if you do not like them.
+ The hinges are made of stainless steel, which means that it will last as much as you want, because it is anti-corrosive.
+ The lens look really cool. They have a mirror effect which does not let others know what you are looking at (I guess that's a pro, isn't it?).
+ They are very lightweight, and its corners and edges are rounded off, so it is somewhat relaxing to touch them.
+ They are FDA approved! I mean that is amazing, the lens are certified as safe ones for humans, by a governmental agency.

"I love this Mobility Hard Case Cover for MacBook! I ordered the grey one so it blends in nicely with my computer since I use my laptop for business I didn't want anything that was flashy or stood out. This blends perfectly and you can still see the apple sign light up when the laptop is open. The bottom part has vents so it will not overheat the computer. The product is durable, yet it is not bulky and will definitely protect my computer from dings/scratches. The case snapped on super easy and is easy to get back off. The packaging is great to prevent damage while shipping, and shipping was really quick as well. I really like this case and will be ordering another one for my husband's laptop!

This purse is so convenient. It is cute and the color matches many outfits. It has two pockets that are deep inside. Personally I use one pocket for my cell phone and the other pocket for my money and cards that I need. This item is secure and it would be difficult to steal because the strap goes over your body. The strap is wide and it would be hard to rip off your body. I received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.,1

"my second samsung... loved the first one...  this one not so much... the picture is sometimes jumpy,  the remote didn't work out of the box.  finally the thing shut off.. after about 6 months... Kudo's to the service people though.. They came right out and fixed the TV and its been working ever since. except for the remote.  I'm still waiting for them to fix that.  The online stuff you have to go through to get a service tech is a pain.",0
"Ive been waiting to get a watch holder for the longest time because Im an avid watch collector. I love that this has 2 layers so it doesnt take up a lot of room on my dresser but I can still display my watches. It can hold up to 20 watches or you can take out the pillow and place other things in the compartments such as rings or bracelets. The top lid does open nicely and has a nice hinge as you can see in my picture. It comes with a key and a micro fiber cloth to clean the glass I don't know why these cases come with keys because it seems pointless, it reminds me of those keys that would lock you diary when you were 10 years old. If someone was going to rob you theyd just take this whole case.

The cushions in this box are too big for my watches though, Im a female and my wrist is small so after I have my watches adjusted they NEVER fit the pillow that it came with ..only if I don't latch the closure. So I cant take a star off for that but I did take a star off because the quality seems to be slightly off. As you can see in my picture the stitching isn't consistent and is off in some places and Im scared to cut the lose loop. Also, the bottom drawer doesnt slide out as smoothly as I wish but yah thats why I took off one star. Other than that I think it looks great and no one can really point out these inconsistencies unless they are looking for them which I was!

"I wanted a ring that will last forever and look good, and this ring definitely meets the requirements. There are a couple important things to remember when ordering tungsten. First, tungsten cannot be resized. I guess it would be impossible to resize this ring anyway since it is ornate, but it cant be done with their other styles as well. Second, You should not wear this ring while working if there is a risk of finger injury. They will be unable to cut this ring off, and it may cause additional injuries. Finally, Tungsten is usually sold a half size oversized. This is primarily due to the hardness and the risks involved if your finger swells up, but it is something to consider.

The tooling on the internal decorations is very good, especially considering the level of detail involved. I would say this ring makes a great gift or personal buy.

"My husband and I have different brands of cell phones, but they both use the same type of charging cable.  We have tried many different replacement cables.  Some will work great with my husbands phone, and won't work on mine and vise versa.  This cable is definitely the best replacement cable that I have ever bought.  It plugs in securely, the cable is very thick, it works on both of our phones and the best part was the charging speed.  With our other cables, it seemed to take several hours to even get a half charge.  I plugged my phone using this cord to charge it, it was in the red, I checked it after about 30 min and it was charged to half!!!  I am extremely happy with this product and would definitely purchase it again!

"I was so excited about trying the Fetoo invisible bra (B, Pure Nude).
It did ship really fast and I received before I was expecting!
I love it! It really sticks to your skin as they say it would, edge of each bra piece also contains a small clip that allows you to pull them together and give you cleavage, and do not worry about your nipples, the part that supposed to cover it doesnt have the sticky silicon! Seems that it is really made of high-quality silicone material '
It also comes in a nice case so you can keep it safe from dust, hair or anything else that can get on the sticky silicon and to clean you can just pass under warm water and hang it to dry.
Overall, I am quite happy with these bras and I would recommend to any of my friends that would need a little ""support""!!

"I almost always find a need for a new flashlight every now and again. I wanted one that is rechargeable without removing the battery. I liked that this flashlight has a lantern mode that is dimmable. I camp a lot in the summer and that feature will be used a lot. The main flashlight has three modes but I'm not a huge fan of the strobe. It feels plenty sturdy and had seals to be water resistant. It charges with a micro USB lead but I'm not 100% sure it is able to charge with a normal USB charger as the included one outputs 4.2v to be safe I will be only using the included charger with it. It uses a standard 18650 3.7v lithium ion cell so it will be easy to replace in the future.

I don't like that the beam isn't adjustable, you just get a bright spot and an area of illumination around it.

"This is a cute little lunch box. It is very comparable to other expensive bento box brands.  This is nice because it is leakproof and easy to transport.  I like the little window on the top so you can see what's inside.  This works for items that don't need to be heated up like salads or sandwiches.  I did test this with liquid, I help it upside down and shook it around and no leaks.  When I unhooked the latches a little water got on my hand, so make sure to have a napkin ready in case there is a little leakage when opening.

I really like this bag because it's light and small BUT...the shoulder strap cushion ripped on one side and the form is exposed after ~2 week of uses...I contacted their CS and they express their apologize and know this is a manufacturing issue. They offer me a refund to get fix but unfortunately, I don't have the time. I guess I'll be using this until I do or it breaks. Like I said I like this bag...

This is my review of the Zikee laptop sleeve messenger shoulder bag 15 inch.

Disclaimer: I received this free for testing and evaluation in exchange for my full, honest and unbiased review. My review are of my own opinion. I was not compensated for this review. Zikee didn't review this before posting.

This is a very sleek and slim bag. It will fit a thin (ultrabook) type laptop. If you have a thick older laptop it will probably take up a lot of spaces.

The material is smooth polyester type not fabric as the photo might have make it look like for those like me...I have a Jack Spade leather shoulder bag. It was heavy and wide. It held a lot of stuff (I work at IT and have a lot of gear...). I have an Amazon
AmazonBasics Universal Travel Case for Small Electronics and Accessories and USB Flash Drive Case / Hard Drive Case Lensfo Universial Portable Waterproof Shockproof Electronic Accessories Organizer Holder so you can imagine how big my bag can get. Well this bag can't fit all of them only my Shockproof USB drive holder.

Overall: This bag has some pros and cons. The benefits is that it's slim and light weight. The not so good is the width of the bag won't hold much or else it look blown up. I like it because it's light weight. I can lug around more. The shoulder strap is a bit slippery though and fell off my should couple of time. My Jack Spade does it as well and the strap and hard fabric. This is not bad for the price and if you're just on a quick and ready to type of person then this would be fair enough. If you need space for a lot of equipment then probably not. I'm in between.",1
"I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I picked up this automatic soap dispenser because first, I have an addiction to expensive, uppity-brand, sweet-smelling soaps. We have a flock of chickens, and the last thing I want to do is come in to wash my hands (which are usually covered in chicken poop, if not mud, feathers, and dog slobber, since we also have a few Great Pyrenees) and get gunk all over my soap dispenser(s), thus needing to clean it after I've washed my hands. Enter this little beauty. I like that it's adjustable, but there really only seems to be two amount settings: tiny dollop, or medium sized dollop. I've pushed the buttons numerous times, and every time, either the tiny or the medium amount comes out. There seems to be no real difference in the other settings. But, it dispenses soap with just a wave of a hand, and I can wave my hand under it a couple of times to get a good solid amount when I really need it, so I'm good. It holds about two bottles of regular sized hand soap, and about a bottle and a half of those expensive (non-exfoliating/beaded) soaps from places like Bath & Bodyworks. Word of warning: do not put those soaps with the scrubby bead things in this -- it will gunk up the dispenser. Other than that, it does exactly what I need it to do!",1

"This watch is just the right size and weight. Also, it's comfortable and looks very nice. The band is made out of a silicone/rubber material, the back is stainless steal and the face is plastic so it shouldn't break easily. The face is a nice size, with a clear dial so it's easy to read. It also has a backlight to use in darker areas. It has two buttons on the left which operate the light and the function mode. The two buttons on the right operate the start/stop and the digital adjust key. When setting the watch make sure it's in normal mode before adjusting. To set the time press key 4 (Digital adjust key) once for the date, repress for week, then press button 2 (function mode) for back to normal. To set alarm clock press button 2 twice, then button 3 to set time and button 4 to go back to normal. With the light button just choose your right setting and release. That's mainly all the steps needed to set watch and be ready to wear every day.
The O.T.S. watch is waterproof up to 50 meters so if it accidently gets wet there's no problems with it not functioning.
I was really impressed with the packaging. It came in a nice see through box (with instructions) so it will be perfect for a gift.
Pros
Lightweight
Comfortable
waterproof
Nice size dial
Cons
None

"I always tried to buy the XL version of the kodak cartridges when I needed to replace my ink. However, the store usually ran out and when they did have them in stock, they were so much more money. These cartridges are a great replacement option. They work just fine in the printer. The chip is accepted immediately and there were no issues with the printer recognizing that this was a new cartridge. So far, in terms of capacity, these have held up very well. I did a ton of printing towards the end of the school year. I have to print letters to parents, kids documents and projects from their school laptops, etc. I still have not run out of the color cartridge yet. And when I do, I will have a seance set to replace it. The ink looks great and the colors are true to what they look like eon the screen prior to printing. The ink dried just a quickly as authentic kodak ink and it was crisp and colors were rich.  I was provided with this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.

"Excellent little camera for many reasons... For any comparisons in this review to my GoPro - the model I own is a GoPro HERO. This version is the base level GoPro without a screen and capable of 1080p @ 30fps and 720p @ 60fps. At the time, it was purchased for around $130.

From the start, I was impressed by the value of this camera for everything yet get compared to the GoPro. There is a difference in manufacturing quality.. However, based on features alone - getting a GoPro with an LCD as well as the accessories included would set you back several hundred dollars, even with off-brand accessories.

The form factor of the camera is, as you might expect, very similar to the GoPro in many ways. Familiar shape, lens in the same spot, little rectangular batteries, etc. Overall the build quality isn't bad and much better than I expected for a camera at this price point. The video quality is quite excellent. I did a bit of research based on the firmware version of the camera. This unit actually appears to be using a Sony sensor module. I cannot confirm this without breaking my camera, but it actually makes sense since these components are difficult to manufacture and there are only a handful of companies that actual do. This explains the video quality and also why off-brand cameras may still perform almost as well as higher-end versions.

One pet peeve of mine has always been when a device has a menu with horribly broken or badly translated English. This instantly lowers the value of the item offers a constant reminder of how cheap the item is. I had a dash-cam once where the menu option for video settings"" was something along the lines of ""ensure video arrangement""... For such an inexpensive unit, I was quite impressed with the menu on this camera. There are an abundance of options, and all appear to be worded correctly and ordered logically. The only thing I would do without is the splash screen when you turn the camera on and off. There is a badly-compressed image that says ""welcome"" and ""goodbye"". Simply omitting these images would increase the perceived value of the camera very quickly.

One feature that I really like is the ""Car Mode"". This allows you to mount the camera on your windshield and the camera will automatically turn on and begin recording as soon as USB power is applied (ignition turned on in most cars). The camera will also stop recording a few seconds after the USB power is turned off. This makes for a nice dash-cam with excellent quality video. There is also an option for ""Cyclic Recording"" that loops the recording so you don't have to worry about running out of space on your MicroSD card.

There are a few extra features I wouldn't normally expect such as face/smile detection however I haven't had a chance to look further into those yet (and likely won't have a use for them).

I'm not going to get into the included accessories - you can take a look a the product photos to get a good understanding of what's included. They are of average quality for third-party action camera accessories. The tolerances aren't going to be as good as expensive GoPro branded accessories, but my wallet doesn't mind it as much.

The waterproof enclosure does seem to work quite well as I didn't have any issues with submerging the camera during testing. I considered uploading a video however Amazon compresses the quality so much that it would be doing the camera a disservice. There are a couple good screen grabs that another reviewer has uploaded to show the quality.

If this camera was $100-150+, I might deduct a star for the cheap splash screen images, or lower tolerances on the accessories... but for the price this is easily a five star camera. It's very hard to be disappointed with the value that you receive.

"I got this for my girlfriend since we both enjoy snorkeling and being active withouth having to worry about the hassle of changing normal breathing patterns. This product is amazing. Have tested it out multiple times now in the ocean as well as pools, and haven't had a single issue yet. It is easy to fit correctly, forms a great seal, and the breathing apparatus is flawless. You are able to dive down under water and no water will come into the breathing tube at all!

Fogging has never happened because of the separate breathing area and this is truly a great product for amateur and experienced snorkelers alike. Additionally, there is a an attachment for a gopro or other action camera that works perfectly. (We don't have a gopro, we have another camera and there was not an issue with attachment) Would highly recommend for anyone looking to be able to enjoy their snorkeling experience.

"I bought these pet relief, ear relief drops, for my dog. He gets ear infections a lot so I wanted to try something all natural rather than another medication. My one complaint is that the label is rather confusing because these are ear drops but the directions talk about spraying it everywhere on your dog BUT inside the ears. It even mentions to spray it on the pads of their feet. How is that going to help an ear infection?
So I have been spraying only in my dog's ears and it seems to be helping I believe this is a minor premature statement as I feel I need to use it for at least a few weeks to make a truly sound decision. I do really like the smell of the spray. It doesn't seem to bother my dog either, except for when I'm actually spraying it. But afterwards he is just fine. And he smells good all day long. I did receive this at a discounted price for my honest review. That did not however affect my opinion in any way. I am glad to have found a natural product that works like chemicals.",1
"I am so clumsy when it comes to handling my electronic devices. I used to own a case for my iPad mini that had a screen protector attached to it. But it had to get rid of it because the plastic screen protector got damaged. I heard somewhere that tempered glass is superior to plastic, because when dropped the protector will sometimes crack but the phone glass underneath seems to resist damage better. This product is wonderful! It arrived in an lovely package with some envelopes. The kit contains clear instructions for installation in two different languages with clear diagrams. It took me a couple of tries to get it on just right because I didn't use the stickers. Despite this, my iPad mini looks great now! No bubbles, no dirt trapped inside  I sometimes forget that the tempered glass is on the screen. As an artist, I often use a stylus to sketch and draw on my iPad. This product allows me to create artwork, swipe, and makes gestures normally.

"These headphones both look and sound great, the bass on them is just right when played at regular levels and increases with the volume level. The 'noise cancelling' works great while listening to music at normal levels not necessary to drown out outside noise for it to work. Chord's long enough to play from pocket if that's your thing. Not easy to tangle which is great. I'm no audiophile but these are great headphones specially for the price, the packaging and the extra ear plugs are definitely a plus.

"My family loves music! From getting ready to driving in the car, music is usually always playing. In fact, it's a must! I have a hard time getting ready for out, as well as driving without it. For years we have had various ways of getting our phones to connect into the car, to play our music. From a casset tap connector, to various fm transmitters and auxiliary cords, they always seemed to not last or not work great. After we got our newer vehicle, with built in Bluetooth, it's always been a fight for who gets to drive the one with the very Bluetooth connection. That was until I ordered this Bluetooth FM transmitter. I was so excited . Get to try this product, because I knew it was one we needed and would really be able to put to the test. It arrived quickly and came in a nice, perfect size box. The transmitter is all black and very nice. The next morning there was a fight for the fist time to drive the older car! Me and my husband both wanted to test out this transmitter. We ended up flipping a coin! And then have it turns.

This transmitter is very easy to use, you just pair your cellphones bluetooth to the bluetooth on the FM transmitter. Once connected you can play your music and even answer or make phone calls. When you are connected,  you can hear a month voicing saying ""Bluetooth connected"". Answering an incoming call is now a breeze. The built-in microphone gives clear sounding phone calls, making it easy for both me and my husband to hear one another. I absolutely love having hands-free calling and being able to listen to my music. The bright LED display screen shows the name of some of my songs and shows caller ID. It also shows  current voltage of the storage battery of your car. This transmitter also has a USB charging station, so me or my passenger can charge a phone while one is connected.

Me and my husband both really love this Bluetooth transmitter. It's exactly what we have been searching for! Don't waste your money on other dinky ways to play your music, this high quality transmitter is the real deal! We strongly recommend this product.

"This is another good TP-Link router. This is similar design to their AC 5400 except this one has one 2.4, ghz, one 5ghz and the brand new 60 ghz. The new AD format with 60 GHZ is supposed to handle speeds up to 4600Mbps compared to 1733Mbps on 5ghz. The only issue this is brand new technology with NO wifi cards or computers set for AD format. Their is no way to test the 60 Ghz speeds or range. Per documentation the 60 ghz has a very short range (about 5 feet) and cannot go through walls. Until the range is improved I do not see this being a plus.
The router was easy to set up and install. I was up and running in less than 5 minutes after I unboxed it. The router sits flat and has 8 antennas than open up. (see pictures). I did several speed test using desktop computer hard wired, cell phone wifi and desktop using a wifi extender. Speeds were very good and constant. Range was outstanding with little drop off thanks to beam-steering technology and the 8 antennas. The MU-MIMO is a great feature for any home with multiple devices. (we have 2 desktops, 2 laptops, 2 cell phones, smart tv and 2 tablets on wifi). This router can handle them all without much effect on speed. The router has 4 Ethernet and 2 3.0 usb ports.

Pros:

"I ordered this Empyrean Queen Sheet Set to test it for quality, durability, fit and ease of use. I have never used this brand of bedding before and I was unsure what to expect. I was really surprised when I opened them and felt how soft they are. I was surprised to find a very nice booklet that gives you all kinds of information on sleep. It even gives instructions on how to use a duvet cover. You get the standard 4 pieces, fitted, flat and two pillowcases. What I really love is that there are straps on the fitted sheet to hold the sheet in place. These are really beautiful, soft, high quality sheets. They are made from brushed micro fiber that feels like a 1200 thread count. They are the perfect thickness to not be too thick or thin. I washed them in cold water, tumble dried on low and they came out wrinkle free. They are hypoallergenic and are breathable. I really live this sheet set and plan on ordering a second set. I would highly recommend this for anyone wanting a nice, soft, quality sheet set.

"I'm super excited to have this in my life! I know that sounds corny but I'm just excited to not have to use tea infuser balls :-) this is a great bottle. I love to drink herbal teas daily but I usually use a mason jar which makes things difficult when I'm wanting a hot infusion because it will burn my hands. The sleeve for this bottle is thick enough to prevent burn and tight enough to still give you a good grip on your bottle. It feels like it would protect it well. The bottom screws off to allow for removal of the infuser basket for easy cleaning. I was very surprised that they send a cleaning bottle scrubber for it with two different heads! The look and feel of the bottle is very upscale and modern. The glass has great weight to it. This is one of my news daily staples in life. It's the little things that make such a difference!

"Accurate fit, versatile and seems pretty robust so far. I like that it comes with the tempered glass screen protector. used these on my phones for years now and have never cracked a screen with one on. Phone can be reversed within the cover to have the screen facing out, or you can boost protection by facing the screen inside. The pocket clip that converts to a stand is a nice feature and seems like it will hold up well over time.",0

"The StickNsnap  15 Baby Monthly Necktie Onesie  Stickers  Happy Animals , Gray, Milestones for 12 months +3 Bonus Milestones stickers arrived quickly and packaged nicely.  The monthly age stickers are very adorable!  I have absolutely loved the idea of these stickers since the craze started.  I particularly love this set of stickers for their uniqueness.  I love the idea of a tie shaped sticker for boys instead of the generic round stickers.  This set is cutely designed with multiple color neck ties for each month and different animal representing each month.  The variety of animals include hen, cat, dog, donkey, crane, fox, bird, hyena/dog, rabbit, dog, squirrel, lizard, elephant, peacock, giraffe, lemur, mouse, monkey, toucan, and bear.  I particularly love the creative choice of characters and font for each tie.  In addition to having one sticker for each month for the first year, there are 3 milestone stickers provided.  They include I can Smile, I can stand, and I slept all night.  What a cute idea!  I really love these stickers.  Each sticker is on its own individual precut sheet to allow for simpler usage and smaller storage space.  These are really the perfect size.  I also like that each sticker has a photo glare reducing treatment.  This really makes a different when taking the picture. Additionally each sticker is smudge, water, and scratch resistant.  We all know how important that can be with little ones!!

"What is better than one tempered glass screen protector?
This is another great pack From BDowneer as far as it goes for protecting your screen. The package comes with everything you would expect, such as the materials to clean your screen properly prior to applying the screen protector. I have applied many of these in the past, and I highly recommend getting this pack because oftentimes, you may mess up putting it on the first time. It's a terrible feeling when you have waited for the product to come, only to mess up the process. Now, you get two shots. For those that aren't as much of a spaz as myself. Overall, I highly recommend his product. It is smooth to the touch, and protects your screen, at a great price, with the added convenience of getting two for the price of one.

The exercise gliding discs are perfect for him. They come with a little bag so they can be easily put away in his room. Because they are double sided, he is able to work out in his room on the carpet or in other areas on the hardwood floors. The orange side slides very easily over the carpet but adds an extra oomph to his workout. The black side made it safer to do the exercises on the wood. They went right over it sort of like a swiffer. My husband helped my son make sure he was doing the exercises properly to avoid injury. For a few of them they looked on line to make sure they were right. If you are not familiar with workouts including gliders, I would suggest doing some research. They are simple to use but things can go terribly wrong if you just jump in with no clue.

I received the gliding discs at a promotional rate for evaluation and honest feedback. My review is based on my son working out with the discs over a short period of time.",1

"We have a 9 month old puppy that is very active.  She gets bored easily and when we are gone 10 hours a day for work, she tends to get mad and become destructive.  We've tried giving her interactive toys to play with in our absence, but those only entertain her for so long.  I got the Pet Relief Stress Relief in an attempt to keep her calmer and more content.  It being a natural product was a must have!  I am unwilling to calm her with medications or anything that may cause adverse side effects.  I use it behind her ears and on the pads of her feet before I leave for work and it seems to be working.  The messes that I find upon returning home seem to be lesser and lesser.  It's only been about a week and a half and I will continue to use to hopefully see even more progress.

"As a fan of single malt scotch I jumped at the chance to try these soapstone whiskey stones/cubes when I had the chance. I'm a purist when it comes to my scotch, especially single malts, so putting ice in my drink is something I never do. As the ice melts it dilutes and, depending on the quality of the water, alters the flavors and aromas in the whiskey. I have seen and used different forms of whiskey or scotch stones/cubes and am always happy to try out new ones when given the opportunity.
The Choice of Connoisseurs brand whiskey stones/cubes are made of dark grey/charcoal colored Soapstone  and are roughly two centimeters in length on each side. They are a smooth (though not highly polished), and slightly heavier than they appear (so won't want to just drop them in your glass). The corners of the cubes are intentionally rounded to prevent them from damaging your glass as they clink around. The soapstone  is non-porous so they are able to cool the whiskey (or any beverage of your choice) without absorbing the liquid or imparting any additional flavors to your drink.

They cool down in a couple of hours in your freezer and to use, just place them in your drink, let sit for a few minutes, swirl and enjoy. When you're finished, you just wash them with some mild soapy water, let them air dry, and place them back in the freezer for the next time.

This was not my first experience with soapstone  whiskey stones, and as I stated earlier I was very pleased. There are times when I enjoy a nice warm dram, but to have the option of a nice scotch on the rocks without ruining the drink is wonderful. As far as Im concerned, I highly recommended them as a worthy addition to any scotch or whisky collectors bar paraphernalia.

"This passport holder was made with the finest grade genuine leather, soft and strong. It comes with RFID blocking feature to protect our card and passport and id from identity theft or RDIF reader close to you. The passport holder comes with 7 RFID LOCK slots: 1 slot for passport, 4 slots for cards and 1 wing pocket. It's enough to put in our passport, our credit cards, ID and boarding pass.

The passport holder also comes with a button closure snap to secure what's inside. It has a neat stitching on all the edges. Doesn't come with a gift box, but well presented. The only pro is that this passport holder was not a thin version, it's little bit bulky because it has few compartments or pockets. Other than that, everything was perfect.

"The supplier is selling this item as a beach cover up.  I will use it for a beach cover up but this shirt is made so nicely that I am going to wear it as a dress up shirt.  Really nice silky feeling material that has a nice quality feel.  The back of this shirt is black and the front if striped.  Really makes for a very classy shirt.  I will wear it more as a shirt than a cover up.  The cut and style on this shirt is really cute once I put it on.  The drape of the material on me, a size 16 woman, was perfect.  Really looked cute and stylish once I was wearing the shirt.

Sometimes when I order off the interest, the quality is just not there on some items.  This shirt has the even stitching, no loose threads making it look cheap.  The threads were not loose and the stitching was even and well sewn.  There is such a nice feel to this shirt.  I did use a black cami underneath the shirt since I am older but a younger person might wish to wear this without the cami for evening wear.

"I bought this backpack as a gift for my brother who us attending the university. It is very cute and doesn't look huge on him, yet carries EVERYTHING. This backpack is the real deal. It is very heavy duty and really protects your items. There's an awesome laptop slip that fits his laptop and an infinite amount of pockets that really let you be organized. It has so many compartments and really allows you to change up your look with its messenger bag transformation ability.

Pros:

- Great quality (the fabric & the strap rubber material)
- Got it wet due to sprinklers going off on me and everything stayed 100% protected
- Clasp buttons located underneath straps make for easy to snap the straps on/off
- Straps on the front are easily adjustable
- Very stylish and cute
- Right size (fits everything I need it to for several days at a time, including toiletries, my medication, 2-3 outfits, my MacBook Pro, power cords, jewelry, and other items, such as a spare pair of shoes).
- The fabric is highly adjustable, so you can cram this backpack full and have it carry everything, or pack it lightly and clasp the sides so the backpack looks smaller when wearing it
- Zip up pocket on the front is easily accessible when wearing this bag for items you want to access without taking your backpack off (ex: your subway card)
- The inside zipper pocket is large and houses a great amount of smaller items you don't want to lose.
- The other inside pocket really does a great job separating itself from the main compartment.
- TWO WATER BOTTLE HOLDERS!!! now-a-days plastic water bottles (i know.. i'm terrible and should get a refillable one) are made really thinly for good reasons, but the caps are TERRIBLE and never close properly. I've had so many issues with things getting wet inside my backpack due to rogue water bottles and this really solves my problem.
- You can make this into two different backpacks.. it's messenger bag and a regular backpack

Cons:

- I'm not a fan of the writing on the front... but it's still a nice bag.

"I never knew solar powered LEDs could be this useful.  Way better than I thought they would be.  I got a set of 4 (8 LEDs in each one). They came well packaged.  Good build quality. I have been using for about a couple of days and expect them to last a while (at least last long enough to justify the price).  Lights came with anchors and screws for mounting (which I did not use).  Very easy to set up. I put mine out in the sun for a couple of hours before turning them on (be sure to take off the plastic from the solar panel and the LED light).  I mounted mine with mounting tape since I didn't want to put holes in the vinyl or wood.  Even on the dim settings it can light up an area well enough to see everything.  When motion is sensed they turn bright and light up the entire area.  They are good enough that I no longer use my hard wired lights (and I have a fairly large backyard for a dog to run around).  I will buy some more to put around my house and rental properties. If these do not light up enough of your yard, get ones with more LEDs.  You can also use them elsewhere (patio, deck, steps, inside your shed).

"When I think about summertime the only thing I could not stand are mosquito bites  these creatures are everywhere and they don't give up, no matter what you use against them.

And though each and every year I somehow managed to get through, my preschool kids I am more desperate to protect during the hot summer days and nights. So, I used many different solutions trying to find something that really works. Last year we tried sprays but I was all the time worried because of its smell that kids are going to inhale danger chemicals. Therefore I decided I would try this lamp.

My first surprise was the fact how compact this lamp is - lightweight, waterproof and with durable attery inside. Conveniently, it can be placed into the ground using the ground spike or mounted to a wall.

The battery lasts around 9-10 hours and no manual setup is required  it will automatically charge during the day and turn on during the night.

Therefore I am happy I managed to solve my issue for good and my kids will finally sleep and play calmly. Also, because they love to play outside I don't have to worry anymore they could get bitten given how these days mosquitos bites can be dangerous, carrying different type of diseases.

In conclusion, I can recommend this lamp as an effective solution against mosquitos, for kids and adults, during summertime, but also when you are in nature  hiking, camping, fishing, biking or doing any outdoor activity such as simple walk in park.

"Nice unit.
Wound up with a huge ammount of free tv with this little bugger, over 64 to start and really sharp picture. Deleted a couple of shopping/televangelist/foriegn ones but still a lot of free content out there. ( 40 miles from Cleveland using a 11 dollar,35 mile range antenna thingie )
Be sure to format any thumb drives to ntfs (it's easy) so you can fast forward and rewind any saved vids you record. The fst32 format won't do that. Mind you, we were using a 128GB name brand drive that came formatted  fat32...
Recorded the olympics for 2 weeks and it was easy to use straight out of the box.
Had to yank 2 AAAbatteries out of another remote as this one came without any.
Use a high speed thumb drive too.
Had to unplug it twice when pushing too many buttons on the remote at one time setting it up in channel search.....just let it do it's 3 minute thing and all will be fine.
Recording and programming was easier than expected.

"its a great quality case, slim but it protects great. I like the material and it doesn't feel slippery like it would fall out of your hands but it also isn't sticky that it would get dirty. Its great that the sides are covered so it won't get dirt stuck inside. The edges have a lip on them so it will protect your corners, the color is great. I just wish that he rubber on the inside is padded, it makes me feel safe keeping my phone in it. Also the back of the case is not slippery like other cases that look like this. You can see that it is a quality product. the charging hole port isn't that big which I find as a good thin because it means less dirt in my phone.

"I received these earbuds in the mail today, and I am very pleased.  My 10 year old son is very happy, too!
PROS:
- Great packaging. The box is a nice, semi-gloss white box with slightly raised, gloss lettering. (I ordered the blue and white pair.) Box was sealed nicely and would be appropriate for gift giving.
- The earbuds came packaged in a black, labeled, zippered, hard shell case.
- They came with 2 additional sets of blue, in ear ""cushions"" that could be switched out based on the size of the ear opening.
- Also included was a splitter so that kids can listen along with a friend
- Although this wasn't a huge concern for me, they are volume limited so your kids don't blow their ears out.
- These are marketed as kids earbuds, but they fit in my ears just fine with the smallest ""cushion"" in.
- In cord volume adjustment and microphone is a nice feature, too.

CONS:
- Sound is not as great as a set of original Apple earbuds, but the sound is still a nice quality.

All in all, I am happy with these and would recommend them to friends.  I received these in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

"This silicone fold-able water bottle is awesome! If you have small children like I do you know that one of the most dreaded phrases, after ""I have to go potty right now!"", happens to be ""I'm thirsty."" Especially for those of us moms with kids in the under 6 category, because the simply can't wait and there always seems to be a magical correlation between your child's immediate and dire thirst and the price of a bottle of water. ;) This bottle now comes to the rescue!

The bottle comes rolled up and I have to say I was seriously impressed with how small it folds down. It's the perfect size to tuck into a purse, backpack, or diaper bag. The fact that it rolls out easily into a full sized bottle is both surprising and cool to see after seeing how tiny it folds down. I really love that I can toss this in my purse and pop it out when needed. My son's favorite thing to do while we are shopping is to tell me, at the top of his rather well developed lungs of course, that he is 'dying of thirst' and ""going to die any second"" if he doesn't get a drink. Such a drama king! And he seems to have a sixth sense for when I don't have a water bottle or when we are exactly the farthest point away from any free drinkable water source. Enter this bottle! A quick pit stop at the nearest water fountain, and voila! Problem solved. He also likes the feel of the bottle with it being made of the soft-ish silicone and the pink color is a favorite of his too. It is super bright and cute!

I was lucky enough to receive this fold-able silicone water bottle at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. Honestly, It's a life saver when I'm out and about with my kids! I love how easily it packs down and the amount of water it holds is fantastic. I think that these should come standard with every toddler. ;)",1
"I love the extra padding provided by this rug pad! The one real comment I would make about it though is that you should consider the thickness of your rug before purchasing this product. If the rug you are placing this under is already very plush, you won't be adding as much padding as you would with a less plush rug. I was initially concerned with the placement of and the number of the rubber dots meant to keep the rug in place, but the weight of the pad alone will keep it from sliding around. The texture of the pad keeps the rug in place on top of the pad.
If you want to cut down the pad for a smaller sized rug, I recommend a sturdy scissors or sharp utility knife (AND A PROTECTED WORK SPACE! Don't scratch your floor trying to cut down the pad!). The pad is very sturdy; this makes cutting it a task for a heavier duty blade.

"I purchased a new laptop that did not have a built in disk drive which made it hard for me to install my existing software that I needed on my computer. I could've downloaded it from the Internet but I also wanted to be able to back up my photos to disc because I do alot with photography so I purchased this CD/DVD burner rewriter.
I have been using it for a few days now and it has been working well for me. My laptop runs on Windows 10 and when I plugged this in to the USB port my computer recognized it immediately and I was able to use it to install my software flawlessly.
I burnt a disk full of pictures onto a dvd and it only took a few minutes.
What I really like about this is that you don't need to plug this unit into any additional power source it runs off the power supplied by the 3.0 USB cord. This makes it very portable when you want to use it on the go and are not around a power outlet.
The cord isn't very long ( only 8"") but stores nicely underneath when it is not in use.
There is a tray that pops out for you to place the disc on.
I tried to play a dvd with this but it wouldn't. I'm not sure if I just need additional software to play one or it just doesn't support it
I was very satisfied with this for installing software and burning photo dvd's and would definately recommend this to anyone needing to do the same.

"This bookshelf is really cute and incredibly simple to put together. However, don't expect to display more than 20 regular sized books and make sure they are taller books so the titles can be seen. My son loves to read so I wanted a mini library display where I could place current library books or old books of his and rotate them out, which this is ideal for. But if you are wanting a bookshelf to put baby books and a large collection of small books this unit is not right for that. The reason for four stars is because I thought I'd be able to fit two medium sized books in each slot but unless the books are really thin it'll only fit one.",0

Disclosure: I did receive this product at free or discounted price, however my review is honest and holds no bias!",1
I'm very pleased with this tablecloth. Very nicely made. It washed well in cold water and dried in dryer- no wrinkles! I will purchase another color!,0
Simple. Easy to install. Drivers took a matter of seconds.,0

"The seller does not give very much information to make a decision on this product, so I will try to tell you as much as I can. This Minimalist Full Grain Leather Wallet from seller, Tovier, is made of full grain leather and closes with a zipper. I thought I was going to get a blue wallet, but this looks black to me. It doesn't matter though--either color is fine. The wallet can hold cash, identification, change and other small items. By using the term minimalist, I think they mean to say lean and small, which this wallet is. It measures 5.3 inches by 4.5 inches by .9 inches thick. Empty, the wallet weighs a mere 3.2 ounces. This wallet is small enough to easily fit into a pocket, and I will use it when I go somewhere that I don't want to have to worry about having a purse. The leather is a nice quality, and the zipper zips well, but I wish it zipped a little bit further around the pouch. When the zipper is open it is a little awkward to place things inside and retrieve them, but not too bad. Also, at less than an inch thick, this wallet has limited capacity before it gets to bulky. If you are going somewhere and just need a safe place for your license, a card and perhaps a few bills you will be just fine. I like my wallet and the blue color is trendy and stylish. I will use this product. I hope this review helps to better inform your purchasing decision on this product. Thanks for reading.

"I got these Bluetooth headphones for my husband who seem to go through headphones every couple months. So this review will be his option on them. He said the following about them:
They are made of durable plastics with durable flexible rubber that goes around your neck. The sound quality is really good and the battery last a long time before you have to charge it. It was fairly simple to connect them to my phone and I really like the overall design of them. The ear pieces fit snugly in my ears and the buttons are the ear piece are easy to operate. My only complaint is that they feel too small on my head. Maybe it's because the rubber neck piece don't straighten out and want to coil back up but it makes it to uncomfortable to wear for the long periods of time I tend to use a head phones.

"I can't wait to give all my future presentations with this device when school starts back up next Fall! This product found a way to give you all the control you could possibly need for a presentation at your thumbs range. I tested it with Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides. PowerPoint works best with it, but I think it's worth noting that this remote works with Google Slides and possibly other presentation software as well. One of my favorite features is that you can use it to move your mouse curser like a Wii remote mouse combo. This allows for ease of showing off hyperlinks in PowerPoint and links in Google Slides. It also has a powerful laser pointer threat you have to be careful not to blind someone with.

"Bought these as an addition to my OXO cookie press. I love the cookie press, I have only tried making spritz cookies with cream cheese so far with it however every time I make the cookies they are the hit of the party and everyone eats them up so fast! Its a good thing you can make a lot of spritz cookies with one batch. I have quite a few discs for my cookie press and this will be a great expansion to use during the upcoming holiday season. I got this for an unbeatable price here so I cannot complain, this Christmas is gonna be awesome!",0

"I cannot express how much I love these enough! The pink color is so fun and vibrant, and adds some spunk to the baking in the house. The kids absolutely love it!

The pans are nice and flexible, durable, and bake up nicely. The quality is great, and I love being able to pop our our fresh baked goods. We were able to make muffins and mini cheesecakes in them - We just love the multi sizes.

We did use pan liners, I am a huge fan of having the paper on the goodies so when we eat them we keep our hands nice and clean, so I cannot say how well the items bake without them, but I will say we love these silicone molds so much!

If you are looking for a nice set as a gift, or just for yourself, I think it is safe to say you found one!

"These headphones are super lightweight and they stay put.  They are also comfortable, I often forget that I have them in.  The sound quality is great, and the sound quality during phone calls is great on both ends.  I have a LOT of headphones and this one is one of my top 2, only much much less expensive then the number 1 and that one only goes in one ear!  The buttons are great, my daughter was watching a youtube video on her phone using these headphones and was able to pause the video from the button on the headset.  Very easy to pair with my Android as well as with my computer and my daughter's Android phone.  I would highly recommend these if you are looking for a great bluetooth headset at a really super reasonable price.

"Purchased this awesome pillow to help get a better nights sleep. I am a side sleeper and have been having pain in my neck and shoulder  from trying to situate 2 pillows just so.
After only a few nights using the Zenith Bamboo Pillow, I am sleeping much better. I feel more rested, and the pain is gradually  subsiding.
With continued use it feel the pain will go away. I have noticed fewer headaches as well.
The pillow came in rolled up neatly in a super nice carrying  pouch. Once opened, the pillow went from flat to pillow shaped in less than an hour. The covering had a slight scent to it but it must have been from the package materials used because the smell went away.
My pillow is queen sized, bigger than a standard size but smaller than a king size pillow, it fills out a pillow case nicely.
The cover is made of Bamboo  from rayon ( 40% ) and Microfiber  ( 60% )
Pillow helps ease allergies, asthma and other breathing conditions  due to the Hypoallergenic  and dust mite resistant  qualities of the pillow.  Plus the cover is machine washable.
Zen Bamboo Pillow  offers a 30 day money back satisfaction  guarantee  as well.
I definitely  recommend this pillow even if all you are looking for is a more restful  nights  sleep.
I received this pillow at a deeply discounted price for giving my honest and unbiased opinion.",1
This was purchased for my sons 8th birthday. He has been learning on my DSLR but wanted a camera that he could have fun with. He's brought this to the beach and several water attractions and we've had no problems. The pictures aren't half bad for a point and shoot and there are a lot of fun features included.  We both love that the pictures upload easily to his tablet. The camera came on time and as promised.,0
"These sporks are simple and work well. We usually go camping and bring either our regular silverware, or use plastic toss away utensils. I hate having to buy plastic utensils and I hate creating extra waste while camping. These sporks are the perfect solution. They are made of heavy duty steel and won't bend or break. They wash clean really easily as well. We are going camping in a few weeks and I plan on using these. I like hat they come with a carry case. This will help keep them all together and prevent me from losing them. My daughter and I had lunch the other day with them to test them out and we were able to eat without any issues. We used the fork part for cantaloupe and the spoon part for pasta. It's a great set of utensils for camping.

"I got this in the mail today and it was super awesome and overly compact. I really like it because I was able to put it in my emergency kit along with my radio like some food and some other things that I could easily use if anything were to happen and or I could also take the same backpack camping. I think that this is absolutely necessary it comes in a case as well and it's very convenient and I could easily see this coming in handy. It is also well made and I would definitely recommend this product.

Everybody has different results for every product so with that being said the only way to really know if you like this product is to try to yourself. I do believe that all items, regardless of personal reviews should be testing on your own for a true personal experience that one cannot always obtain through anothers'.

"I have used this product for couple of weeks now. I was using my Fitbit charge HR for a year now with the the original charging cable. The original charging cable was so small that it didn't even reach my bedside table from the charging port behind it. So, I had to leave it dangling by the charging cable often to realize in the morning that my Charge HR has fell off. If I can say anything about this device I would say some users might feel it a tad bit tight to remove and connect.
I would like to state in your review that you received the product for free or at a discount. But my review is honest to my experience.",1
We decided that we wanted to cut the cord and get rid of our cable. We purchased an antenna with the rabbit ears and it works quite well for the most part. However at different times of the day some of the channels would start to pixelate or be completely unavailable. With this antenna we received 23 different channels. So when I came across this one I was hoping it would be better to use and we wouldn't have to constantly readjust the antenna ears. However this one only got us 6 channels. While it is not a terrible antenna it still works ok and will do just fine for our daughter's room. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest unbiased review.,1
"Do you go one long jogs or run a lot. Then this might be the running belt for you. One thing you should know about this belt is, the belt is huge. I wasn't expecting it to be so big, so it has lots of extra weight to it. Then adding your phone and two full water bottles, it's gets even heavier. So do keep that in mind when deciding to pick this running belt up. I personally love the belt but I do think it's overtly big for no reason. When adding your phone to the belt you also have extra room to put other things in the pocket, that's nice if you want to put your wallet or your ID's in it. The build quality is good. The only thing that I would have enjoyed is if this belt came with better water bottles. The bottles this belt comes with looks like one you can get at a dollar store. Overall this is a nice running belt if you are wanting a belt that has room for a water bottle, then this is the belt for you!

1.  This is a very high quality, well made grow light
2.  Super Bright - I would recommend hanging it quite high so the soft beams hit your plants and you're not blasting them with the light.  Also, that makes it so you can keep the extra heat off the plants as well.  This does not get as hot as other lights do, but it will emit heat.
3.  Totally recommend it!
4.  Covers a very large area.

"LP Placemats 2x Silicone Baking Mat Set arrived quickly and were well packaged (thanks Amazon). The mats are in a small brown carton without any instructions included. Unlike others they are rolled and sealed in a clear plastic bag so they slip out of the box easily. The mats are heavy duty which was a welcomed surprise as we have so from a local retail shop that were so flimsy. Our first test for the silicone mats were a couple pieces of marinated Salmon which turned out spectacular. The fish and marinade had no chance of sticking on the silicone. We usually bake our fish on tin foil to avoid the messy cleanup as the fish usually has a little burn of the marinade along the edges and outward from the fish. On the silicone mat we simply let the mat cool and then rinsed it clean and all of the mess came right off. No scrubbing or hard clean up (use mild soapy water for stubborn crud). And no more wasted tin foil. We are excited to try some more baking treats next but want to post our first impression of the silicone baking mats so others can decide to try them as well.

Note: Do not cut on the mat, no broiling or direct flames, do not use directly on heating element and keep temperature under 482 degrees F (250 C).

Great product that I would highly recommend and we will continue to use these at every chance we can. Give it a try and see if you experience the same results.

I use this Fotofo  Wireless bluetooth  keyboard with mouse Touchpad on my fire TV Box. I like the multi-touch Touchpad because it supports various finger gestures to get full function.

"My husband is the ""outside"" person at our house.  He takes care of the car washing and filling the pool, etc.  This heavy duty hose has been very helpful to him.

We honestly did have another brand of expandable garden hose at the beginning of the summer but it didn't hold up very well.  This one is much thicker.  This one even has a shut off valve.  He is extremely impressed with it being so lightweight, yet being so powerful.  He loves outside work, so he loves his new toy!

When I opted in for this product I was under the understanding that it was an OtterBox brand case however when I received it I realized that it was not an OtterBox brand but is Cellexcellence brand.  I have to met that at first I was a bit disappointed until I receive the product and seen the quality firsthand and got to look at it in front of my face and see for myself how wonderfully constructed this product is. Now I would have to venture to say that I do believe that this product  is in fact built  even better than an OtterBox. It has a rugged silicone case that you put on the phone first. The phone sets in it and the edges of the case go right up to the edge of the class on the phone then there is  A hard plastic case that goes around the silicone. There is also a plastic clip case that goes over the other two cases to provide added protection from drops were other accidents. This product also comes with a lifetime guarantee.  I received this product for free exchange for an honest unbiased and fair review and like I said before much to my surprise I am so pleased with this product that I will probably purchase another one in another color for myself as my son liked it so much he stole it from me.  This product recieves two thumbs up from me and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable well-built and sturdy case for their phone.,1

These are working great on his older tablet and are a cost effective way to keep him with a cable that will charge his devices.

"I just want to say I absolutely love these glass screen protectors, first of all you are unable to tell that they are on, they don't have bubbles like the plastic screen protectors do, it seems like these are nice and clear and you can't really tell they are on unless you really look for it to be on the phone, it is a nice and easy process to apply these to your screen, 1st you use the enclosed wet pad and wipe your phone clean so that there are no smudges or dirt, then you go ahead and use the dry cloth to get rid of any residue left over, and then you put the screen on, its a very easy process instead of having to get your screen replaced. I actually dropped my phone a couple times with these on and it only cracked the protector and not the screen at all, I would highly recommend to use these.

"Between the heat,  humidity, and the rain we have had where I live,  the flies have been horrible. If I tried to sit outside of my apartment, I had to take a fly swapped with me because they were so bad. Now since I had purchased this,  that is not an issue any more. We actually ran a long extension cord so that it could be put up in the middle of the 3 downstairs apartments on my side of the building so no matter where we sit,  no more flies.

"This hammock by Hom-Eco makes a great place to setup and relax. The hammock is very easy to setup up and take down with in a matter of minutes. The hammock is conveniently stored in an attached bag to the hammock. The bag also has straps around the bag to make it easier to compress the bag to a smaller size. The smaller size comes in great use when traveling or hiking with the hammock but don't want to bring a lot of weight or stuff with you. The stitching in the hammock is really clean and is triple stitched all on the sides and ends of the hammock. The color options are also a nice chose when picking the hammock. I ordered the blue hammock and the colors match exactly to the picture provided by HomEco. In the package they also included two carabiners and some rope. The carabiners were nothing special and pretty standard, but did have some sharp edges which could cause a hole in the hammock. The rope included is super standard, literally just rope and didn't include any instructions on how to tie the rope. The focus is on the hammock, and that is great!
Pros:
-comes with nice bag to store the hammock in
-has compression straps stitched to bag to make it smaller
-good triple stitching
Cons:
-carabiners are sharp
-no instructions on how to setup the hammock with included string

"I am fair skinned and I burn every year when we go to the beach. This year I decided to buy a goofy looking hat to wear to help shade my head, face, and neck. I bought the hat and tried it on and was impressed as soon as I put it on. It's not goofy at all and it is really light weight and comfortable. The hat can be easily thrown into a suitcase but at the same time, it holds its shape well. There are holes in the top of the hat for ventilation and buttons on the side of the hat if you want to go for the Australian look. The hat has a great color as well! I wore this every day on the beach and it not only protected me from the sun but it also did a great job keeping me cool! I would highly recommend this hat to anyone that will be outside and needs to be protected from the sun!

"It sounds like I have a version 1 where the top doesn't fit maybe as well as it should, and it would be nicer to have a larger notch cutout to run a heater cord alongside the pump cord.  Frankly if you just want a betta, get a nice betta aquarium.  And if you just want sprouts, get a glass jar.  But together it's a nice conversation piece that actually works pretty well, and with a little practice the tank stays pretty clean, you get nice sprouts, and frankly its quite relaxing to have around.

I tried some other sprouts, and they worked ok, but I keep going back to the radish sprouts.  They're unusually tasty and grow super fast.  I bought a pound bag of radish sprout seeds on Amazon that should tide me over for awhile.  Plan on eating a lot of sprouts, or chucking a lot of them in the compost if you don't eat them before they get too big.

With a single betta, I don't find that the tank stays clean itself.  Perhaps I need more Zymbac, not sure.  I only clean the tank every three weeks or so, that seems enough.  I use a smallish aquarium syphon you can get anywhere.  Bettas are hardy, I change about 75% of the water and he doesn't seem to care.  In fact he seems used to it, by maybe the fourth time he comes over to investigate the syphon, but doesn't seem to be acting particularly stressed at all.  For most of his existence he has 3 gallons with a fake plant and log to himself, and easy food.  He seems pretty happy.

This is not an expensive endeavor to keep going, especially if you like sprouts.  I'm still on the sample package of food it came with, and its been months.  Bettas don't eat a lot.",1
"This case OK for the price you are paying, at the time of this review it is $7.99. It is worth noting it is a ripoff of the Lifeproof case from Otterbox, with a $92 price difference. The case itself is flimsy without the phone in it. I was concerned because without the phone the bottom cover doesnt close. Once the phone is in everything closed as it is suppose to.

Saying all that I think this a great case to protect against dust and dirt. I would never dunk my phone in the water with this on. I plan on using this when Im hiking and camping. I think this will work perfectly those situations.

The camera works fine. I am very sensitive to anything in front of the lens but I didn't see much of a difference in pictures or video. Because the ports are covered your speaker and mic do sound a bit off but nothing too major. If it bothers you too much I would get a bluetooth headset.

Overall I think this is a decent product. I will be using it while Im out hiking and camping. Again I won't be scuba diving with it but it will protect my phone from dust and debris.

06-28 UPDATE: I used this at the pool and it was very nice to not have to make sure my hands were dry before using my phone. The case offers a good amount of grip to a very slippery phone. I even felt comfortable taking pictures by the water. Due to the thinness of the case I still don't think it will protect my phone from a fall. Again for the price this is a pretty good case. I still don't know

"Okay so I'm writing a REAL review on these earphones because no one seems to do so. I actually purchased these after reading mixed reviews. I wasn't sure what to expect from these, I was honestly pretty scared to waste 30$ on cheap earphones. I had these for a couple days already and they sound really  great tbh I'm loving the nice bass. These are comfortable I used them for about 3 hours each day for the 6 days I had them and still don't need to charge them. They don't echo when I walk at all. They connect fast asf. But not sure if I should be worried because last night I was using them for a little longer than I usually do and I noticed the remote part was getting noticly warmer. I don't think it was anything. But the only 2 CONS I do have with these are that they are a lot bigger than in picture. And I was so disappointed that they don't connect to 2 devices at once. I repeat they DO NOT. I contacted the company online and told me it's not possible. They only alternate between 2 devices if you turn Bluetooth off on one of them. And for the big circle silver part of the earphones, they may be really big and make you look like Frankenstein I just grabbed a black sharpie and colored it in so now it doesn't look that noticly big. But my overall review is okay. I will answer questions and I will do another update in about 2 weeks or so. But other than that there's no real cons about these. Works like it's supposed to and sound great. OH! and the mic phone calling is just as great if not better than phone microphone. And I think I spoke too soon I'm currently using them and it went from 50% to 10% fast not sure if it's a glitch in my phone but they died lol",0
"It seems like everyone I know has a Yeti tumbler or one of the many replicas available, and my family is no exception. We actually own several stainless steel double wall insulated tumblers in various sizes. However, I have decided that the 20 ounce size is the best for me!

As an owner of both brands, this 20 ounce tumbler by ARCTIC works just as well as the Yeti Brand tumblers. My family owns two Yeti Colsters, one Yeti Low Ball, and a 32 ounce tumbler made by another brand. I really like the size of the 20 ounce tumbler best for everyday use, because I feel like the 32 ounce one is just too bulky and heavy for my taste.

This 20 ounce tumbler comes with an acrylic plastic lid with a wide mouth opening that will fit most straws or can be used to sip alone. It has a slider closure. This cup really does keep liquids cold. I can leave a cup of ice water on my nightstand and it will still have plenty of ice the next morning. I even left a cup of ice water in my car while I worked and there was still ice in my cup at the end of my work day. I live in Georgia so even in the covered parking garage, temperatures reach the 80's during the summer! I do find that the cup is a lot more effective at keeping ice when it is full of liquid. It does not last nearly as long when only half full.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. It's my new favorite cup!",1

"The Vino Luxe Premium Waiter's Corkscrew with Rosewood Handle was promptly delivered and arrived in a cardboard box. The corkscrew is extremely attractive with the rosewood handle and subtle engraving along the spine. The corkscrew is of appropriate weight and carries your standard tools including foil cutter and bottle opener. The tools are sturdy within the corkscrew allowing for ease in opening wine or beer bottles. It feels very sturdy and well made, likely to endure many years of use without problems. Overall, an excellent choice for a standard corkscrew which is otherwise extremely attractive and would make an ideal gift. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for an attractive, high quality standard corkscrew and bottle opener.

"I really like this product. We got the bigger of the pillows, I usually use two or three pillows and you will not be able to do that with this pillow. I know only use this pillow under my head and am sleeping great. If you try to use more than one pillow you will get a crick in your neck. It took a few days to work out the best sleeping option but once I found it I have slept well.",0

"Found on Amazon, vetted with Firmstrong.com, and purchased from Beachbikes.net ($70 savings for chrome bike though paid $30 for fedex, 2-day delivery to northern Calif.). Excellent packaging. Simple assembly in 40 min (with your tools).  Perfect instructions.  Parts all fit well with no mechanical issues with pre-assembled gear and crank.  Sized well and excellent weight for a cruiser. Just leisurely riding with my kids so perfect ride and comfort for my needs.",0

"This leash appears to be very well-made, it seems tough and durable but it's nice looking too. The waist belt is very adjustable, and the stitching on everything seems well done.

This leash, however, wasn't a good fit for me and my dog. It's not the leash's fault, it just wasn't a good match. But I am giving it a five star review because Mighty Paw's customer service is outstanding. Their communication is great, they promptly helped me return it and give me a refund. They answered my email within a day. Sadly, good customer service is hard to come by these days, but Mighty Paw is doing it right and I will definitely buy from them again.",0
"I ordered these no tie elastic shoe laces to replace the tie laces in my running shoes.  These laces are amazing. The day I got them I put them on my shoes. They did not come with instructions but were pretty self-explanatory and very easy to put on. Just lace the shoe up as you normally would and then slip the laces through the adjuster clip. The laces are very long so I was going to have to cut them so they didn't drag. After attaching the adjuster clip I adjusted the laces to the correct  tightness so they weren't too tight. Once we had the laces where i wanted them I measured the laces by laying them down over the threaded laces. I wanted them to be cut right below where the bottom lace was so I could have the bottom part through the bottom lace so it wouldnt move around. Once I clipped the laces, I slipped one end of the lace through the bottom threaded lace and then put both laces in the bottom clip and clipped it together.
I have been wearing the laces for about a week now and haven't had any issues with the clip coming undone to the laces losing elasticity. So far they are wonderful and doing exactly what I hoped they would, saving my sanity. They  look cool and loves the reflectiveness of them. I love these because I hate having to tie and untie my shoes each time and the time for flip flops is coming to an end so it will be back to tennis shoes for me soon. I am required to state that I received these at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1
"This French press is perfect for making iced coffee. Don't do as I did though and used pre ground coffee. WOW. it was strong!  after I received a coffee grinder I set the blades for a way coarser grounds. It was the way it should taste. You add your water then add the amount of ground coffee you should be using, stir well,  put the lid on and leave the plunger up. Refrigerate over night, plunge down on the plunger and pour. Your ready to add your fixings and go. I don't like my coffee real strong so instead of adding eight tbls for twenty four ounces I added six. That was perfect for me.  I had read online that the better your water, the better your coffee. It's true. Bottled water taste way better than tap. I'm not a big coffee master or anything like that so make sure you do plenty of recipe research and French press coffee making. There is tons of information online that I wished I would have researched first. The more I learn the better tasting it gets. So whether your making iced or hot brewed coffee this press works pretty good. I did purchase this product at a reduced price in return for a honest and unbiased revue. I hope I've helped you out.",1
"I cant love these they are ok and do the job basically but are not robust enough to stand up to me.

"I love glass screen protector for the smooth glass feel and the protection it gives on the phone screen. I like everything about this glass protector, great screen size, nice and smooth feel but it doesn't adhere on all sides. The right upper sides has some clicky noise whenever I am pressing that part because it doesn't seem to stick on the part. I tried to move the glass protector a little bit to the other side because of maybe I put it way too much on that sides but it end up clicky on the other side so I am guessing it's the screen protector not sticking much on the sides. That said obviously it will have some problem when touching the screen on that part where it won't stick so I tend to press harder whick is annoying. I really wanted to love this glass screen protector but the clicky noise is just bothering me too much.

"I received a discount on this product for review purposes. I think it's well worth the full price. The metal plates that attach to the device are thin enough to be unobtrusive, and the adhesive on them is durable. There's also the option to just insert the plate between your device and its case, if you prefer not to stick something to the phone. The construction of the vent clip is sturdy, and it holds in place very well. If you're looking for a simple way to mount your device in your car, I would recommend this.",1
"When I first received the exercise ball, I was amazed at how thick the rubber ball felt deflated. The yoga exercise ball box came with a hand/foot pump, a measuring tape, and yoga towel. I use the yoga towel first because I had a yoga class the evening that my package arrived. I was quite impressed with the softness, yet non-plushness of the yoga towel. When my hands sweat, it it did not lose grip on my yoga mat and it was thin enough that it didn't add extra weight or squishiness to my mat.
The pump used to inflate the yoga ball can be used as a hand or foot pump, and took about 7 minutes to totally inflate the yoga ball.
Once I got the yoga ball inflated, I couldn't keep my kids off of the ball. They have been bouncing around the house since I inflated it. My husband has also rolled all over the ball frontwards and backwards and the ball has held up nicely.
After my husband and children went to sleep the other night I was able to try the yoga ball out for myself. I was able to use it for stretching my back out as well as do push-ups with my feet elevated on top of the ball. I appreciate that the ball is sturdy and has held up to the abuse my family is put it through already even before I got a chance to use it. I look forward to many more times of using the towel in yoga practice and  also the ball in home exercising.

"I just hooked this up and I agree with the users who say that this sucker is way too bright on default settings.  After adjustment, things look good.  No  dead pixels (thus far) and setup was straightforward.

One thing to note.  The box does not appear to list the contents and the description on Amazon only refers to ""Connectivity"", it never actually lists the included items.

So as a service to anyone considering this item, I'll fill in the blanks. My purchase arrived with the following in the box:
-Monitor and stand
-Cable management attachment
-CD (haven't used it)
-Power cable
-3.5mm male to male audio cable
-Display Port cable
-DVI cable
-VGA cable
-USB to ""?"" cable (I'm not familiar with one end of this cable, looks similar to something that you plug into printers from the 1990's.)

Noticeably absent was an HDMI cable.  That was the only one I cared about (short of the power cable, of course.)

So unless mine is a fluke, since no one else mentions it in other reviews I've read, don't expect an HDMI cable to come with this unit.",0

"Oh my goodness, this ring is so so pretty!

I have always been in love with this rexact style ring..except of course in the real version LOL, but could never afford it. So I figured why not? Let's go ahead and get this one so we can look down at our hand and see a version of my dream ring every day.
 The Rosegold is perfect and flawless and has no scratches. The small diamonds around it look 100% real. The Center Stone even though it's not real, is certainly doing its job in looking like the real thing.
It arrived in a really nice ring box, and fit perfectly. I'm slowly adding to my rose gold collection and having this piece is making me very happy.
The ring is extremely feminine and elegant. I'm extremely thrilled with being able to have this ring and it's making me very happy.

"These ""leggings"" are more like tights than leggings. They are not thick like leggings normally are which means that being white, they are quite see through - Pair with LONG shirts or skirts!!
The material is absolutely wonderful. I love the feel. They are probably the softest pair of tights I've ever had or felt. The ""one size"" thing really throws me as well. It's very difficult to make a one size. They fit me around the legs and waist, but I'm short, so I end up pulling them really high and still they are definitely not ""quarter"" length.  On me, at 5 food 2 inches, they are all the way down past my ankles.
I'm not quite sure I'd recommend these to anyone. Mostly because if you're looking at them you're looking for leggings and these are most definitely not leggings.

I was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discount for my honest review. My opinions are my own and are in no way influenced by the companies from whom I purchase my products.

"This screen protector is hands down the easiest screen protector I have ever installed on a cell phone. This protector is not your usual flexible film. The Ivoler is a premium tempered shatterproof glass protector that is much thicker than normal. It is much more rigid which is what makes it so easy to apply for a bubble free installation. It arrives in a very nice hard shell package and is packed with goodies to make the installation easier. Included is a wet wipe to clean the phone surface, a cloth for drying it off and a sticky pad to remove any remaining contaminants. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I had some concerns that the thick protector would effect the phone's performance. I was pleased to find out that there was no noticeable difference in the screens sensitivity or the appearance. If anything the screen is easier to see as there appears to be less glare than before. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and the performance is great. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. Everything in this review is my honest opinion.",1
"This is my 2nd pair of these types of laces. My first pair is still going strong on my running shoes after several years. These are exactly as advertised. Easy to put together, although I think they should include a couple of close-up photos for those who are new to these laces. The quality of the laces feel top-notch and the plastic components seem to be solid and not likely to break over time. These are a great if you travel by plane when you have to take off your shoes in the security line. I have slight arthritis in one of my hands and these laces make it a snap to securely lace up my shoes.  I received these at a discount for giving my honest opinion. I would have given this same review whether I received a discount or not.",1
"I am a female who works as a server at a nice French bistro restaurant on the weekends. As part of my uniform, I am required to wear a white oxford button down shirt and tie. I used to wear my husband's ties as this was the most convenient thing to do. However, his ties are fairly wide which I personally think looks unappealing on women. For this reason, I was looking for a more feminine tie. At the same time, I was looking for something that wouldn't break the bank since I will be using this for work.

Well, let me say that I am so happy that I bought this tie! First, it is narrower than most men's ties, making it more attractive for a woman. The design looks a little vintage and classy. Since buying this tie, I have received many compliments on it! The material seems durable and overall it looks much more expensive than it really is.

If you are looking for a more feminine tie that is appropriate for women, I highly recommend this tie! I like it so much that I think I might just order some more in other color variations.

"I ordered and quickly received the Lecmal Economic Affordable Mp3 Music Player - 16 GB (Black)- 1.8 LCD Slim Portable Mp3/Mp4+ Mini USB2.0 Cables. The Lecmal Mp3 Music Player was mailed in a brown card board shipping box with other items I ordered and was delivered to my front door by UPS.  The item is packaged in a small plastic retail box and the Mp3 music Player is packaged in bubble wrap for protection.  This package consist of one (1) MP3 Player, one (1) Earphone, one (1) USB Cable and a user manual.  This Mp3 comes in several colors but I ordered the black one.  This one offers a 16 GB memory card.  The sound on this is incredible and believe it or not comparable to the iPod.  As soon as I got it I connected it via USB to the computer and copied and pasted my music files to it. The download took a little over 10 minutes, not too bad. I was a little nervous to turn it on and see if operating the menu was going to be a nightmare or not and if my songs would be displayed by Album and Artist. I was extremely relieved to find that navigating through the menu was simple and I was able to pick between Artist or Album with no problem. This Mp3 will allow you to carry music, video, photo and files wherever you go.  I would recommend this Mp3 by Lecmal!

"When I received this watch I can't believe how nice looking it is and you can tell it's well made.  The size and design is what i really love with this watch, it's not too small and not too big, it looks great on my wrist.

I have worked with dogs for a long time. I worked at petsmart for a while and gave a few of their anti chew sprays a try so I could recommend the best one to my clients. I found bitter apple works the best but it never really drys. I wanted to find a different spray so I gave this one a try. I like how it is made with tea tree oil so it helps heal hot spots as well as deters your pet from licking. I like how it actually drys too. It did not how ever come with a prayer. I just received a leaking bottle of this. Luckily i have extra bottles at home but I am bummed it did not come with its own sprayer. The smell is pleasant. It stopped my sister in laws dog from licking her stomach. Healed some of the redness. It had to be reapplied many times though. Her dog is an iggy and I had to use almost a half a bottle of this in a week to get her to start to heal. I would recommend this for dogs with hot spots but that is about it. Also make sure you have your own spray bottle. I received this product at a reduced price or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

"Beautiful stainless steel zirconia diamond earrings. They have several different size diamonds within the 6 pairs that you get in the order. They look beautiful on and shine like real diamonds.

"This is a beautiful, lightweight scarf. It's perfect for Florida as it gives a flair to an outfit but is thin enough not to be hot. I ordered the brown and it's a lovely chocolate color run through with multi-color metallic threads. The pleating gives it just enough texture to shimmer. It's fairly short as far as scarves go, 56"" sounds like a lot, but it's really not, especially if you want to do any fancy knots with it.

All in all, I think the scarf would be beautiful in any color and an attractive accessory to go with almost any outfit.

i. easy install leaving no bubbles in the middle
ii. came with no instructions, however instructions were provided on the product's page on Amazon - it the instructions were printed out and included in the packaging, that would be more convenient

iv. there is a line around the edge where the protector fails to adhere with the phone's curved edges

I took a video of me testing the case out in a sink full of water. I put paper in the case instead of my phone, just being cautious in case it didn't work. But it does and its awesome. The case is compatible with all phones that are under 6.7. The device is floatable as well for when you accidentally might drop it while swimming in the pool or ocean. It has an audio jack on the outside of the case to plug your earphones into and the other end of the audio cable is in the case that plugs into your phone. I would only use the audio jack when running or working out. I don't think its meant for the water, obviously. Works perfectly you can speak and hear everything just fine. It also comes with an armband for easy carrying while running. I loved that it comes with an armband. I was able to wear it while working out. Also comes with a lanyard and instruction manual on how to use the case. ITs super easy and simple to open the case. It was a little difficult for me to open the tabs (as you can tell in my video), but thats good that means its safely secured and no water will get in. I highly recommend this product for those who like to carry their phones with them while swimming or at the beach. This would be great while jet skiing. You can have your phone with you to take pictures whenever you stop but it will be protected from the water by keeping it in the case. You can also use this case to protect your ID cards, things like keys, cash and credit cards. Quite useful for those who go to theme parks.
I highly recommend!

Pros
-Waterproof
-Has external audio jack. Great for listening to music during workouts
-Case is big enough to fit most phones, under 4.7
-Comes with armband for easy carrying
-Comes with lanyard for those who don't want to use the armband
-Floats in case you drop in water
-You can still use the touch screen when phone is in case
-Many uses

"I've reviewed over a dozen Bluetooth speakers, and about half of those are intended for rugged outdoor use or exposure to moisture. This particular one is medium-sized and has two 5W speakers for a total of 10W, and performed well in comparison to other 10W speakers I've tested.

This speaker arrived partially charged, but it includes a small USB cable which I was able to use to get it up-and-running in around four hours. It has a red LED light which lit when it was charging, and once it was replaced by a green LED light, it was charged and ready to go. The port for the charging cable as well as the 3.5mm connection are covered with a small piece of rubber which can be used to place over the opening in order to protect the delicate components inside. It also includes an AUX 3.5mm cable as well as a bicycle mount. There is also a removable silicone wrist strap on one of the top corners.

The pairing process was extremely simple, and after I figured out that you have to push and hold to turn it on/off as well as to initiate the pairing process (which initiates a blue LED to start blinking to let you know it is ready to pair with a device), it went very quickly. I was able to locate the device on my phone without any issues and complete the pairing and then get started listening to music right away.

I tested this little speaker with a variety of music, and what I found was that it was a bit tinny, with bass levels that became muddled if you got too loud. It also has loud and jarring audio cues as you do things like turn it on, power it down, or reach max volume.

The package includes:
1x Special Forces-SF470 Bluetooth Speaker
1x Bicycle Mount
1x User Manual
1x USB Charging Cable
1x AUX 3.5mm Audio Cable

It's IP Rated IP65 designed to be waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof, and it comes with a lot of really useful features for the audio enthusiast who is on the go, including a wrist-strap, as well as attachment points for a tripod and bike. The rubberized corners and buttons make it feel very durable, and not something you need to treat as if it will shatter if you look at it the wrong way. This is one of the huge pluses of this Bluetooth speaker in comparison to others I own.

Another plus of this speaker in comparison to others I own is its battery life. It has a built-in li-ion rechargeable battery (2000mAH capacity) for up to 10 hours of playtime. I easily got 7+ hours of use out of it in my tests, which is nearly twice the duration of similar devices I own. Since it connects via a micro USB charge port rather than a DC port, you're also able to charge it with an external battery pack if you're out on the go while camping or at an event. None of my larger speakers offer this charging option.

The only drawback of this Bluetooth speaker is the sound. It's on-par with other 10W Bluetooth speakers I've tested, but not exceptional in terms of audio.

For a mid-sized Bluetooth speaker, it does the job well, and was certainly able to get better audio than my iPhone or other shower speaker, but nowhere near the range of audio quality of some of my other, more expensive Bluetooth speakers. It isn't going to shake any houses with its bass, but it also didn't cut out or break up when I tested music with a lot of bass. It simply didn't produce those ranges and carried on with the ranges it could. Additionally, sometimes when playing back audio via Bluetooth, I would experience momentary drops in audio. This didn't occur often, but it did happen, even when the speaker was quite near to the Bluetooth device I was broadcasting from.

I also appreciated the fact that there were added buttons on the speaker. Being able to pause, resume, or fast-forward your media hands-free away from your phone or other device while you're in the shower or out and about is really awesome, and something I hadn't been able to experience previously. One of the pluses of this model is that the buttons are actually clickable, tactile buttons compared to others I've seen on the market which are triggered simply by touch sensors.

Additionally, you can answer incoming calls by pressing the multi-function button in the center, and you can redial the last dialed number by holding down the same button. While this is useful, you're not able to activate voice dialing (such as Siri) from this speaker, which you can do with a number of similar speakers. This is definitely a feature I would recommend the manufacturer consider adding, because it's quite handy when wanting to voice-dial someone, send a message, or look up information.

Overall, if you're looking for a rugged little mid-sized Bluetooth speaker and are willing to compromise a bit of the sound quality for a much longer battery life and the ability to charge it on the go via USB, this is a great option which I would certainly recommend you consider.

"I will start out my review by saying that I got the Aqua California King Sheets and the color is beautiful! All of the sheets and pillowcases have a uniform color and match perfectly! The quality of these sheets is amazing and the edges are not coming apart and all have uniform and straight edges.
The sheets are extremely soft and fit on my thicker mattress perfectly, being tight but yet not so tight that I can not get the sheets on the mattress. Each pillowcase fits a regular sized pillow, they are not huge pillowcases meant for the very very fluffy pillows, but you can get a large fluffy pillow in the case if you just really push it in, which does tend to make the pillows less fluffy.
The sheet is thin, but you can still feel the sheet on you while using it and it does hold in a little bit of your body heat.
If you are looking for very nice sheets for your bed, I would highly reccomend these sheets, you will not be disappointed.

"I have been looking for a good quality electric grinder at a reasonable price and came across this one.  I love the sleek look of it and the ease at which the one button works.  The only set back is that the lid is hard to get off the first time, make sure you twist the lid and do not pry it off with a knife or you will break the inside seams that allow it to secure in place.  The lid once twisted off you can put the beans or seeds or bark in the cup that you need to grind.  Plug it in, close and push the button.  You can do a course grind with a few pushes of the button or pulse it for a finer grind.  The device itself is very elegant and looks great with any modern kitchen look.  I was surprised at how fast the grinder did the job, I expected it to take some time but really was push push done.  Having fresh ground coffee makes a big difference in the quality and taste of you cup.

"I like these leggings. One of my favorite things about them is the mesh inset on the side - it really makes them stand out from the other yoga leggings in my collection, and I think it makes them a little sexier, not that that really matters when Im lounging around the house in them. It makes me a little hesitant to wear them to a public yoga class because I prefer to be modest in public, but it makes me feel more fierce when I wear them during my home practice. The color is a nice deep black and they make me look and feel slimmer. I got the large and they fit me well. They are nice and snug but not too tight. They don't come up as high as some of my other leggings, which is ok, although I prefer a little higher waist. They sit right above my hips. As far as length goes they are long enough for me, but I cant wear them over my heels (I never wear my leggings like that anyway, but I know some yogis like that). For reference I am 57 and about 145 lbs, with most of my height in my legs, so if you're not long legged like me they will fit you longer. I generally wear a medium in bottoms so I would recommend sizing up. The leggings stay in place well whatever Im doing, and I don't feel like I have to hike them up a lot. They seem a little warmer than some of my workout leggings, which makes me like them a little less. The fabric doesnt breathe as well or something. Overall I like them though, and I am sure Ill get a lot of use out of them.

"I was able to try out these shoes for free in exchange for an honest review via BzAngent, and I have to say, I'm very disappointed.
Normally, Stride Rite is our go-to brand.  However, these fit differently than most of their sneakers do.  First of all, they are much narrower.  We typically order a wide, but I'm not even sure if at XW would have worked in these.  VERY NARROW.  Also, the style of the tongue is bulky/off.  Maybe my son's arches are just REALLY high, but the fit between where the laces end, and the strap begins is oddly placed, and the strap can barely stretch over the overly-padded tongue.
SR missed the mark on the design of this shoe.  Which is too bad, because the color and material is great for summer.",1
"I will be honest here I was iffy about ordering this and worried about sizing, but my daughter really really wanted it so I crossed my fingers and ordered it... We are both so happy I did! I ordered the xl for my almost 6 year old who wears a a size 6 american and it fit her perfect. The material is beautiful and she loves the way her ""fins"" reflect the light! When she tried it on she said ""Mommy I'm beautiful like Princess Ariel!"". Thank you so much for this awesome swimsuit and making my baby girl so so happy! I can not wait to get the one I ordered for her older sister to get here! I'm sure it will be just as amazing as this one and she will love it just as much as her sister loves hers.

"If you own cats...you may want to consider getting this.  My cat are well trained...but I refurnished our rooms and I was forced to move the cat box.  Well...the cats didn't take too well to the move, so I had to get this to prevent them from using that spot as a cat box.  Honestly worked very well.  It creates a smell that cats hate, so they avoid that spot.  I don't use much of it...just in that spot, and it works.  I'm not sure if it works for keeping the strays away, but it worked for me.

"To me this Bluetooth speaker looks robotic and futuristic. When you turn the speaker on the first thing you hear is a voice telling you that it is in control and that you cannot resist it's command. O.O  It reminds me of the voice announcements you hear as you get closer to boarding an amusement park ride, or the intro to that old TV series ""The Outer Limits."" I get a bit of a giggle when I hear it.

Along the sides of this cube shaped speaker there are squares, the squares light up along the edges in shades of red, blue, and green,...which adds to it's look. The control buttons are on the bottom along with the power switch. Unless you have the eyesight of an eagle, don't even bother trying to read the instruction manual, you will find it too frustrating. The buttons are easy to press, but I had to angle it a bit to catch the light so I could see what button does what. Once you figure out what each button does you can navigate pretty easily using long and short presses.

I like the way music sounds through the top facing speaker, it didn't sound tinny and I didn't hear any distortion whatsoever when turned up all the way. There is a slot along the side for an SD card as well as a AUX plugin and charging port, cables are included. The FM radio works, but it has a hard time staying tuned into a channel. The Bluetooth works great though, no problems pairing up and for such a small speaker it filled our living room with sound.

You can also use this for a hands free speakerphone, unfortunately since the markings on the bottom make it hard to see which button does what there is a good chance you'll miss the call by the time you figure out which button to press. I personally like easier marked, and better accessed control buttons.

I think kids would like this speaker, it's loud enough to bug their parents, and the shape, along with the light up squares, would look great in any room. With the AUX cable they can plug right into the side of a laptop for richer sounding movies as well.

"We have integrated so many computing devices in our lives. A current challenge is to provide them with power. For instance, in my current office, I have 3 monitors, 1 docking station, a set of speakers, 1 phone, 1 power Bluetooth headset, 1 router, 1 micro cell tower for my cell phone, and 1 fax machine. Every now and then, I also want to charge my cell phone. You can see how a simple office desk has so many computing devices that require power.
We now have the responsibility to shield these devices from surges in electric power. One way that I used to do this is by having various surge protectors. Unfortunately, they would all connect from the same outlet.
The surge protector Aukey 6-port 43W/8A USB charger with 8 outlet and quick charge 3.0 USB port has not solved my issues. It has however provided me with some relief. This surge protector has several good things going for it. Here are my favorites:
8-Outlet surge protector with a 5-foot cord surge protector and 6-Port USB ports ideal for powering 14 devices simultaneously, and protecting your electronics from surges and spikes. AUKEY AiPower Adaptive Charging Technology - up to 2.4A per USB port.
This is ideal for me. It removes the need for daisy chains which are not recommended. This surge protector is so good that you can also use it outside of the office. The charger is equally fast in charging non-compatible smart phones and tablets with its 5V/5A maximum current. It is also suitable for your home and office electrical appliances, computers, laptops, printers, modems, speakers and more.
In addition, it does not only charge, it charges fast. The fastest charging technology, 38% more efficient than Quick Charge 2.0. And more efficiency makes less heat when charging.
Furthermore, the keyhole slots on the back of the power strip allow you to mount it on the wall or baseboard. Two widely spaced AC outlets accommodate large power adapters or chargers.
This power strip is now in my office. I like it and I would recommend it to anyone.

"The light is impressive, in quality, details and brightness.  We loved that it was very bright.  The picture I included is the brightest setting.  I got this light for my husband.  We've mostly been using it on my son's bike for night bike rides.  It works very well.  Even the lowest setting is still bright.  The plastic rings included a bit of a longer edge, which helped with grip when installing.  This is one of the details that makes a product of higher quality in my opinion, it makes me think they put more thought in the product.  The installation was easy and can be easily removed to add to my husband's bike.  It does have options for low, medium and high.  On our bike path, we mostly used the high beam. It did end up getting a little hot.  This was in 100 degree weather.

This bike light is probably not for those that want to eliminate every possible ounce from their bikes, as it is a little on the side of heavy.

Aside from the heat it can produce, all three of us love this light.  It has many light options, wear on your head, brightness, etc.  Overall, a great bright light.

"This collar is great.  It is thick, but not bulky. I have a 100lb lab and he has a tendency to pull on occasion.  We used this on an adventure and had no problems with it. It moves easily around the neck.  The under side of the collar is smooth and soft.  Where the buckle connects there is a section of leather that goes under the metal buckle part for comfort. My dog wasn't bothered by it all and he has a tendency to start scratching at new collars.  Not this one!  The ring where the ID tags attach is large and broad in width. It has rivets of sorts, 2 on each side of the ring.  It looks as though it will keep it in place and not be torn off the collar.  The size I have is a 16-20 inch size Large, which just fits.  I would consider getting the extra large to have a bit more wiggle room for adjustment.  Seriously a great looking and very functional collar .  I would recommend it!!

"This is definitely a super cute and super girly case. My case doesn't look exactly like the picture but instead it's white with maybe rose gold stripes I can't really tell what color it is but it has like a metallic look to it. This is definitely a hard case which is good for protection but it also has a soft case layered underneath it. With this case you can still see the Apple in the center which I think looks very nice and has a nice touch. This case looks good on your phone when you're looking at your phone from the front and from the back. I get plenty of compliments on this case number frequently asked where I got it from. This is a dual-layer case however when I go out I usually have both layers of the case attached. I think it just looks much better that way.

"SUPER BRIGHT! When I opened the box for this I thought ""how bright could this be? It looks like one small LED light inside."" I plugged the light into the battery and made a huge mistake. I looked directly at the light and turned it on. WOW! I severely underestimated the power of this light! I literally almost fell off my chair in shock! After I regained sight in my right eye and composure I went through and checked out the light in more detail. Here's what I found...

BRIGHTNESS: ridiculous!! It has to be as bright or brighter than a vehicle's headlight. In the full sun day-lit office this thing looked bright. At home in the dark it was seriously a shock how bright this thing is. I could actually use this as a defense against a robber in the middle of the night. It would blind them!

FUNCTIONALITY: The battery pack is separate from the light and attaches with a cable. The battery comes in a cloth case that has velcro to attach to a bike frame. There is then a cable that attaches to the light or the power block to charge it. So the light can stay fixed to the bike even when charing the battery. The back of the light is well thought out as well. There are 2 buttons that are backlit so you can see them in the dark. The left button turns on a ring of LED's that cast a nice glow if you don't want the full headlight on. When you press that button again the ring starts strobing, adding more safety to your night-time bike riding. The right button turns on the SUPER BRIGHT headlight. It can be on while the ring is on/flashing. You can also press the headlight button 2 more times giving you 3 brightness settings.

QUALITY: Every part of this product is made out of quality material. The buttons feel solid and I believe they will hold up to long-term use. The power cable is a decent gauge and feels like it will hold up long-term without breaking or fraying. The cable has a screw on hold as well to help support it and give it a longer life. When holding it and squeezing around the edges there is not any noise indicating loose construction. Everything feels tight and solid! It also comes with a nice head attachment with thick elastic bands and it has a nice tight fit. (I did not try putting the light on the head attachment...I imagine the external battery would be a bit heavy on my head!).

OVERALL IMPRESSION: I love this thing! It's impressively bright, useful in many situations (biking, camping, security). I recently DJ'd a wedding reception outdoors and I had to tear down in the dark...I wish I would have had this thing! It would have lit up the whole area and it doesn't take up hardly any packing space because it's so small. I recommend this 100% for anyone looking for a small light that is durable and BRIGHT!!!!

All of my reviews are 100% honest whether I like the product or not. Happy shopping!",1

"I have been looking for a bathroom rug for quite some time. Before,  I would wipe my feet on a towel before wearing my slippers, not always comfortable balancing leg at a time in the bathtub.  Kara Clark memory bathroom rug is very well made. First of all, the back of the rug has a rubberized, non slip surface - perfect for tiled floors.  Secondly, the memory foam material feels luxurious on my feet and soaks in some of the wetness.  Love the pink color too.  It goes well with my Hello Kitty shower curtains.

A few tips, the huge care label on the back has to be constantly tucked in if you want to move the rug.  Perhaps a smaller label placed not so close to the edge would be more convenient.  Do they allow a tear off label?  Also don't worry about the rug being folded in half in the packaging, it slowly goes flat.  This rug was given to me at a promotional rate for my honest and unbiased review.  If you find this review helpful, please click yes below.",1
"This receiver is so small and easily fits into the palm of my hand. It was super easy to connect to my Galaxy S6, and I really  liked how it is clearly labeled as a GE Audio Receiver. Many of my other Bluetooth devices are not so clearly labeled, and it can be a bit of a guessing game. The receiver comes with a detailed instruction kit, complete with illustrations. I had a question, and got a super fast emailed response from the product owner. Unfortunately, when I purchased this, I did not realize that this is only a receiver, and needs to be connected to a stand alone speaker system. I do not own a speaker system, so was unable to test out that particular part of the device. I did attempt unsuccessfully to connect it to a flat screen TV.

"Mine is an old review.  Take it for whatever it's worth....  Before making this purchase my previous home home phone was a Panasonic.  Then one of my cats knocked on of the handsets into a sink full of water.  I could never again, even buying another handset on ebay, get the old system to work.  So I purchased this model.  Never a problem (sans a handset getting knocked into a sink full of water).  BUT...

Since this relatively recent purchase, I have given up my home phone telephone line.  I wish I had thought it through and ""cut the cord"" on my home phone line prior to this purchase.of this fine Panasonic product.  BEFORE YOU BUY: consider cutting the cord on your home phone.  AFTER YOU BUY: don't place any of the handsets in a position where your furry friends/family members can knock them into a pool of water.",0
"I have always wanted copper mugs for Moscow mules and this gift set by copper natural was perfect.  The Cooper mugs look stunning and are a beautiful decorative addition as well.  They are sturdy and great quality.  After some use they will naturally tarnish which is a good thing and can actually have health benefits so you can just leave the tarnish or buff it out and make it shiny and new again.  It came with the original recipe for Moscow mules and then there are several other recipes which are very good which you get in a email.  Loved all of them but I am still a huge fan of the original recipe.  These mugs make for a super cold refreshing drink on a hot day.  I will get more of these as gifts for friends.

"We have two Tervis cups that we use a lot - they are the larger 24 oz ones that taper in a bit at the bottom.  Like these:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tervis-Tumbler-Gerber-Daisy-24-oz-with-Travel-Lid-Clear/dp/B00DHLT4B0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tervis Tumbler, Gerber Daisy, 24 oz with Travel Lid, Clear</a>. We use them a ton in the summer for water and when we eat outside since the lids slide shut.

I wanted a handle to make them easier when working outside in the garden.  Dirty hands and big cups don't always mix but I thought having a handle would help that.  I was right!  These handles are terrific.  They fit the big Tervis cups nicely with the smaller ring on the bottom gripping the cup nicely and the top on stabilizing the handle.  The bottom has an absorbent/springy ring that helps to hold the cup.

The handles are comfortable, they keep my cups from getting too dirty when my hands are a mess and they are easy on, easy off.  No downsides to these!

They are really good for the price they are listed for. 2 hours of charging gives you 6 hours of  battery life which alone is great. It also has a cool function that my other bluetooth earphones don't. That is that you can connect to two devices simultaneously. I have it connected to my laptop and my phone at the same time and I can pause the video on my laptop and continue listening to music on my phone. That is pretty cool. The connection is kept really well. In an open area I can walk away from my phone at 25 feet and I get a great connection with no interference. I can walk 15 feet away with a wall in my way at 7 feet and still retain a stable connection. It has a great build and weighs very little at 12.7 grams and because its light weight when I am using them the control module doesn't drag down. This earphones come with a few earbud pieces from large to small so you can find the perfect fit. Compared to the QY11 earphones that they have it feels a bit more comfortable for me and I would wear them longer. That is just me though it all depends on how your ears are, but for me this are very good. They also have some spare ear hooks that keep the earphones secure in your ears. I have been using this at the gym and the sound is really good. It gets pretty loud and can get subtle for when you're in a quiet room. One of the things I would like to see on this earphones would be a magnetic back. That would make it perfect for me as it would make it easier for it to stay on my neck when not in use and not be falling back.

"I bought this item because it said it works on flies, but when I got it I a was disappointed to see it was labeled as a rodent/owl repeller. So I  put it in the garage because I have never seen rodents on my property but I have found a few telltale droppings around my storage shelves in the garage. I have been using it for about a week now and I have no complaints so far. I was worried that my dogs would be disturbed by it but that hasn't happened either. It emits a sound that I cannot hear and doesn't seem to bother the dogs either. Since I haven't seen or heard any activity I feel like I can't exactly attest to its effectiveness yet, but I also haven't noticed any new droppings or signs of any critters. So hopefully that means it's working and my garage has become a less hospitable environment for them.... But today I was sitting out on the patio and the flies were driving me crazy as usual and I thought, ""well why don't I just go get that thing and give it a try out here...?""

And as soon as i plugged it in there was a fly right next to me so I thought of course that's not going to work, but for the next half-hour I was out there, I didn't have a fly come near me!!! Oh my goodness if it's true I will be my husbands hero!!! So far so good! I'm going to but a few more!!!

"So I like most people never put much thought io light bulbs, I just assumed they were all similar, with the exception of some of those energy saving ones that take FOREVER TO TURN ON and always cost more, plus the lighting is never as bright as you would like. Well, let me tell you my mind has been changed! Lightbulbs have definitely been upgraded for the better!

So I got a sample of these lightbulbs  a soft white and a daylight. For those of you who don't know/remember the difference (like me!) between those two, have no fear since I have included a photo.

So the one thing I noticed right of the bat, is these things are super robust/less fragile feeling than any other light bulb that I have owned. This was an A+ for me, I have a toddler and pets that run around my house and the fear of breaking this is much less when compared to your normal bulb.

The other thing that in found SO SO FASCINATING is after leaving it on for awhile, the bulb doesn't over hear and burn you. I can't count how many times I've had my fingers burned touching a lightbulb. Once again, with my toddler going through the, ""touch everything"" stage this helps put my mind at ease.

This daylight bulb is incredibly bright! This would for me personally be great for whatever room you are putting your makeup on. This would definitely give you a better view of what you will look like when you walk out that door, no more of that false daylight bulbs that you have been using, giving you false hopes that all that time you spent contouring and highlighting your face looks natural. Now you can actually do your makeup inside and look normal when you walk outside! Trust me I switched out one of my bathroom light bulbs, and it truly made a difference for the better! ",1

"This is a review of a free product received from TP-LINK as part of the review program.

My review is not biased and I do a lot of product reviews in different places across the internet.

I had reviewed the AC1200 wi-fi router earlier and many of the good things about that router are similar to this one. You can refer to that review for more details here: https://www.amazon.com/review/R3AJS6HQ0ZDD1G/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm

The following are the ways in which the AC3150 is better than the AC1200:

1) The wifi signal quality is fantastic and the signal range is fantastic too. It is clearly better than the AC1200.

2) The bandwidth supported by the ac3150 is clearly much better than the ac1200.

3) Intranet bandwidth : This is quite excellent. The AC1200 as I had stated earlier provided a total bandwidth of 1167Mbps across multiple frequencies. When I was using 5GHz, I could not get more than 7-8MB/s while doing file transfers over intranet. But I think this is good for a non-power user. However, on the ac3150, I could easily get >20MB/s comfortably (reached up to 25MB/s). This is due to the fact that it has a USB 3.0 port plus it has a much higher bandwidth on its 5GHz frequencies. Users who do not need 4K media streaming without lags or jitters within their network should definitely try out the AC3150. You cannot get that with the ac1200. However, if its normal web browsing and social media is the requirement the AC1200 should be ok.

4) Connectivity options: USB 3.0 Vs USB 2.0

5) FTP transfer rate for ac3150 was 2x that of ac1200. Clearly much better speeds..

6) The AC3150 is the pricier device - almost twice the price. But it is perfect for gamers and high definition media consumers.

Other features:

1. The router allows you to setup and create your own virtual private networks.

2. Sharing of storage through the wifi USB port can be secured through authentication and it works perfectly fine from the internet.

3. As stated previously, the mobile app allows you to control all devices accessing the network and also set bandwidth (QoS) controls for each client which is really cool.

Summary: This is one of the best ""high-end"" routers in the market with significant performance headroom. Users who need high quality video streaming or avid gamers will find this a very good investment. I would not recommend this router for beginners or very light users of network.",1
"These Men's undershirts are of great quality. They consist of soft fabric, and fit as expected. They're designed well and come in 6 assorted colors. Which could also go great with any workout gear. I originally ordered these shirts for my boyfriend but I often end up wearing them as a workout shirt. They're quite comfortable and fit me quite well. I definitely recommend these shirts to everyone due to the great quality of these tank top shirts.

"I bought this for my youngest daughter because my older one had gotten one as a gift. It is so cute in person and even though it fits a little big, she wears it all of the time.

"I have had a few waterproof cases for phones and they have all been pretty much the same. They all have a cord for hanging it around your neck. That setup works for a lot of situations but the dangling pouch can get in the way in certain cases. And those pouches hanging from your neck can even be dangerous because they can get snagged on something and throw you off balance. This BPS Wallet Belt is different. The waist belt keeps the pouch close to your body so it is unlikely to cause a problem.

Keep in mind that this pack is not just for watersports like surfing but can be useful for a lot of outdoor activities that have the potential for getting wet ... that includes just being caught out in the rain on a gentile walk.

The pouch's waist belt has an OK adjustment range (up to 45""?) for fitting the skinny as well as the slightly chubby.

"I am looking to have a back up, soon to be replacement for my current waist trainer. The price was right on this one so I wanted to give it a try. I was drawn to this one because it was breathable, my other one is not breathable at all & that's a negative for me. I examined it well when it showed up. It's very stretchy, the boning in it if very flexible & it has three rows of hooks. I put it on & it is very breathable which I love for the summertime especially & it fits well. The material is a little itchy to me....I'm not sure if that's because I'm not used to it or if it's just scratchy material. I'm pleased with it so far.

I received the Premium Dual Sided Professional Dematting Comb and Grooming Rake a couple of days ago.  I immediately used it on my Springer Spaniel and within moments had handfuls of hair.  It would take me about 30 minutes brushing him to get the same amount of hair that I did in less then 10 minutes I spent using this tool.  This tool has two different size blades and I found with the Springer's hair using the larger blade it glided with ease through the matts and hair.  The smaller blade seemed to tug on his hair more than the larger blade. My Springer's fur looked clean and shiny once I was done using the  de-matting tool.  My dog appeared to enjoy the experience and never once complained when I ran across a matt in his fur.  I purchased this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review of the product.,1
"Before I review these shoes, let me begin by saying I have NOT yet wore them in the river or gone creek walking with them. The weather as of late has been rainy and we have mud everywhere. However, I have wore them quite a bit (about 8 hours over 3 days) around the house and around town shopping and they are quite comfortable.

I really like these shoes! The shoes shipped quickly as promised and came in a plastic white large envelope for shipping. The shoes probably had things sitting on them throughout shipping so the shoes needed to be put on to achieve normal shape. I don't think this caused any issues with the true shape of the shoe and seemed to shape out perfectly after first wear. I

I wear a 8 1/2 shoe depending upon the manufacturer. So, not knowing how these fit (size-wise), I went with the size I wear in my Nike's which is an 11. The 11 fits perfectly so if you've ever worn a Nike, that's the size to order. While they are the perfect length, if you have a wide food, you might find these a bit uncomfortable. I have an average width foot and they are nice and snug.

The shoes have mesh uppers with varying size holes in the sole and a mesh insert to allow water but no rocks through. They appear to be well made with solidly attached/glued seams. The toes and heels are re-inforced with what could be neoprene or or some synthetic leather and is sewn in to the main construction of the shoe.

The shoes are well made and seem that they will last for a long time. If I am able to get 3-5 years out of the wear, I would buy another pair with no issues at the price point provided. I like that the soles are able to drain and do not hold water as some water shoes do. The sole is flexible from the middle to the toe of the shoe. Not so much from the middle to the heel, but this is expected with most shoes.

They have a slight arch but nothing overly supportive. They have tabs on the tongue and heel to assist in putting on.

"Rating: 4/5

What I Like:
-Decent audio in the mids/treble
-Solid waterproof build quality
-Looks and feels rugged
-Nice included lanyard
-Loud maximum volume

What I Don't Like:
-Bass lacks oomph at quiet volumes
-Connect & pairing sounds are too loud

-------

Build Quality & Appearance: Im a big fan of the rugged look and to me this speaker looks great. It has a nice balance between strength and size, as it is fairly streamlined. The entire speaker is coated in a solid rubber and all the ports are covered with waterproof caps. The speaker has a bit of heft to it and the weight is quite heavy. It feels solid in my grip. There are no noticeable gaps or edges in the rubberized coating and everything is solidly in place. The speaker is slightly smaller than I expected  but feels overall well made.

Audio Quality: In terms of audio quality, this speaker has a noticeable edge towards mids and high tones. It results in clear and detailed sound, though at times I find myself wanting for more bass. Those who like classical and soft rock music will enjoy this speaker the most, as well as those who priority clarity over booming bass. Its a size limitation more than anything, and in my opinion this is one of the better sounding speakers at its pricepoint. One thing I noticed is how loud the speaker can get. I was able to max out the volume without distortion, and it was too loud for me to comfortably listen to in my bedroom without disturbing my landlords. At higher volumes the sound is richer than low volumes, and the bass gets heavier as if it is curved for more impact when the speaker is turned up. This is a little disappointing becuase high volumes show what the speakers drivers are capable of, but at moderate to low volumes the bass is too quiet.

Battery Life: Battery performance is excellent with this speaker. I clocked in at least 10 hours of constant music at a middle volume level. Thats essentially an entire day of listening for the average person.

Connectivity & Signal: One thing I like about this speaker is how far the Bluetooth goes. I found that it would stay connected even with a wall between myself and the speaker. With line of sight, I got about 30 feet before it started to occasionally stutter, and as soon as I stepped outside of my house it started to break up.

Other Notes: The included lanyard is made from silicone or rubber and is far stronger than ones made from cloth. When the speaker connects and disconnects from a Bluetooth device, the confirmation sounds it makes are extremely loud and there is no way to turn them down.

Conclusion: Overall I found this speaker to have decent sound performance and a strong build. The only thing that would push it to a higher rating would be a bit more bass at quiet volumes.

"I received the three piece set: strainer, turner, and spoon. It also came with a bonus gift: a thing you can attach to the side of your pot to hold a utensil. This is my first set of silicone utensils, and so far I'm extremely pleased.
PROS:
1) Does not scratch my nonstick cookware.
2) They are extremely heat resistant. I had no problem-even in my iron skillet.
3) They are dishwasher safe. I even washed them in the bottom rack.
4)The handles are soft and ergonomic. This is a big plus for my arthritic hands.
5) They are bright and colorful.
Cons:
1) The angle of the spatula is a little awkward(reason for subtracting a star).
2) They are a little on the heavy side.

"Today I used my bamber french rolling pin. First I like to tell you how this comes packaged. Mine rolling pin came in a large padded envelope. When I opened the package I found the rolling pin to be In shrink wrap. I like to find product's that I buy in shrink wrap, usually this means no one else has used it. After I take the shrink wrap off I washed it with soap and water. I found that the rolling pin easy to wash and so soft. This is my first french rolling pin. I have always used a wooden rolling pin and mine has handles and is much heavier than the french rolling pin. When using the french rolling pin you are closer to the dough. I'm using it to make pie dough so this is a little bit to get used to but seems to be working well. Also worked well with my cookie dough. The hardest thing I would have to say is how much pressure I need to apply. I think I would need a longer one for pizza dough though. The French rolling pin I have is approximately 13 or 14 inches without measuring it. I will continue to play with mine and update if I find anything negative about this rolling pin. I gave the rolling pin a five star because it did perform a little better than mine when rolling out the pie dough

"My first product Stopped working after 2-3 days. USB ports stopped working. I returned and got refund from Amazon.
After a month a found mail from Bestten. It seems they tried to contact me multiple times and previous ones went to junk folders.
They offered me to try their new products for free. I was interested in this same product as I liked its feature set and requested it.
This time I am using it for last one month and it is working fine. Best features of this product are
1) 4 USB ports. Not many products in this category have 4 USB ports. These free up electric sockets.
2) Phone holders. There are two. One can handle thicker phone (with cover) and other needs slim phone)

Phone holders when pulled out will get tilted but holds phone fine. I use both of them and short USB cables. This avoids clutter.
I was going to take one star off for phone holders not being that good but for this price with 4 USB ports and 3 electric sockets, it deserves 5 stars.",1

I love these. They are super easy to apply. I attached the first set no problem. When I went to open the 2nd strip one of the magnets fell out. I contacted the seller and they promptly sent me a replacement. I have them both installed. There were no directions on how far apart to space them, and I ended up putting the strips to close together and now the bottles touch and kinda lean. Once you stick the strip on, there is no getting it off!!! Holds the bottles great and is very strong! No bottles fell yet!",1

"I bought this for my husbands phone, he is pretty rough with his phones and so I wanted to get him superior protection.  He has one of those glass screen protectors on it and still managed to break that, luckily the phone screen didn't break but now we have to get a new protector.  I like this case because it actually surrounds the whole phone while in the holster, the screen is completely protected and all he has to do is be careful not to drop it when taking it out or talking on it.  Even so he has still dropped it but so far the phone has not sustained any damage while being in the case.  The phone is fully functional while in the case and everything lines up perfectly, it does not effect the quality of call or photos when using the camera.  It has a very handy clip that can attach to a belt or just a pocket, he actually attaches it to the pouch of a hoodie and it stays right in place.

"Even after fully charging it via outlet it wouldn't fully charge even one cellphone. I have another power bank (not solar) but it will charge around 4 devices before it needs recharging. It took 2 full days of intense sun to charge up to the 4 bars and then would only charge one cellphone to only 50% before it was depleted.

"We decided to leave cable/satellite and opt for more affordable tv options.  We use a few live streaming options, and then we decided to buy this antenna for local programming.
This was pretty easy to install.  My husband watched 1 youtube video and got the idea.  It was installed quite quickly and easily and worked right off the bat. So, I would suggest watching  video if you have never installed an antenna before to make the process easier. This is a decent size, but it is not really large of unsightly.  It is installed in the sort where out old satellite dish was, and it does not stand out more than that.  It is quite a bit small then the old school ones that I remember as a child.
The quality of the picture is quite good!  It really works very well and we were quite surprised at how many channels we get and how well they ""come in"".  We  have been quite pleased!  I would recommend this antenna to anybody that wants tv w/o wanting to pay for cable or satellite services.  This is a great affordable option that was not hard to install and works quite well.

"I have been making cakes poorly for years. I decided that I wanted to step up my game so I watched some videos and made a list of essentials I needed to buy. I did a price check on the things I needed and promptly gave up. It is a really expensive hobby. At the time, I hadn't even considered starter kits. I was just dejected after seeing the price of things.

When I came across this set, I decided to give it a shot. It had most of the stuff on my list and some stuff I had no clue about. Plus, the price is worlds better than buying the things individually.

This set is really ideal for beginners. It has plenty of stuff to play with and is easy to use. The quality is on par with the price but the bits are still very functional. I was a bit rough with some parts and it seemed to handle it very well. The pieces are plastic but are still decent.

Overall, I had a lot of fun making a huge mess and creating all sorts of fun things. I have a birthday coming up and I am excited to be able to make something well above my usual ""cake, but only technically"" quality.

"I have 3 girls who love tights. One problem they seem to have is getting them completely over their feet. The girls loved getting these in the mail. Immediately they put them on. The tights feel a little softer then other brands and the colors were nice, but only after 2 hours of the girls wearing them inside our home I had two out of the three rip. One pair ripped in the knee and the other started to fray at the bottom of one of the legs. I am uncertain of how the whole in the knee got there and questioning the girls was useless because I never get a straight answer, but the other pair that frayed at the bottom clearly looks like the stitching came loose. We have had a lot of tights and all of them have lasted better than these. These tights will be really good of anyone just looking to dress up their little girls once in awhile for something special, but if your girls love to wear them day in and day out then I would pick a different brand.

"This a decent beginners' juicer. It isn't gorgeous to look at but it manages to make quick work of carrots, tangerines, lemons and apples. The motor did not strain for the harder veggies. Since this is a juice extractor the end product is pulp free. That does mean that you get a fine mesh metal filter filled with pulp.

As with any juicer there are myriad parts to clean once you are done. The grater portion is seriously sharp so do be careful when removing that.  The manual states that the parts are best cleaned in the dishwasher and, due to their shape and size, do take up quite a bit of room. Even after running the grater/filter through a wash the pulp did not get removed from the mesh. My dishwasher does not have issues getting things clean at all but the pulp from oranges really stuck tight to the metal filter. I would recommend using a brush to scrape out the fibers from the filter before using the dishwasher.

The one thing I really did not like is the mechanism for separating the top half of the juicer in order to remove the grater. You pry it off at the indents on the sides. There is only enough room for your thumb and a finger to get in there - one pushes down and the other pushes up. When the mechanism releases, it does so with a bit of a pop and the first two times I did this it ended up shooting off the base and splattering pulp on the counter and backsplash. I learned fast to really take it slow when doing this. I've used other juicers that have a built in lever to unhinge the two parts and that would really have been helpful here. Of course, those juicers cost more than twice of what this one does so it really does provide good value for the money.",1

For such an adapter, this would be normally just fine, except for the fact that this adapter has a USB Mini plug that is labelled 'Power'. I understand that not all devices need to be powered, but if you are going to make an adapter, using and older technology, then at least provide the ac adapter. The description states ""External Power Supply via Micro B-5V power port"" is needed for high power devices.
The usage of USB Mini is a problem since nearly everything today uses USB Micro, (with USB-C starting to arrive). Unfortunately, I don't have a old cable that I could utilize. Luckily when I plugged the adapter into my laptops' display port and hooked a monitor to it, it immediately mirrored my laptop. Hit Win+P and changed to extended view. Plugged a second monitor into the adaptor and it mirrored what was displayed on the other monitor.
The device seems to work well enough. I am still only giving it 4 stars for the lack of documentation, and the lack of a power cable. If you offer a port to power the unit, then you should include the ac adapter to power it. Or at the very least, use current connecting technology. Searching for a compatible ac adapter of a previous generation proves to be almost as expensive as this device itself.
I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for product testing and a fair and unbiased review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and received no incentives or rewards for doing so. My goal is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer to increase sales. My remarks are sincere and true. I work very hard trying to write insightful and thoughtful reviews for each item. My goal is ensure that these reviews are helpful to others. My opinions are my own and I thoroughly believe in keeping the integrity of Amazon reviews legitimate to help the community make the best choices. It is just my own opinion and experience with the product, your own opinion and experience may vary. I received no monetary compensation and I am not required to give a good review. Just looking at my public profile and you will see I don't hand out many 5 star reviews. They need to be earned for me to recommend a product regardless of the price I paid.

The light itself is good notwithstanding you have to press the switch multiple times to reach the off position even after having it on for however long. My real gripe though is with the strap which stretched out beyond a useful length within a few short months of occasional use. I eventually had to fold up the excess strap length and staple it just to be able to still use the light.,0
"I cannot get over how amazingly beautiful these dresses are! They are absolutely gorgeous, and fit so well! They are really long too! I am 5'10"" and these dresses touch the floor. With shoes on, they will look perfect. I am thinking they are made a little long so that people can hem them up. They are gorgeous colors and sewed very well. I was so pleased and I love the color selection! The zipper is made well and zips easily too. Overall, you would be crazy not to purchase at least one of these dresses. They are affordable and beautiful!

"Another great case by Caseology. A nice slick and slim case that can fit in and out of your pocket or purse with out catching on anything. Minor downside to this would be the grip of the phone, not super slippery but could be an issue for some. Buttons are all labeled with small symbols indicating their purpose that isn't noticeable but a nice touch.

Quality: The clear rubber backing of the case is well cut and fits well against the harder plastic around the outside. The buttons make a satisfying click when pressed, and that makes a world of difference when compared to other cases where it is difficult to press down. The cutout for all the ports are well sized and large enough for what the ports are intended to do. Headphone jack is also large enough for thicker headphone jacks that may be thicker then the thin stock apple headphones.

Design: Clean look that gets a lot of attention, but is not all in your face. The modern design of the case is simple and well put together. No super sharp edges on the phone either, it's all smooth and feels good in the hands. There is a lip on the glass side of the phone that keeps the phones glass from contacting the surface when placed face down. The hard plastic is also raised up above the clear rubber backing so that it doesn't get scuffed when placed on the back side either. Plastic is also raised up around the camera lens very high to protect the camera lens from scratching.

Color: The clear backing of the case allows you to see the already beautiful design of the iPhone body underneath. The gold coloring of the border is very similar to the gold iPhone color and compliments the phone well. Looks like it was a case made by Apple.

Packaging: Came in a nice slick box that showed the case through the front plastic. Came with a couple of flyers by Caseology about different email subscription programs they are offering. The case I ordered came with two clear stickers on the front and back of the clear part to protect the clear rubber from scratches in shipment. The stickers was difficult to pull off, but after trying for a while I was able to get them off.

Overall a great case, I would recommend.

Toaster works great. Added size for texas toast/bagels. So far so gooooood!,0
"This is a Khaki outdoor sun hat that also can look like a cowboy hat so is perfect for the rancher or cowboy at heart.  It comes in several colors but I purchased the khaki one so it would match everything when I husband was working outside.

The hat is lightweight and made well out of mix of polyester and cotton. The hat breathes and does not hold the sweaty smell as some hats do. There is a snap on both sides that you snap up to look like the cowboy hat. I personally did not like it as I felt it stretched the hat and made it look all out of proportion. It was very strange looking so we kept the snaps undone.

The hat fit my husband who is six foot and 250 pounds well It was not too big nor too small. There is a string to tighten to keep on in case you are on lawn equipment or something of that nature. It is a nice looking hat and very fashionable as well as handy to work in.

"So, for the price I paid I do like this item.  It is perfect for me since I seldom take my eyes off my computer screen - now I can post reminders on my screen easily in a way that is neat and organized, like my anal retentive self appreciates :)

The brush is great too, as I hate looking for one of those wipes every time I need to clean my computer screen.

The only negative things that I have to say about this set is that I wish I was able to attach the message board to either side of my monitor ... but unfortunately the adhesive tape was already attached to the left hand side of the message board, meaning that it will only go on the right hand side of your monitor.  Also, for some reason I thought the mini post it notes would come with the set, which they didn't.  I don't know why I thought this - and it would be unfair of me to subtract points for this - but it seems like a very inexpensive thing to add to the set which would increase the perceived value substantially.

"This sweet little leotard was perfect for my daughter's very first ballet outfit.  We only paid $6.40 for the set, so I feel we got beyond our money's worth.  The tiara broke at the hands of my 3 year old, that being said it is a plastic tiara. I could see it lasting had she not treated it the way she did.  The tutu is simple 2 layer tulle, nothing fancy but does exactly what it is supposed to do...look adorable.  My daughter is in 4/5 and I would say this fits a bit snug for the labeled size.  The leg holes are a bit snug, but it's hard to review for fitting.

A cute starter kit to get a first timer to feel special!",0
"I really like these tights. They appear to be made very well, the material feels nice, the style looks good. They have a small zippered pocket in the back that I like a lot. My one and only complaint is the size, they are really small. I am 5'6"" and I weigh 130 lbs. I ordered a size medium and when they arrived I opened the package and held up the pants and I tell you they looked 10-12 inches wide. I thought I wouldn't even be able to get them on. But I was wrong about that, I got them on and they do fit, kind of, they are really tight (I know they are compression pants but OMg, they are tight)

So, I really like these pants but my advice to anyone ordering them is to consider ordering a size larger than you usually do. They are compression tights (again, I get that) but they are VERY tight.

Most flashlights are either Flood lights or Spot lights. This flashlight is neither any of those, it has a super wide beam of light, it has a much more wider coverage than a flood light. When I saw the photo of a person standing in front of a commercial building wall using this flashlight, I was like no way is that possible to get such a wide beam from a small flashlight.

You are getting exactly what is pictured and while this will work for some people, it might not be for everyone. I mean the super wide beam covers a lot of area and some people might want a flood light instead or even better a zoomable flashlight that you can control the beam from a flood to a spot light. Now if you lightly press the power button, you can change the power mode to go from High, Medium, Low, Flashing and SOS.

You have two options to power this flashlight, either by using 3x AAA batteries (not included) or 1x 18650 battery (included with a charger). Now I read that the 18650 battery that comes with this flashlight doesn't last that long and that is why there is so many bad reviews. You can buy better quality 18650 batteries online.

It does produce 800 Lumen and a little bit more when I measured it's light output with my meter. It also comes in a nice hard plastic case with foam insert. Overall I am impress with the bright super wide beam of light and I would use this for an emergency or camping only.

I have attached some Image / Video, it might not show up right away. Amazon has since change the way how they process these and when it will show up on the reviews. Please be patience. Thank You.

"Overall this is so great!  I have been missing the Fedex or UPS guy every now and then because I don't hear them knocking on my door because the bedroom is a little further from the front door.  With this, there are no complaints.  The build is good, the ringtones are great, and it is very loud.  I just stuck the doorbell to my door using the double sided table and it looks like it'll stay on pretty sturdy.  Overall great stuff.
I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback and review. Although I've only had it for a few weeks, I wouldn't have given it a different rating even if I hadn't received a discount. I happened to be looking for something like this and evaluated this product openly, as one of the conditions of the discount was that I can certainly give whatever rating and review I wish, even if it were to be negative.",1
"Disclaimer: I received this product at a great discounted rate for my unbiased review. I was offered no incentive for anything other than that and I am giving my own personal opinion based on my purchase of this product and my experience. I take this to heart and include my own opinion and experience with each product. Just like you, the reader, I rely on reviews for all of my personal purchases and because of this I will only rate an item 4 stars or more if I would buy it at full price.

I am not required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product and I won't if I feel I wouldn't pay full price for the product.

I recently purchased an LG G4 and due to me being hard on devices, I decided to purchase some tempered glass to prevent any damage in case the device is dropped. My tempered glass from ShockWize arrived today. It came with 1 tempered glass screen protector, 1 wet wipe, 1 dry cloth, smoother, and some other stuff. The packaging was decent and it also had instructions on the packaging as well and they were easy to understand. Installation of the product was very simple. For the price of this product and the quality it's made of, I would highly recommend this to anyone in need of a screen protector.",1

"I love this case! My Galaxy s6 fits perfectly in it! I purchased this in a hot pink color and while my pictures that I posted here with the review are a bit orangy (i think its the lighting in my apartment) the color is just like how the stock photo shows. I have bought wallet type cases before and one thing that bugs me is the part you snap your phone into is hard plastic and cheaply made. This case however, the part you snap your phone into is a rubber type plastic that bends so you can fit your phone inside without jamming in your phone into a hard plastic case and potentially scratching the phone itself.

There is a magnetic closure which stays closed, its snug around my phone, a good fit. I has a couple credit card slots and a spot for picture id. Its great for when your going out and you don't want to take your whole wallet with you but need the essentials. Overall I love this case, its super cute!

I receive this product free to give my honest unbiased opinion. This toilet brush works great. Its shaped for deeper inside Cleaning purposes. The shape makes it fit and clean very well. The soft bristles still allow for tough scrubbing action without messing up the bristles In any way. The brush cleans off easily as well. I washed/ rinsed it out after each use. The toilet brush holder works great as well. It fits right beside my toilet and holds the brush in place nicely. The cleaning chemicals have not messed up my brush in any way either.,1
"Not a bad storage option for $25. Includes both a small and large size storage basket made from an eco-friendly material, which is a great plus for green-minded people. Both baskets are the same shade of tan that goes well in a muted-color home or apartment. Both baskets fold flat to allow for easy storage. These baskets would be great for use in a home or even a dorm room for a college or university student. My one qualm with them is that they seem a little small for $25 - for the same price you could get a large plastic bin. However, while plastic is not eco-friendly, these baskets are, and more stylish as well.

Overall great buy for storage purposes but be advised that the reason for purchasing should be as an eco-friendly choice or to fit your room colors and style.

"Finding a screen protector that works is a difficult task in some cases. More often than not, you will go through multiple screen protectors before you find one that you can stick with and appreciate. When I am looking for a screen protector, I really just kind of scrounge around until I find one that I like. This screen protector is one of those. I would definitely purchase these screen protectors again in the future if needed because they not only look great but they also fit the screen perfectly. I like that it protects my screen against scratches and shattering as well the fact that it does not diminish the screens quality in any way. The resolution is great, and that is a huge bonus in my opinion. I like the fact that it is so durable as well. After I applied it to my phone, I dropped my phone with a case on it as well, and it didn't break. While I am sure that I will always be on the lookout for a better screen protector, I believe that I will stick with buying from this company for as long as possible so that I know that I am getting a screen protector that will work.

"This is a nice sturdily designed shepherd's hook. The paint was nice and glossy which isn't always the case with outdoor decor. This will definitely stand up to some of my hanging plants.

"Great gloves for light gardening. The nitrite coating caused the fingers to stick together when they are stored and it makes it a little difficult to put on. You have to pull the fingers apart. It is a little hard to pull the  top up completely on your wrists, it takes a little time, not a huge problem. The top of the gloves are not coated with the nitrite so they are breathable on the top.

"I've been wanting to get back into running, but I like to keep my phone with me for safety reasons. This running belt fits my iPhone 6s plus really nicely. It's not jammed in there too tightly, but it's also not going to be bouncing around. There's also room for salt pills, goo, food, keys, credit cards, or any other small items you might need. There is an elastic separator that runs the length of the pouch to keep your items organized, as well as a smaller pocket sewn inside to hold a key or credit card-size item.

On each side of the main pouch, there is a smaller pouch that can hold a goo or small food item. On one side this pocket is open for easy access, and on the other it's fastened with a velcro strap, for better security. The main pouch has a small port for your headphone cord to exit so you can zip it fully and still listen to your music as you run.

The fabric is a really nice, stretchy material and the belt adjusts to give a snug, comfortable fit. One of the issues I've had in the past with running gear is that it bounces too much. This belt, because of it's slim profile and stretchy material, stays in place and doesn't bother me as I run. The black color is really sleek and the trim is reflective to enhance safety on the road.

The only thing I'd really like to see done differently with this item is a more stylish selection of colors to choose from. The black/blue combo is more masculine, and I prefer colors that are more on trend with the running gear from bigger brands like Nike.

"I was pleased with the External Battery RAVPower 16750mAh Portable Charger. It definitely met my expectations. It holds its own charge well. It also has the capacity to do some heavy charging as it can charge two items at one time. I loved the two USB port options. We used our RAVPower to charge a diabetic insulin pump. It seemed to drain energy from the insulin pump on the 2.1 port, but charged it just fine on the 2.4 port. So perhaps different electronic devices need a specific port. I have only had the device about one and a half months. Anyway it worked great and I would highly recommend it.",0

The small has a bit of extra room but he has not escaped from it yet.  I love the color options that are available.  It was hard to choose but we went with the black with blue trim.  The material feels comfortable and durable and should be able to hold up to multiple washings.  I recommend this product for everyones furry friends.

5 stars  I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend everyone to purchase this product!
4 stars  I like it, but there are some flaws. Don't we all have flaws? I would purchase again.
3 stars - It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless there are no other options.
2 stars  There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices.
1 star  I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and recommend others to not purchase.

"I received the Watermelon Slicer, GDEALER Watermelon Corer Cutter Fruit Slicer Corer Cutter Knife Stainless Steel, Smart Kitchen Gadget, Dishwasher Safe Kitchen Tool (1) free or at a discount for my review.

I have seen these advertised all over television - mostly late at night as that is when I am awake. I really wanted one because my daughter eats tons of melon and would love this so I will be giving mine to her next time I see her but now I want one of my own too!
This slicer is made from food grade stainless steel so it is durable and rust proof.
The only fear I have is that the ""prong"" which is between the two blades or main parts may eventually break as it seems to be the only somewhat weak looking part of this design. I DO update my reviews when needed so if you do not see an update that means it is still working and my daughter WILL let me know if it breaks as she knows that I do a lot of reviews and it is important that I keep my opinion honest and updated.
Basically the way it works is genius! It slices your melon (not just watermelon but all types of melon) then scoops it out for you keeping each piece neat and ready to eat!
The black handle part squeezes together and work like tongs so you can simply pick the sliced pieces up out of the rind.
I do like the way the handle feels in my hand - it has a nice grip to it and is comfortable too which is something I look for with kitchen wear as much as clothing. The handle is made of or covered with a rubber like substance.
The blade is sharp but not overly sharp I don't think you could hurt yourself with this unless you tried to although I would keep away from small kiddos.
They say it is dishwasher safe but we hand wash everything so I can't say I tested this but I do believe it to be true as I have bought other things from this seller - GDEALER - before and have never had issues with them, really nice people. So should anything go wrong I know they will honor their money back promise.
I know that this is going to be far safer for my daughter (who can be clumsy) to use over a kitchen knife and no more frustration dealing with cutting a thick rind!
Happy I got one and going to get another!",1
"60 Color Pens from 360Boost
  I feel like a kid again! Having 60 new Gel Pens in every color you can imagine - what a great feeling!  I started out with the neon colors  -my personal favorites.  I have 3 coloring books & I try to make each page a work of art.  These pens are perfect for my artistic side.  It's really relaxing to sit & concentrate on something other than your worries & problems.
  These pens are also wonderful for list-makers.  They really liven up my many lists.  I rarely finish anything on my lists but I figure if I write it down - it's out of my brain!
  Also for doodling, you can get quite creative!  Talking on the phone or watching TV - I come up with lots of ideas.  Flowers, trees, clouds, cats.  Fun!!
  This would be a great set for any age.  Birthdays, Christmas, any time.
  I have tried out every pen in this set.  No skips, No dried up ink, No problems at all.  They come in 5 separate tray-like holders. Perfect for use & storage.

"This belt is thick! Because of its thickness and quality of build this belt will last a long time. I'd recommend this product, but it should be noted that:
The hardware is strong. The buckle is great but not quite as wide as I'd like, and is held in place by tacky screws (which makes changing the buckle easier) and are hidden when you are wearing the belt. There is also a skull and crossbones on the belt that will be hidden when the belt is worn.
My belt appeared more yellow than picture, but with different lighting and variances in the leather it's tolerable.

"I received this product for free from Oral-B to try out.  I have never had, nor used, an electric toothbrush before, so I was both nervous and excited to receive the Pro 3000.  The brush itself is very sturdy and durable, and you can choose what kind of brush head you want depending on your preference.  With my very first use, I learned a bunch of things.  First, I apparently brush a little too hard.  There is a red light that goes on when you are using too much force, and I was able to quickly learn what amount of pressure I needed to apply.  Second, you have to put the brush in your mouth BEFORE you turn it on!  If you don't toothpaste and water will go everywhere!  Lastly, which wasn't a surprise, but this toothbrush worked great!  Every night before I go to bed I feel like I have just been to the dentist and I have the slick, just-professionally-cleaned feeling.  The first few days, while I was still figuring out the pressure, my gums were tender after use; but since then, I haven't noticed any pain or problems.",1
"These are the cutest boots ever!

First I got them in the mail super fast and as soon as I received them I out them on I just couldn't resist and wow they are super comfortable and super stylish! They are perfect! No flaws and no cons! I ordered the slim tan and I couldn't be any happier with the color either! This color really makes these boots pop!

So let's talk about the pocket zipper, the zipper is not meant to go all the way down it goes half way down and you can see the stitch that stops it so the people who say it's getting stuck are not correct that's the way it's supposed to be. It's a style and very cute.

There is a zipper in the side which makes them super easy to put on and it zips up easily also. Another thing I love is the buckles on the back they are very cute and add style to the boot and gives it a flare and military style boot.

These would look great with jeans,leggings, and dresses! These are such great quality and I'm beyond pleased with these boots and would recommend these to anyone even teenagers.

"I was in need for a solar charger to help charge my phone, and this thing has well exceeded my expectations! I love that it comes with a usb cord that has an adapter for an iphone, an old school ipad/iphone, and another one for all of those other devices that aren't made by Apple. The clip that comes with this is kind of useless as it doesn't fit through that hole in the upper corner, but I don't really care about that. it also has a nice little pouch that everything can fit into.

It came in the mail fully charged and when I tried it out on my phone, it charged it quickly which impressed me! I think it charged it quicker than what plugging my phone into an outlet does. When it's charging in the sun, only one green light turns on. To see how much of a charge it's currently holding, you press the power button once and the blue lights will light up (either 1, 2, 3 or 4 lights will turn on, 4 meaning that it's charge to the fullest amount possible). The cord that comes with it is also what it used to charge the solar charger into an outlet/usb port if you are unable to charge it in the sun.

There are two USB ports and it also has a flashlight on the top. One downfall with this is that the old school ipad charger doesn't work with my 2nd gen ipad. For some reason I only seem to be able to charge my ipad with the original cord that came with it... bummer.

I read another review giving it a bad review because they left their charger on the dash in their car and it got ruined, but the instructions state not to leave it in an enclosed space that can heat up a lot, such as a car, otherwise it will cause damage. So don't leave it in your car!

I look forward to being able to use this charger more, and so far it's been fantastic! I did receive this item at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.",1
"I probably send out 10 boxes a week of various sizes, mostly UPS.  This is not 'fidgety' like other kinds (you know, always getting globbed up and sticking to everything that is unintended).  Very strong.  Doesn't rip, easily out performs the brown stuff and duck brand.",0

"This is one of the best cases I have ever used. The quality of the case is great; there is a soft protective layer that surrounds your phone. On top of that is a hard case that covers the soft rubber, so essentially you have double the protection with a not too bulky phone. This case fits my S6 edge perfectly and allows me to use the quick stand while watching youtube, which is very convenient. This is a high quality case and I would recommend this case for people who like to prop up their phone instead of manually holding it.

I truly hope my thorough testing and review of this product has helped you come to a decision.

"I have had concerns about chlorine in the water supply for a long time. I can often smell the chlorine when I am loading the washing machine or running a bath. I didn't want my family to have our open pores sitting in a chlorine bath, so I became interested in getting a shower filter. I bought one at the health food store, but it was very expensive and I couldn't install it easily. I returned it and decided to try this one. This was installed in just a few minutes. It even came with plumber's tape! It also came with an extra filter. I have not noticed as strong a chlorine odor since it was installed. I feel better about my children playing in the bath now.

This item came with a small area of paint scratched. It is unnoticeable if I have that side pointing towards the wall.

I have been making up a Father's Day grill caddy that I handmade for him and this was one of the items I came across to add to it. I am super thrilled that I found this flashlight because I have seen many others that were way more pricey! This flashlight is worth the price and more. I received mine at a discounted rate for leaving an honest review and I am so thankful I did this! I gave my husband his Father's Day caddy early and he loved the flashlight. He's playing with it constantly outside. The kids all fuss over it when we have been playing flashlight tag. I understand why though. The light range is amazing! The only recommendation I can give is make sure you have batteries on hand so you can use it right away!,1
Good,0
"Relevant background on me:
- I would say I am a 8/10 in terms of computer-savviness. Even though I decided not to major in IT or computer science in college, I seem to be the guy that all my friends and family reach out to for solving their computer woes. I have installed MULTIPLE routers at home before. Installing routers has always been quite a comfortable experience for me. This is NOT the first Wireless Access Point I have installed, but I would not say that I was great at installing them either. In fact, I would say that I am a newbie/newb at installing WAPs. NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A ROUTER AND DOES NOT REPLACE YOUR ROUTER.
- I have broadband internet, specifically Comcast. I set a pair of these units up at a small office I volunteer with that is about the size of a larger home and previously had a hard time getting coverage in many locations. We were previously using a pair of NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900s.

About Ubiquiti:
- I was ECSTATIC when I was contacted by Ubiquiti to review this product. From what I heard about Ubiquiti, it is a brand that focuses on corporations/businesses that is trying to break into the high-end consumer market. My friend that owns an IT company that does IT for other companies swears by Ubiquiti and only uses Ubiquiti products for his business. If consumer brands like Netgear, ASUS, D-Link play in the minor leagues providing wireless solutions for regular consumers in homes, brands like Ubiquiti play in the major leaguesthey compete with companies like Cisco to provide wireless solutions for business/companies. Ive seen Ubiquiti Access Points like this get installed in schools, offices, hotels, etc.

Target audience of this product:
- If you have a small studio apartment that you are trying to set up a Wi-Fi network for, this is completely overkill. The real point of getting units like these is to set up multiple access points in several different locations so that you can have a wireless network that covers a large area with people being able to use the wireless network smoothly as they move between different access points. You then manage all the access points together easily on one website/webpage interface. So, this is a good solution for large homes, small buildings that sprawl over several offices, etc. If you are already getting good coverage everywhere in your home/office, this may not be as useful for you. However, if you notice that there is one office at the end of the building or one room at the end of your house getting terrible wireless signal from your router, getting two of these and spacing them apart from each other will definitely help.
- This is NOT A ROUTER. You still need a router if you get this.  If you get this, you would use your old router, and if you have the usual consumer Netgear/ASUS/D-Link router that has has Wi-Fi capabilities, you would simply disable the Wi-Fi capabilities on that router and use the Ubiquiti Access Points to broadcast Wi-Fi.

Installation:
- I admit I was a bit intimidated in setting this up because it was a new experience. It is a bit different from installing a wireless router and requires a bit more configuration, but they provide really great well-written instructions. After you wrap your mind around what a Wireless Access Point is versus a router, it gets pretty intuitive and you can follow the included Quick Start guide like a zombie. I was able to easily set up two wireless access points in under an hour with testing. This is not for a grandma that barely knows how to use an iPad. However, a reasonably tech-savvy home user will have little trouble, if any. I installed one of these access points connected directly via Ethernet to the router, and another one of these access points in wireless bridge mode on another floor of the building where it was impossible to connect directly via Ethernet.

PROS of the product:
- BASIC, SLEEK DESIGN. You can mount it on the wall or ceiling on one side and the part that will be showing simply has a U logo for Ubiquiti surrounded by a circular LED light that lights up in different colors to indicate what the Access Point unit is doing. I find the lights to be nice to look at, but they can be disabled if you find them to be too bright.
- INDOOR/OUTDOOR USAGE. According to the product page on Ubiquitis website, this can be used both indoors and outdoors. For my purposes, I only needed to set it up and use it indoors.
- EXCELLENT RANGE. According to the product page on Ubiquitis website, this has a range of 122 meters/400 feet. Since I set it up indoors, I did not test the full range of this up to 122 meters that would be more easily tested outdoors. I set this up indoors in a very old building that is prone to blocking signal from going to certain offices/locations. While I cannot say the range is truly 122 meters because I did not particularly test that, I can say that compared to the highly-touted consumer NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900, just one unit of the Ubiquiti Wireless Access Point got me excellent signal at great speeds in areas that previously got absolutely no Wi-Fi. I tested this before installing my second unit which further improved my signal.
- BETTER REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE. I had better coverage and better speed compared to the old set-up of NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900s in both speedtest.net tests and real-world usage. Files downloaded faster and webpages were loaded faster in both locations that my old set-up had adequate signal as well as locations that my old set-up had absolutely no Wi-Fi signal so that nothing could be downloaded in the past.
- ABLE TO ROAM BETWEEN ACCESS POINTS WITH SEAMLESS HANDOFF. I was able to travel many times between the two access points seamlessly with no interruptions in loading webpages while browsing, streaming video, and video chatting.
- MANY OPTIONS/CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE TINKERER. This is for the tinkerer! There are lots of options/configurations. If you want to manage every aspect of your Wi-Fi and/or set up extra features, this is for you. That said, after the set-up, I pretty much didn't tinker at all and it already worked great out-of-the-box.
- AFFORDABILITY. Comparable enterprise gear from other brands that provide similar features are MUCH more expensive than this. The quality you get at this price cannot be beat at this time.

CONS:
- NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART! The initial set-up/installation along with the numerous configurations/options can be overwhelming if you are not tech-savvy.

"This case is amaaaaaazing! i received it for free! it was so worth getting it. i love it, its so sleek and think so it doesn't bulk up the phone yet it still protects the phone so well. it looks great on my gold iphone, matches the entire phone very well. i love the design, recommend to anyone",1
"I love this box! Exceeded my expectations. It's a classic and sturdy storage box. It is big enough to hold quite a lot of stuff. For me, it's the perfect place to put my crafting stuff. I don't like leaving stuff out, but if I put everything away it takes twice as long to get it all back out when I have time to craft again.  This box looks nice on a shelf or in the corner of the room, and I have everything I need in one place. I like that the lid is attached to the box at the back and isn't a separate lid. I would love to get a couple more of these for storage.

"I personally did not like these bracelets.  I thought they felt very oily anth that they were cheaply made.  The little plastic piece that pushes through one of the holes to fasten it to your wrist is so small that the slightest bump makes it drop from your wrist.

It didn't stay on long enough to find out if they actually repelled bugs.

I was  provided a sample for review.  I hope my my experience helps you decide.",1

"Very nice and easy for running, or even walking the dog.  It was a nice change from the normal leash, not having to hold it in my hand.  Was very easy to adjust and get the right fit.  The only thing i would change on it, is the leash to the the dog slides around on the belt.  I wish there was a snap button, or something that it could stay put on the side.

Other than that it's a great addition to any runners accessories, who has a dog.

"These bluetooth head phones are perfect for what I need them for. They are slim around the ears and the piece that actually goes in the ear stay in without hurting or budging.

"This watermelon slicer is a convenient tool that makes my kitchen less messy. I watched the video before trying and it didn't come out as pretty as the video. For my second try, I gave it more pressure and it came out much better than the first time. It saves me a lot of time and I like the size of each watermelon slice with this slicer. This is the kind of tool that you need to have little practice with but it is worth it.

"It is hard, at first, to get used to wearing these for pullups etc, but I just kept at it, broke them in and now I don't leave to the gym without them. I liked these much more after they were broken in. Here's a little tip on how I did it which comes from how I use to break in baseball gloves. Tip for breaking in leather gymnastic grips. 1. Fill a tall microwave safe kitchen glass 3/4 full of water and microwave for 2.5 minutes ish. You want the water very hot. (use a hot pad to pull the glass out carefully when done). 2. Roll the grips up like a piece of carpet and push them down into the water (use a wooden spoon). 3. Let the grips soak for 15-30 minutes ish.. 4. Take them out and let them air dry hanging on the side of the sink (should take a day or so). 5. The grips will feel a little stiff initially, rough them up a bit with your hands and they will turn super flexible and completely broken in. This should work for ""reviving"" old grips as well. All in all, I think this is a very well-made product for protecting your hands from getting too calloused and tearing.. If you are in the market for a product such as this, then do not hesitate to buy from this seller. I have given you my honest experience with this product for which I received a discount from the seller. If there was something wrong with this product I would tell you. I hope you have found my review helpful, if so press yes. Good health and happy shopping to you.",1
"Awesome quality surpasses expectations.  This running belt/pack is made of materials that are durable while being light and flexible.  Very comfortable to wear and light enough that you really don't notice that you have it on.  There is a very strong clasp on an approx. 1.5 wide adjustable web belt.  Im impressed that It has a good sized clip making it easy to buckle or remove even if your are wet from rain or sweat.  The clip is surely  strong enough that you can be confident that the pocket remains securely in place even on a very aggressive run.  The ample sized pocket is capable of holding your phone, I.D. and other additional items.  I found that I can run the earphone cord through a small hole in the front of the pocket so that there is less chance of it becoming tangled.  There are also 4 elastic (2 on each side of the pocket) places to put things like pepper spray, etc. to have handy if ever needed.
The pocket has a divider that runs the length of the pouch which then gives 2 separate areas and there is a 3rd small pocket that I haven't yet found a use for but you can bet I will.  When traveling through airports Ill be using this for my passport and currency and it is thin enough that it can be kept out of site under your clothing.  A real deterrent to pick-pockets and other thugs trying to claim what is rightfully yours as theirs.
I am very comfortable in recommending this well constructed waist belt for runners, joggers, walkers and travelers.  Much more substantial than the typical fanny pack I am really satisfied with this item.  I was fortunate enough to have received this item at no charge in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.  All opinions are my own and there was no attempt to influence me to write a positive review.",1

Burei Mens Day and Date Calendar Quartz would be perfect for you then.  This watch has the look and feel of a high dollar luxury watch without breaking your bank account. It has a very professional look , is corrosion and both scratch resistant and water resistant as well as shock resistant.

I gave this to my son who just graduated college and was excited to add this to his attire while interviewing. He loves to dress up the GQ look, but definitely does not have the budget to afford all the luxuries needed to attain that look.

 The watch was easy to set the time, day and date and also easy to take links out for a better fit. The watch battery life is 3 years according to Burei paperwork and it comes with a 2 year warranty for maintenance for quality issues as well as a 12 month replacement or full refund for quality issues.

I did receive this watch in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I did give it a 5 star review because the watch met the expectations I had, is sophisticated in look and easy to set time as well as adjust the links.  For me one of the biggest factors of this watch once again is the price  it truly appears to be a high end accessory, but at the time of the purchase is under $50.00

My boys made a joke as we were creating the review that I do have to share  why spend the big bucks on a gift for the man you are dating until you know he is for sure the one? It is true you can give a great looking, sophisticated, functional watch and he will think you spent a fortune on him.

As I was doing this review a picture showed up on Instagram - I do realize it is black and white but as you can see my great looking boys are out together and if you look you will see my son in the background is indeed wearing the watch I gave him.  I think you can also tell my boys like to look good ha ha, so for him to wear the watch while going out just proves to me he loves the watch - it looks great - it appeals to young professionals definitely!",1
"I love love loooooooooooove this camera. I was looking for a camera so I can check on the house when we aren't home. We have a dog and I wanted to see her. Also when we leave the kids with babysitters I want to check on them. I read the reviews and some people say they had a problem with the wireless connection. I did too when trying to hook it up. But you actually have to do EXACTLY what the directions say. It says hook the ethernet wire up, set up your wireless THEN you can detach the ethernet wire. Of course, I thought I didn't want it plugged into my router, so I didn't do that. Ha...it would've saved me time. After I plugged it in, set up my wireless info, I unplugged it, and it was all ready to go. So when I read those reviews, I think they expect to hook it up wirelessly. (You have to at first but then unplug it and you're great).  I don't know why I didn't have one of these years ago. Maybe the technology has advanced, but I love it. And my kids love it. It has a 2 way speaker, also (way super cool) so I can tell my kids to get off the computer, or tell the dog to get off the couch. It has night vision also. My only ""con"" is that I would love a volume switch on the camera itself. When you turn it on, it is super super loud in its beeps. So if it's in a sleeping baby's, it would be really loud on start up. But only on start up. The moving camera isn't noisy. I wish I could turn the volume down for the start up and turn it up so she I'm 2-way talking, it could be louder. But I wouldn't even complain about the volume because I love this so much. I've check on the dog while picking up the kids. And I've checked on the kids when I went to the neighbors. LOVE LOVE LOVE. The instructions weren't hard to follow. Very precise. The app is easy to run. Some other comments talk about an app and that isn't the name of the app in my instructions, so maybe they made a new app that is easier and friendly for less techy people (me). I can move the camera angle from my app. So I can scan the room, up, down and around. I've read in some comments that the paper instructions were very ""chinese"". Maybe they re-did them, but mine were easy to understand. I attached a copy of the instructions, you can see what you think for yourself. I also took a picture from the app and emailed it to myself. That is ""my living room"" picture taken from the app with a date and time stamp and my dog on the floor (after I talked through the camera and told her to get off the couch). The last picture is the hardware that came with it. The blue wire is the ethernet wire that you MUST hook to your router just while you are installing it. I received a discount on this when I purchased it to ask for my honest review. I honestly love it and would buy another even without a discount. I hope this helps you when looking to get something like this, vote for ""helpful"" if it helped you. Thank you . It's a great price and it has been working great for me. We love it.",1

"These arrived greatly packaged. It is made out of high quality metal that does not rust. It is also very resistant to the heat. You can use them to cook quickly or move them to slow cook meats.

The ventilation on the baskets allow maximum heat to travel through the grill. It fit perfectly into my grill. These helped to not burn up my burgers. It also made my vegetables perfectly!

They are great for cooking with indirect heat. It also replaced the foil bakeware I was using in the middle of the coals to separate them. I was very pleased with the ease of use and the convenience it provided.

They were really easy to clean as well. You can literally shake them to clean them out and it all falls out!! I just wish they would of had instructions but thankfully i had someone who knew what to do with them!

"First, the product feels well made, nothing is loose. I tried charging my LG G5, and as expected, charges in <1.5h.
Second, the blue LED stays on when nothing is plugged in, and slowly blinks blue if something is charging.
Third, The USB-C is a nice touch for when USB-C to USB-C cables are more prevalent, though they're relatively rare right now. Because of this, I haven't been able to try charging two items simultaneously.

Personally though, I will be using this in the living room as a guest charger. I say that because the blue LED light drowns my small bedroom in blue pulses and I can't sleep like that. On the other hand, if you need to stay awake, maybe this is the product for you! In the meantime, it'll make a pretty addition to any common areas where people aren't sleeping. It's compact size and dual ports means it's easy to share with multiple people.

I received this product for free from iOrange-E in return for an honest, unbiased review. In the future, I would suggest an off switch for LED lights or to make the lights dimmer/smaller. Personally, I just need to know it's working, not where it is.",1
"I absolute love this clock. My kids are recently on summer vacation and my little girl wanted to do some arts and crafts to decorate her room so this was absolutely perfect. I found this and it looked pretty simple so I figured why not get it. My little girl and I could do some bonding and build it! It was so easy to set up and build. It came with 12 sticks and a second hand and a disc. As for the quality of the material, it seem to be a durable plastic. I allowed my daughter to customize it by organizing the order of the colors that she wanted. I then place the battery in and it was ready to put in action. I hung it up on her wall. She can't stop showing it to her friends when the come over. It was very easy and is interchangeable. My daughter wanted to switch up the colors after a week so I took it down, and she rearranged it. It was a good addition to her room to say the least. One complaint that I would have to this product is that the clock noise is a little loud so it does take my daughter a longer time to fall asleep. But overall it is very good DIY project to do with your kids. In fact you don't even need kids, you can do this for your own room if you are looking to change things up a bit. I would recommend this product to everyone who is looking for a fun and easy to step up clock.

"This is an excellent packable jacket with a super thin exterior and very warm down layer inside for heat retention and breathability. The design is wonderful with hood and pockets. The sewing job is very good and meticulous throughout. The sizing is on the small side, so I suggest getting a size up, unless you prefer the tight fit look. Comes with an equally light pouch that is handy for travel. With a recognized brand attached, this would go for much more due to the overall high quality.

"This iPad 2 case from Oner Group Corp. props your iPad up in several different ways. Vertically and horizontally, but also each way has three different angles. It's multifunctional so it can fit a lot of people's needs. Like I'm using the lower horizontal way to type this review. Later I can use a higher angle to watch videos or a movie. This case seems durable without being too bulky. It also has a loop for a stylus so you don't loose it. I chose the color blue and I think it looks really professional. I would recommend this iPad 2 case to anyone who uses their iPad frequently and for multiple uses.

Love love love this shirt! It's longer in the back which is perfect for so many looks. The blue color is just as pictured online. It's a vibrant color!!! The neckline is tailored well and fits comfortably. The sleeves can be adjusted up or down with the D rings. I prefer them up because when they are down they have half the D ring exposed and dangling from the outside. The material is not too sheer and is comfortable to wear. It's such a flattering shirt on so many body types. I received this shirt at a discount in exchange for an honest review and love it.,1
"I love portioned containers like this because I always have a little bit of lots of things leftover and I don't like to bring 5 different small containers with me when I bring my lunch.  This set was bigger than I expected.  The containers are divided into 3 portions that hold enough food for one person.  Although this set advertises healthy eating with portion controlled sizing, that was not my intended purpose for this set.  The lid snaps securely on the base with a fold over lock in place lid so that you know it's shut.  Each portion in the container is not completely leak proof so if you have a lot of liquid there is the possibility that it can leak into another portion.  (if you have juicy green beans in one section, there is a chance it could leak over to the mashed potatoes in another section- keeping the container up right helps minimize the chances of this happening).  The neoprene zippered storage case has ample room to hold one container, a napkin, and a plastic fork.  I used it to keep my food cold since I have a long commute to work and want to keep my food consistently cool until I am ready to reheat it.  It would also be useful to those people that may not have access to a fridge or microwave though out the day.  The lid colors and the bag all coordinate so it's easy to keep it together as a set.  The containers are dishwasher safe which is a mandatory prerequisite for me.  I also like that they are BPA free so I feel better about reheating my food in the container themselves.  These are also freezer safe should you choose to freeze food portions ahead of time.  The bottom portions all fit into each other for more compact storage.  For those that need to bring a lunch everyday, this is a great product.

"Well quite impressed with this product, just what I needed to replace the one I accidentally broke. It does not come with a lid because is a Universal espresso carafe, not all espresso machines are alike. I conserved my original lid which fits perfectly. The only problem I encountered is that the cups measurements are a little off in contrast to the original one I had (which is the reason I don't give it a 5 star).

But overall its an excellent product, the glass is thicker than the one I had which makes it more durable... I recommend it!",0

It has a fill line, so make sure not to go over that with water and add your favorite essential oils and start diffusing your air! When you press the mist button, it turns on. Press and hold to turn it off. Same with the light. Push it once to turn it on and it switches between 7 colors, or press and hold to leave it off!

I really love this in my bathroom upstairs and I would definitely recommend it!

I bought this to make squash spaghetti at a later date but no squash at the store so I tried it with carrots. It's it hard to use at first. I use medium size carrots from the garden. I followed the instructions it comes with. I used the guard on the carrot. I am not cutting myself as these are shape so be careful and study this product before your use it. As to where to put your hands. It was easy to use. I used both sides to see the difference in the shavings. it came with a extra blade that was for bigger spirals. While I used it to cut carrots and toward half way the carrot wouldn't go any farther cause the safety guard holding the carrot wouldn't turn anymore it just cuts through the carrots. One of the metal prongs broke off. So that was disappointing but I can still use it. I like the spirals I can use it in soups and easier to cut up. Disclamer: I did get this item free or a discount. I am to give my unbiased and honest opinion. I review after I have tried the item only. This is my honest and true review after use (pictures below),0
"I have purchased a few of these type products from places like Walgreens, Lowes etc. They just don't last. I got one of these garden hoses last fall and loved it. It's still working great. So I got another one that just arrived to use in my back garden area. It's great. It seems so much more durable than the ""as seen on tv"" ones that I have purchased locally. What I like is that the seller has improved an already great product. Packing was awesome. The sprayer was bubble wrapped inside the package to protect it. They also upgraded the ball valve to metal. The cheap ones locally are all plastic and that's one thing I have had failures on in the past. Especially if I forget to bring it inside in the winter. I think the brass will last for years to come. I also appreciate that the inner tube is now made in the USA and advertised as the worlds strongest. You can tell it's stronger just because when you turn the water off, the garden hose still has lots of water pressure as it keeps spraying as the hose goes back to the small size, I guess that's part of the expandable garden hose design, it
needs a lot of rubber strength to expand and then go back to the small size for storage. But the 50 feet length is perfect for my small backyard garden that I have in my covered back patio. My HOA won't allow a regular garden so I have to plant everything in pots and containers. And having a garden hose that shrinks back to such a small size is perfect. From the bad reviews I've seen of the less expensive hoses. I think it's their inferior latex that causes the failures. The one I got locally only lasted about 2 weeks then developed several leaks. I think the made in USA inner tube will be much more durable than the cheaper latex. I also worry about watering my ""food""
with any type of product that might be toxic. Many latex garden hoses are made with questionable plastics and are considered by many to be toxic. Overall with the improvements this seller has made from the better bass fittings, leak proof system and new design 9 spray setting sprayer I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a quality expandable garden hose. I've attached photos of the valves. They are very heavy duty.
 I received this product at a discount for an honest review.

Update:

After a couple of weeks the hose started leaking in 2 spots. It wasn`t around anything to put holes in it. I used it on my back porch to water my flowers. Then I lay it back on the table out of the weather.  Disappointed.",1
"I am very happy with this product, it does keep its shape very well. I have a Bichon and a Rat Terrier and this fits on both of them perfectly. I have noticed that they sleep more comfortably with this collar than with the plastic ones, which I also own and use on my dogs when needed.",0
"This is a good case. Very protective. The only down fall is that a little water gets on it, it turns the phone a little black. It just has to be wiped off though.

"These gloves run a tad small and are a little tight on me. I went according to the size chart - it suggested I order XS but I went ahead and ordered the S instead. The fit was still a bit tight for my hands. The gloves in general were made well and the middle strap ensures a good fit.

"Beautiful! Perfect! Convenient! Well made! Love it! Oh I can't say enough positive things about this SafeCard RFID Blocking Card Holder Case.

It is a perfect size. Unlike others I have seen, this one has ample space inside so I can easily insert & remove my cards and ID. When I open it, the inside envelope style holders fan out. I can see all of my cards at a glace but because the holders are RFID Blocking, as I pull out one card the rest stay safe.

It is a beautiful case. I got the purple because I wanted to be able to see it in the bottom of my purse. And see it, I can! It's not only purple, it is a shiny, lovely shade of purple. I have no problems noticing it and yet somehow it doesn't seem too flashy...at least not to me.

It is convenient. This case has 7 secure slots to hold cards and all of them are at my fingertip any time I open it. No more having to tug and pull to remove a card, no more having to push and push to put one back in.

It is easy to use. The latch, seems to glide open. I've had the kinds with the metal thing that I had to push in with my fingernail in order to open but not this one. I place my thumb or finger on the, I what I assume to be, silicone and simply slide it and it opens. Wow! And speaking of that silicone, there is a layer of silicone that goes around the opening which makes this card holder case close quietly.

I love it! And, I really do want to mention one of my favorite things... the corners are rounded not squared. This case feels elegant and looks classy. I will definitely be using this for years.

I spent $16 to get this tape converter and it was well worth the price even though the unit construction is somewhat on the cheap side. The door won't stay closed when there is a tape in it.  I bought this unit to convert our 33 year old audio wedding tape to an MP3 file and am very happy that I did so. The software that comes with the unit is very impressive for what I paid and have seen some audio software much more expensive do less. This unit came packaged very well and works just as advertized.  I'd buy it all over again.,0

"Perfect fit on device and a very unique style of protection and look. Quality protection in materials, yet affordable. Definitely like no other case or phone manufacturing. Package was a cool professional presentation. Great case in the areas that matter to the cosumers....stylish, affordable, protection, and great professional company. I love this case as it protects, but still shows off the phone. Spigen is no joke. ""I received this product for free (or at a promotional discount) in exchange for my honest review""",1

"I bought this for my husband to use, especially for hands-free talk in the car, since we do not have BT sound in our car.  We had one BT device for him to use, and it was ok, but it didn't stay on the ear well and comfortably, so he didn't bother using it most of the time. We don't HAVE to be hands-free in our state, but it's still better that we do.  He had a 30 mile compute to work, so really needed to have something he could use daily.

When I gave this to him, he looks at it kinda funny, and tried to put it in upside down.  I showed him how it's supposed to fit and he found it was pretty nice.

He's been using it quite a bit since in his car and at work.  He says that it does hurt the ear some when he wears it all day.  It could use some rubberized material, I think, to cushion it inside the ear.

The sound is decent - he's using it mainly for phone, so high quality is not necessary here

The weird part is when he first started using it, the verbal info that it played through the earpiece (connected, pairing, call ended, stuff like that) was in an Asian language.  Suddenly after a couple days it was in English with a very think non-native accent. The lang. didn't but him much, just was funny, I think he's entertained now by the accent.

Overall, he really does like this earpiece and it's become quite helpful for him.

This is a very nice mid season sweater.  I bought it as a gift for a friend who currently spends a lot of time waiting for appointments and needs a little something to buffer the effects of AC. I also ordered this one because the coral color is perfect for her wardrobe.  This sweater is soft to the touch and just enough to take the chill off without being too heavy.  It is also nicely shaped for a plus size sweater and it is very stylish.  I am very pleased with my purchase and think it is a great value. *a discount was received in exchange for an honest and unbiased review if this product.

"The case was beautiful and everything fit wonderfully on day one.
Day two: the button that holds the two card covers closed broke and stayed stuck, so now this whole thing is useless.
The phone is held by a magnet, and the magnet does not give me enough confidence to trust my phone to it. It would be fine if it had a clasp on the bottom in order to prevent the phone slipping out, considering that this has a wrist strap to hold it by, but the lack of this feature makes this very risky for carrying your phone around, at least on the wrist
Very poorly built, did not last at all, would not recommend. But hey, I guess I got what I paid for.",0
"These shoes are just the cutest things I have ever seen and they look so very adorable on my son. He was so excited when they showed up and he tried them on. They fit perfectly which was a wonderful surprise to me! I was afraid they would be too small but they were just right. They are wonderful at not getting stains on them. My son is five and he was running around outside in the grass and when he came in the bottoms were still just as white as ever. I would definitely recommend these to a friend. They are awesome shoes!!!

"I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion. I tend to read and base my purchases on customer reviews, therefore, I am very open and honest with my opinions. My rating of this product was in no way, shape, or form influenced by the seller.

These goggles are awesome! I love the carrying case that they came in, it also came with a little plastic bag that holds the nose clips, interchangeable nose bridge for the goggles, and ear plugswhat a plus! The adjustable silicone nose bridge is awesome because I use the smaller and my husband uses the larger. It is great to be able to change the size when needed. The strap is silicone which means NO breaking, snapping, or stretchingyou can adjust it to the size you need and it stays. The strap is very soft and comfortable to wear around my head. The clasp is very easy to use (open/close) and it looks very sturdy. These goggles are made from quality materials (you can tell right away) to ensure that they are waterproof and shatterproof; ensuring that the lenses stay strong with no leaking regardless of swimming conditions. They have polycarbonate panoramic lenses with mirror coating which provides clarity and protects your eyes from harmful UV rays. Normally I wear my sunglasses in the pool but not anymoreinstead, I always use these goggles. The lenses are also anti-fog which is great. When I placed them on, the seal suctions to my face and when worn correctly you will have NO leaks what so everthey are great! The carrying case fits the goggles and all accessories perfectly, it snaps and stays closed to ensure nothing will be lost while carrying. I am very happy an impressed with the overall quality of these goggles and how well they work, I highly recommend them to anyone whom needs a reliable pair.

I also ordered a second pair for my husband so we don't have to share anymore ;)

"I don't have kids, but I do consider myself a bit of a Peter Pan at heart. What can I say, I like cool things! And this Night Lighting Lamp is really neat. I have been using it at night and it really helps to calm me before going to bed. I also lay in my bed staring up at the stars moving across the ceiling. It of course does not look exactly like being outside, since the stars are more exaggerated and you can have them in different colors and floating across your room. But it does do a good job of capturing the wonder that you felt as a child.

The device gets power from a Micro USB Cable, which is becoming more and more common these days. You can power it from your computer or use your cell phone charger brick. Very simple and convenient!

I specifically like the fact that this unit will stay on all night -- which makes it pretty nifty if I need to wake up in the middle of the night to visit the bathroom. Most other night lights similar in design will turn off automatically after one hour and there is no way to change that setting. Lame!

A special unexpected bonus with this light -- my cat LOVES it. He sleeps next to me and I watch him sit there and stare at the stars as they dance around the room. He is an indoor cat and it makes me happy to see him have a new experience and clearly like it.

So if you have children -- they'll love it. If you are a child at heart, I suspect you'll like this just as much as I do.

"If you like cases that look nice and do not feel bulkier on your hands, this is the right product for you!
I have an Iphone 6, and before I bought this case, I was using those really bulky and heavy cases made out of hard plastic and rubber. The case was so big that my phone looked like a piece of brick - I am not even kidding! When MaxTeck gave me the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price, I decided to upgrade my case. Couldnt be happier! The other one was supposed to protect my phone from falls, but it did not. My phone's screen is kind of broken because of a fall (and I had that case on!) of about 3 feet from the ground. Now, with this case, I feel like it really will protect my phone. It fits the phone well, it protects all the corners, and the phone looks great. It does not prevent you from taking pictures, because the case does not cover not even a little bit of the camera. All the buttons work just right, and everything looks perfect.
The package also arrived in time and intact!

"There isn't so much you can say about a cellphone or a tablet mount especially if they're nothing special. After seeing this mount online for almost 4yrs now I finally decided to try it out even though I did see some reviews that seams to be false (claiming the magnet interfering with reception) which I did not have any reception issues with this mount.
The application of this mount can't be more simple then what it is which turns this mount into not a tiny mount it's the one that holds my phones & even tablets better then any other mount I've owned in the past. Adjusting the desired angle is truly the best out of any other mount due to its ball shape that allows you full control to reach the perfect angle you are looking for.
This beautiful set came with 2 phone plates and 1 tablet plate, 2 replacement base stickers, tablet plate replacement sticker, wet wipe to clean the surface before applying the mount.
Overall I'm very pleased with this amazing little mount that does a wonderful job holding my phone and tablet without having to worry about the phone/tablet falling off the mount.
I'm thankful I was able to receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased opinion and honest review.

"I received this item at a discounted price in accordance to my agreement to provide a honest, unbiased review in return. My first impression on these bootlaces is mainly that they are just very long, i wear black timberland boots for riding my motorcycles, and the laces frequently break. I bought these laces to help stop that issue. As of using these laces, ive had no tears, and ive had not any annoying extra lace aswell. The laces fit my boots perfectly even with being laced up all the way to the top. The quality of these laces for the price is unargueably the best ive seen on the market, and speaking from experience, these ones are perfect for a rugged user of boots.
Im extremely happy with how these laces have worked for me, and i hope this it can be helpful to you guys reading this review too.

This year we decided to enhance the look of our garden by putting up some garden string lights. We had some before, but the wires got accidentally cut and we've been looking for a replacement for some time. I particularly wanted a set that twinkled rather than just all blinked on or off. This seems to be a rare feature these days, as I was having a hard time finding a set.

I noticed that this set of solar string lights have 8 modes, and one of them seemed to be a twinkling mode. I was so excited! I also liked the fact that the lights are warm white, and not the cool white, which could give off a harsh bluish glow.

After receiving the lights, I set them outside in the sun for a whole day to charge up. I made sure that all 200 lights lit up before placing them on my trellis. At night, I could see that there were no defective ones, and they all lit up brightly.

We strung them up the next day, and I took this video to show the twinkle effect. Because of the darkness and the limitations of the iphone, the garden looks much darker than it is in reality, but I hope you can see how nicely they glow and sparkle in the night. I recommend you use full screen so that you can see the effect better. I panned the camera so that you can see how far these string lights extend!

I highly recommend this set to anyone who wants to add a touch of magic to their garden.

"Upon unpacking the case, I realized this was a REALLY GREAT case at the price point, and was very surprised, compared to some other recent cases I have reviewed. I usually compare many of my phone cases to a Speck brand case I had in the past, as I really enjoyed the feel, quality and protection it gave. This case is almost identical to one I had prior in many aspects, as far as feel and design.  I was surprised how nice the feel of the case was and sleek looking the color appeared. All the cutouts for access to camera and connection ports are just right, and I really like the button reveals on the sides that help for pushing those buttons. It does have a great feel in your hand, and has a sleek and also a nice grip from the rubberized sides on the case.
I also like the double case protection it somewhat has with the case that surrounds the plastic housing also, almost like a 2 in 1 case.  One seems like a sleeve, and the other is the case that surrounds the sleeve, creating a cool look and creating a shock absorption design at the same time.  It does have a great feel in your hand, and has a sleek and also a nice grip on the sides on the case.

This case does have a sleek look, but I cannot comment on the drop protection, as I can compare it to most other typical cases, that are not built for strength or drop protection, instead of looks.  I would not say it offers less protection than other cases, perhaps the same, but not what you would expect from an ""Otterbox"" case.  This looks a ton better in my opinion, but having said that, I will definitely be using this case and swapping around as I normally do.

PROS:

Sleek looking
Great feel in hands
Screen protector (film), cloth and applicator included

CONS:

"My company bought this chair for me, after I started having back and hamstring issues.  I am able to adjust it perfectly for me although the seat pan just barely extends far enough.  (I am just shy of 6' 2"", with a thin, athletic build.)  The lumbar support is adjustable, but not continuously.  Instead, adjusts at discrete intervals of what might be .5 inches.  (I can't see two adjacent holes, with my setting, and I ain't touching it.)  I can only use the neck brace by consciously leaning back into it.

The chair seems very well built.  I had no trouble putting it together, and I doubt it will fall apart.",0

No more pre-pumping tubing equipment before we head for the lake or the river. No more waiting around while somebody with strong lungs blows up a huge beach ball or inflatable chair. Just choose the right size nozzle, plug this little wonder in, and let it blow! It comes with a cigarette lighter adaptor for your car, along with an AC/DC wall plug to use. If there is anything I would like to change, it might be that these come with a little longer lengths to the plugs, but they are acceptable as-is. And, one more thing: here's the biggie--this same pump can be used to deflate those things you blew up with it, which makes packing up and putting away a whole lot easier and, thus, way more fun for you.

"I'm in love. This is the softest duvet I've ever purchased. I bought the grey full/queen. It fits perfectly. It was easy to put on by myself. And again, SO SOFT. Brushed microfiber is my new favorite bedding material. I have 3 cats and 3 Labradors so I absolutely need to have a duvet on my bed or I end up washing my comforter constantly.

"DESIGN

Light and compact.  It does not squeeze your head when wearing, but the top headband does hit your head.  The cable is flat and the plug is at 90 degree, but still has enough clearance that I would expect most cases will still be fine.  This is supposedly for travel, but it would be difficult to tell RIGHT and LEFT in the dark as it just embossed in small in the inside.

SOUND

Sound performance to some extent is personal.  So the review is subjective.  But I have listened to this using CI Audio VHP-2 headphone amplifier with CD as source.  (I am not really an audiophile.)  But for the price, this is a great value.  Bass is little low, but otherwise the output is clean.  In fact, because of the pads and/or the tuning, I think this sounds less dull than the more expensive RP-HF300M.

Purchased this for my son and he loves using it.  Can say its a good purchase.,0
"To start off with I want to say that I think this is seriously the best grill cover I have ever owned! I recently needed two grill covers, one for my Oklahoma Joe offset smoker and one for my Brinkmann gas grill. To compare this cover to one sold at Home D... Back when I only had an offset smoker I went to Home D. and found a cover to fit the tall smoke stack and large smoker. The cover was thick and durable but the problem was that it cost me around sixty bucks!

I recently obtained a Brinkmann gas grill and needed a cover. The total width of my Brinkmann is 62"" wide (including the end handles). The advertised maximum width of this KMA grill cover is 58"". I read all of the reviews and asked the seller if my 62"" grill would fit this cover but did not get any answers. I decided to take a chance thinking the cover might have an extra few inches that I needed to cover the handles.

I was extremely impressed of the quality of this grill cover when it came it. I was shocked to see that it felt like better quality and was definitely thicker that the one from Home D.
I placed the KMA grill cover over my Brinkmann and I was totally surprised!! It was a perfect fit!! I even had about 1 1/2"" of extra material at the end... The added zippered grill accessory pocket is an excellent addition to the cover. The zipper is good quality and is extremely well sewn into the cover. The pocket itself measured out at 16"" wide and 13"" deep.
The KMA cover has four straps to hold it down from the wind, two on each end. The straps have a compression buckle to retain the tension. I would have liked to see a quick disconnect feature instead.
I was not expecting to receive the gloves and grill brush as they did not advertise them and as also mentioned in some reviews.

I would have easily given sixty dollars or more for this grill cover if I would have found it at a local store. I am so impressed with this grill cover I gave the seller a five star review for quality.
I did not get this grill cover for free, I was not obligated or encouraged to give it a five star review. I was no obligated to post a detailed review, nor was I obligated to post pictures.
I received this grill cover at a discounted price for my honest review. If this review helped your decision please vote as helpful.",1
"Salt and Pepper Grinder Set - This is a set of brushed stainless steel refillable salt and pepper mills.  These grinders are lightweight, with stainless steel top and glass body which allows you to see the level.  They both adjust the coarseness of salt and pepper.  One nice thing that makes these different from other grinders is that the grinder is on the top.  That means no more salt and pepper left on your tablecloth.  Both grinders are adjustable from fine to coarse.  I have included pictures which show how fine or how coarse I was able to grind both salt and pepper.  As a bonus, they are easy to fill...just screw off the top and you have a very wide opening so no salt or pepper is spilled when refilling.

Overall, I am thoroughly pleased with the product and think they are a great value.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, however, the discounted price did not influence my product review. My reviews are based on my own personal opinion of the product and the experience I had in using the product.  This review is my own opinion and I am in no way influenced by the seller or the fact that I received the product at a discount.  I have had ample time to evaluate and test the product.  Based on my evaluation of the product and the price, I would and have recommend this product to family and friends.  As always, if anything changes my opinion of the product, I will update my review to reflect those updates. Please let me know if you have any questions.  Hopefully my review has helped you, as I know I always read reviews before purchasing anything anymore.  In my opinion, customer reviews are the most honest and helpful.",1

I needed a new one, but wanted something better than the cheap plastic ones at the local dollar stores. Since this one is metal I decided to try it. It came with two quick connect adapters to fit the hoses, so the nozzle will just ""snap"" on and off the hose without having to unscrew it. This would be useful if you intend to use it on more than one hose around your house. There was also some extra rubber washers and o-rings to fit the adapters in case it ever starts to leak. Just replace whatever seal is leaking. That's a nice bonus! The nozzle itself is very well made, one of the best I've ever had. It's nice and sturdy with some weight to it. It's all metal with a rubber coating around the handle for grip and comfort. The spray end is an adjustable brass piece that allows you to adjust all the way from the finest mist/fan pattern to a narrow jet stream. We don't have the best water pressure here, but this nozzle still gives a nice strong jet when adjusted for it. There is also the usual locking piece that can be used to lock the handle on to spray continuously and the little threaded ""knob"" on the back for adjusting the free play in the handle, or setting the flow rate when locked on. Overall the nozzle works very well, seems extremely durable, doesn't leak anywhere, and came with some nice bonus extras. I recommend it for anyone looking for a GOOD nozzle and not just another cheap throw away one.

I did get this at a discount for evaluation and review, but that does not change my opinion of the product or my rating and review. If it's junk I will happily warn other potential buyers, I would appreciate the same from other reviews when shopping online and strive to give the same in return. I honestly feel this deserves the rating I'm giving it. I hope this helps!",0

"Very good firesteels. These work just as one would expect. At 5"" long, there is plenty of space to produce a lot of sparks. The striker has one flat edge and one slightly serrated edge, as well as a 1 cm ruler. Neither the serrations or ruler serve any purpose, but they also don't take anything away from the effectiveness. The paracord is a nice touch, and it is also easily removed if you want to save the weight. When I use a firesteel, I need it to light both my stove and a natural tinder bundle. This steel lit my gas stove, alcohol stove, and a grass bundle on the first strike. This will definitely make it into my pack.

The Easy Spirit Traveltime clogs are the most comfortable shoes I own!  I have five pairs of various colors and decor. I love them! They are the only shoes I can order by mail and know they will fit perfectly.,0
"These are great screen protectors. I run a farm and teach horseback riding lessons, my phone is in pretty much constant danger. These screen protectors are tough, but I've managed to crack a few at the barn or in the riding ring. Not once has my phone's screen gotten so much as a scratch!

I think they have improved the cut/fit on these too. They always fit well, but this set was just a little closer to precise edge to edge coverage. Makes it a little fussier to get the protector on, but you get better protection so that's not a complaint.

This set also came in a neat wooden box. Handy for storing the second protector and the little cleaning tools that come with it. Less likely to lose the second one in the back of a drawer or whatever, and a nice touch.

"Received this item free of charge in return I am writing this review.
I have never heard of Afunta before this product and I should also mention I never had any intention of ever putting any kind of screen protector on this camera as its my wifes and up to her to take care of it.

I am installing this screen protector on a Sony a5000 mirrorless dslr

Unboxing: Literally this is a small box that opens up to reveal the contents, very easy, 5/5
Items: 2 of everything neatly arranged, easy to find, nothing difficult to remove, 5/5
Instructions: no words, just pictures, you need to use some brain power on this one as its up for interpretation, 3/5
Installation: here is where the interpretation comes into play.  they give you an alcohol wipe, good for removing fingerprints or light blemishes.  you could also use a good quality microfiber cloth made for glass. the drying pad is dumb, it is the same as the alcohol wipe pad, just dry, and all it does is smear around the leftover alcohol that hasn't yet evaporated.  the other thing they give you for the next step is simply a sticker that does not leave any sticky residue on the glass.  it is meant to lift off any hair or lint that may have fallen onto the glass.  hold your screen at an angle and use a close light source to view any micro particles that may need lifting.  I used this sticker and it gets stuck pretty good so make sure you have a good hold on it like the picture shows.
lastly we have the actual glass which I am inclined to believe is real glass with a thin layer a sub-adhesive to hold it together.  I gently and slowly peeled away the plastic sheet covering the adhesive side which really isn't that sticky, just enough to suction itself to your camera screen.
I laid it on one edge and slowly let the rest fall down watching the edges to make sure everything came down straight and even.  You will watch the protector pull itself down onto the screen as the color changes when the air is pushed out, you may have to go around the edges with your finger nail like I did to help force out some of the leftover air.  5/5

testing: I have gone through the pleasure of intentionally damaging the spare glass in the case because I have no need for a spare.  this is to see what kind of abuse it can take so I know what to expect.
holding the glass from both sides I slowly bent until it broke and shattered in the middle.  it actually bent a pretty good radius, farther than I would have thought to brake but of course this is a pretty thin piece.  once broken all pieces remained and nothing fell off or shot up in my face!
alright, now for the hammer.  I hit the remaining glass where it wasn't damaged from the previous test.  2 hits with the edge of the hammer and 2 hits with the face.  The edge hits cracked the glass with 1 strong hit while the face of the hammer took a couple hits to cause fracture.  Also I increased the force of each hit until the glass finally broke.  I believe that all of my impacts would far exceed dropping a camera from 4 or 5 feet accidentally.  even then, what are the odds your camera will land screen down?  unless you have the screen flexed out for optimal viewing then you might have more damage to worry about than a cracked screen.  this screen protector is really to help keep scratches off the glass which is already pretty hard, maybe not gorilla glass 4 hard but still hard enough if you keep it in a nice padded carrying case like I do.

if you really feel the need to protect your screen than this definitely won't hurt having it. always good to protect your investment in the event you want to sell the camera or trade it or hand it down to your children assuming technology hasn't made this camera obsolete in 5 years like our old one.",1
"The glass itself seems of pretty nice quality, all edges are smooth and soft. The only issue I had with it was after one wash (hand washing) some of the white lettering had chipped away a bit. It's not too noticeable but for an almost $19 mug I would expect all the letters to remain on. I have received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",1
Saves your fingers at the range.  Idk if its really faster or easier just easier on the fingers.,0
"These work fantastic! They are super light and the Bluetooth range is better than any other Bluetooth headphones I have tried. It paired easily with my Nexus 6p. I am no audiophile, but it sounds good to me. I tested it for phonecalls as well. The other party could hear me fine and I heard them great. I was fortunate enough to receive these headphones at a reduced price or for free with the purpose of testing and honestly reviewing. I recommend these. Super light, comfortable, stay in your ears and great Bluetooth range! Great job designing these.",1
"This was a great case for my first PC build. My only complaint is that the top panel that covers some I/O is not hinged on or anything. Its just a plate that you set on top of it when you want to cover up your I/O. I have more than once had to go looking around for where I misplaced it after using a USB jack.

I love the looks of the case and it seemed like a good price. It fits my needs well.",0
"Be careful. My printer did NOT accept this as a cartridge. It would not print. It kept telling me not a genuine HP cartridge. I could not go around it, even in settings. I am not sure if this is an HP thing strictly as I see from reviews that other people were able to get it to work. But in my home printer it did not. I am very sad about it because I was saving it as a spare for when I ran out and now I had to place an order for a same day delivery from amazon so I can get my shipped items out on time from my home based company. Total and complete bummer.

This is by far the best training collar I have used. I have used the shock bark collars before and I always felt bad about it. This collar uses beeps and vibration instead. I have a crazy pug named Gus. He is feisty and loves to bark at oh i don't know......EVERYTHING!! I keep this collar on him all the time. The battery lasts a few days at least depending on how naughty he is. The cord to change lets you charge the collar and the handset at the same time.

The collar has different setting for intensity and volume of the beeping. I don't have it above 3. The vibration is strong enough for him to get the message without giving him any pain. Gus is like one of our kids and we don't want him to feel any pain. You can control 2 collars from one handset and the backlit screen allows you to see it in any setting.

"These days, we all want to divorce ourselves with wired. We want everything to be wireless including our headphones. Jabra will soon release the wireless sports earbuds. These look very cool as they are just plain two earbuds that you put in your ears. This is all good until you lose an earbud or something fails with the Bluetooth hardware. That is when we revert back to our faithful wired headphones.
The Aukey EP-C7 is a nice backup headset considering its simplicity. If you were to compare it with the regular or manufactured ones, you will quickly notice it is set apart due to the various features.
We can start with comfort. It is very comfortable. The sure-fit arc design ear hooks fits nicely around the ear. The design of self-adjusting ear nozzles, and sweat proof materials (with multi-size silicone buds included) makes it ideal for ultimate comfort to match most active lifestyle. It stays around my ears during running, cleaning the house, walk in the neighborhood, and even used it to take a couple of phone calls.
Then, there is the performance which is fantastic. I have enjoyed some clarity sound and balance treble, midrange, bass that matches my other headphones, and the expensive ones too. A great benefit of wired is the fact it is plug and play and there is zero risk of skips or breaks. You get to enjoy your music.
Also, it offers the easy controls for hands-free call handling. I have used it for a couple of phone calls and it was good. Keep in mind, you will need to control the volume from your phone. It does not have the expected control to increase and decrease the volume.
I have truly enjoyed these headphones and would recommend them to anyone.

Love this shirt.  Fits well and is light and not see through at all.  I bought this to wear to a picnic and wore with my yoga pants.  Looked great and kinda sporty.  It was really hot and humid this weekend but this shirt keeped me cool and dry.  Very happy with my purchase and will buy more soon.,0
"My family loves this virtual reality headset. It is very comfortable with the cushion around the headset and is adjustable to your liking. It also has a Built IPD and a Focal Distance Adjustment. You can download apps off of your phone. The picture was even better with our iPhone 6 since you can fully encase your phone inside of it. It works well with 3D games and movies. I am afraid of rollercoaster so this was a great alternative to that. You do want to be cautious of moving around since you might get dizzy and bump into doors and walls (ask my son lol) but its made out of hard plastic so it didn't break. Its cheaper than going to the movies or an amusement park. It did come with a Bluetooth remote controller but we could only get it to turn the volume on and off. This is a great step into virtual reality for you and children and a great way to keep everyone entertained on a rainy day.

"This is awesome.  I bought it for hiking and just wearing around the house.  It's super soft, stretchy and comfortable.  Headbands usually give me headaches, but I forget this one is on.

"I bought these so my cords would be a bit more durable against our new kitten and my 2 year old daughter. The first cord I took out to try wouldn't work at all. I was kind of displeased with this. The rest all work fine though! I love all of the colors, it helps keep our phones separate since they are the same phone. I dislike the shortness of these cords though, I have mine right next to my bed and it is still hard to use for me, I am used to a longer cord for my phone.

"This shirt feels identical to any expensive button down shirt you would pick off the shelf at any department store. It is a nice quality shirt that looks very well made and fits great. The XL fit my 6'2 boyfriend very well and gave him a lot of room to move and stretch his arms without feeling confined. The characteristics of the fabric and its lightweight nature also allowed him to stay cool when necessary, but warm if he needed to.

The shirts colors are a little darker than what is pictured in the photo, but I really enjoy the pattern. It is different from all this cookie cutter plaid shirts you see everywhere else, because this one has some diagonal stripes and things which differentiate it. I personally like it because it if I am going to spend money on a new a different shirt I do not want it to look nearly identical to something that my boyfriend already has in his own closet.

Overall, I would say this shirt is a win! I did receive this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The opinions that I expressed above are those that I truly felt after seeing the product and feeling the quality of the fabric. Personally, I think this shirt is a great way to get bang for your buck and look forward to purchasing more shirts from this seller in the future because I know they will make great gifts for my boyfriend!",1
"These are top quality luggage tags. They are modern and contemporary looking. It has a spot for the name, address, phone, and email. They are made of high quality aluminum material.

"One of my favorite things about these measuring spoons is that they are so narrow! I have other measuring spoons that do not fit into my spice jars, but these most definitely do! Another thing that I like is that they are attached together by a nice ring. I do have the option of removing them from the ring if I want, but I would rather keep them together so that I never have to worry about one getting misplaced or lost. Another wonderful thing about this set is that I now have a  and a  measuring spoon which are so handy. Ive always wondered why other measuring spoon sets didn't include these sizes, but now I finally have a sturdy, fabulous, beautiful set that does! I have bought plenty of cheaper sets in the past, but Im so glad that I spent more for this quality set. In fact, Im so happy with these that Im getting rid of my cheap ones.  I've ran these through the dishwasher several times since my initial review and they have been holding up wonderfully, no water spots, no rust. Still in perfect condition. These are the best spoons I've ever purchased! I cannot say that enough! I bought this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",1

"So far - so good!
I got this cell phone charger (power bank) on Friday, and here it is Tuesday already, and I've been successfully using it to charge my phone, as well as my bluetooth speaker, all weekend During the 4th of July activities away from home.
These are invaluable when you have a power outage as well, as I do have another one, and keep it charged up, so in the event of power failure, we can still charge our phones with it. Any time you're away from home, without a source of power (camping, hiking, picnics) it's a good idea to have a charged cell phone. I primarily used this during the picnic, and kept my cell phone charged with it so I could record the fireworks.
It charged quickly and easily with the cord included, via my USB port on the computer.  So far I've used this for only two items, a cell phone and a small speaker, but I'm sure it can be used for ipod and ipad just as well. We both have the Iphone 6, and it worked great, and boosted my phone battery 5 points in less than 5 minutes. Within an hour I was at 90%!

"This review is for G Med Women's Mock Wrap back tie printed scrub set, this set is very cute! I  am not currently working in the medical field but I  do wear scrubs to run errands and clean around the house. The sizing chart needs to be followed because these run small based on US standards.

"Up until receiving this product, I have been using a neoprene running sleeve to secure my phone to my bike during rides. I absolutely love having this mounted phone holder because it allows for way more functionality without having to stop. For example, if I wanted to change the song, I'd have to come to full stop, and then lean over to see the screen. Likewise if I wanted to pause whatever ride tracking app I was using. With this mount, though, I can do all of that while simply slowing down. I must admit, it is a bit scary having my phone just sitting there without a case on it (I've found that most cases will make the phone too big to fit), but clamps hold it nice and tight. I didn't find much security in the four corner bands simply because of the phone's size. It made it seem like they were ready to slip off at a moment's notice. Fortunately, they didn't come off until I manually took them off, although, at that point, they came off very easily. Mounting this thing to the handle bars is extremely easy as well. The twist knob makes it effortless to tighten or loosen the clamp so it isn't a hassle to take it off and put it back on again. I would definitely recommend taking it off if you stop and lock your bike up somewhere, since it could be taken off by anybody without tools. As a disclaimer, I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I would definitely recommend this mount or at least this type of mount if you're cyclist looking for an easy way to secure your phone while riding, though.",1

"I purchased the necklace and bracelet set in black with silver and am very happy with the quality and look. They have a boho look with unique elegant features. The silver strands slide on the black threads (they are not stuck in place), so the bracelet has a dynamic look as you move your wrist. At the same time, these silver tubes seem to slide together, so they look fairly aligned even as they move. Because the necklace lays more static around the neck, the silver appears more fixed, even though those slide as well. The magnetic clasps are easy to click together (I don't have to call my husband in the room and ask him to mess with a lobster claw clasp). I can wear these with a wide range of fashions, from casual days at the beach to workdays and nights on the town. I particularly like how they look with sleeveless tops, but you can create whatever fashion combinations happen to be your style. I received this jewelry set at a discount for an honest review, and I honestly love both pieces. Will wear them often.",1
"Very nice sturdy shower caddy!  Some of the nice features include:  an extra hook that you can use to hang it from a shower door if you want and circular holes in the top shelf that allow you to put shampoo / soap bottles in it upside for when you're trying to get that last bit of use!  The metal used to make the shelves feels sturdy (which isn't always the case with these kind of caddies).  Would purchase again!

"Love this glass beverage container!  This is made of Borosilicate, which is the same type of glass that is used in Pyrex.  It's heat resistant, so you can put hot or cold beverages in the canister with no issues.  The Silikote protection is very attractive.  I got the sea green color, and love the look.  The feel of the Silikote is almost soft and silky.  I end up running my thumb on the canister while I'm holding it because I love the feel.  It comes with a very attractive stainless steel cap.  Has a great look to it.

I wish they would have made the cap so that the track it screws onto was on the inside of the bottle.

"I don't think these are real Under Armour socks. The material is thin and two socks had holes in them. Quality is definitely sub-par.

**** Updated. I originally ordered these in May 2016. Even though they were terrible quality, my son loved them,  so I ordered again in September 2016. The second time, I received great quality socks that were in typical Under Armour packaging. The second order socks are thicker, better quality and do not pill like the first set did.

"I was so excited for this and so disappointed in it. I love the idea, I love the design. You can take out the earphone part to wash the headband. It is kind of adjustable but that is where we had our issue. I tried these on first to see where the ear pieces where and if it would get too loud for my kids. I had to move the ear pieces because they were too far apart to be even near my ears. This was hard to do myself. Then my son tried them on, he is 8 and of course his head is smaller so we adjusted the speaker part again and it broke. One ear is still attached but the other the wire is out and there is no fixing this. I fell like they either didn't take into account everyone has a different head size and would need to be more easily adjusted or they just were not made well enough to handle a child. An adult, maybe if they are careful with them but what child will be super still and make sure not even to tug the wires? That's pretty much all that happened, a small tug and it pulled out. I do live the design and the idea but they just aren't made well enough for kids in my opinion. We may just pull the speaker out and use the frog for a headband for my daughter.

"I got this trekking pole mainly for my wife. She was in a car wreck and messed up her knees and hips. She struggles going for hikes with me now and usually if she goes she is in a lot of pain and loses her balance. Having this pole is nice for my wife because she is able to take some of the strain off her joints when she is hiking. She still struggles, and is in pain but not near as bad. Having this pole has made it so she can actually enjoy going for hikes with me. She has better balance, and does not twist her ankles as much as well. My little girl loves using this pole as well. It is light and easy to use. My daughter doesn't need it but loves taking it out with us and uses it like mommy. The pole is easy to put together when using it. When done using it can collapse it down to about a foot. I love how small it goes down to. It doesn't take up very much space when traveling.

"This is, beyond any doubt, the best new invention placed on the earth........Oil from any of our herbs in just 10 mins ????? WOW..
May I inquire,,,,, what, besides butter or hemp oil, is a good carrier oil for massage???
I use the hemp oil however I do find some people are allergic to hemp. When using coconut oil the cool oil will harden and I must warm it up to apply it.  It also clogs up the machine and take many many reuses to rid the machine of all the coconut oil.
I have discovered a plant (from the rain forest) that stops the pain in joints as we get older, Arthritis or just getting old, I have been eating this plant for over 20 yrs and it keeps me pain free, and the use of the oil on the surface of the skin is a great anti-inflammatory and much like the tin man in Wizard of Oz, our joints need oiling to stop hurting......Chiropractors must reduce any swelling around the joint in order to adjust it.  Apply the cardio-oil to the surface and wait ten minutes to adjust easily.",0
"The EEZ-Y Double Canopy Wind Resistant Travel Umbrella is well made, well designed and compact when not in use. When the umbrella is opened it is the size of the standard umbrella. When it is not in use, it fits easily into a purse or tote and is not obtrusive at all.

Living in eastern Georgia, we have frequent rain storms in the spring and summer months. I received this new umbrella just in time for its use during a few of these summer storms. This is the first double canopy umbrella design I have ever tried and it does seem less resistant to being pulled and tugged by the wind while in use than some of the other umbrellas that I have owned and used in the past.

While it is lightweight, it does seem sturdily made and is not flimsy. It is easy to open and close and comes with a slipcover to keep it covered when it is not in use. The colors are bright and vibrant. It is an attractive umbrella and its compact design allows for it to be tucked away unobtrusively in your automobile or handbag.  .

"This product was received discounted, but only if I am to give an unbiased personal review. I am in no way affiliated with the seller or company. All opinions are that of my own (positive and negative).

Okay so before I had a rubbery case which I had a lot of issues pulling in and out of my pocket and it seemed to cling any kind of small dirt so I was super happy when I received this case

Pros: It has a great design, fits snug, and is extremely clear. This case can be used for any gender. It Is very thin and makes it easy to slide in and out of my pocket or purse. The hard rubber (the black areas on the case) did give it a little more traction in my hands so that it wasn't too slick or slippery, which would make me drop it.

Cons: It fits a little too snug, Every time I go to take my phone out of the case it literally detaches the back of my phone (battery cover). This can be construed as a pro or con depending on the user (for me it was annoying). I am not super confident that if my phone were dropped this would do much as far as protecting it from the shock. The clear area of the phone case does show smudges and fingerprints.",1

This is beautiful hardware. It is sturdy with a great finish. Once installed, I have found it to be perfectly functional as well.

I am a DIY and learn as I go. I spent days reading and re-reading the instructions and looking at the pictures. I search videos online and watch a couple of those. However, I still was concerned at the directions offering me measurements in mm with conversion of things like 1.7"" (I mean what does that even mean?). Finally, it was time to just install the hardware and door and not worry about the directions. The only directions I actually followed was the spacing for the track. And I still completed the installation is less than 4 hours; at least 45 minutes of that time was to make adjustment to my old door. I was shocked by how easy this was to install! I just wish the instructions had been clearer so I would not have spent all that time worrying about how to install it.

If you are looking for barn door hardware I say this is a great choice. It is beautiful, the door opens and closes seamlessly and quietly. We are grateful to have this in our home. Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.",1

"I own many watches with genuine leather straps and also own a few watches that say they are genuine leather and are not. There is a noticeable difference between the 2. This accessory band IS genuine leather. In fact it is one of the better ones i have, and now its on my wearable, Fitbit Blaze. First off, it is very supple, and soft. Can easily be worn every day/night without irritation like some poly bands.

Second, the springs in the pins that hold it onto the Fitbit are very secure and even after some pretty rigorous workouts, never had an issue popping out.

I have this in Blue and Red, that is how much I love it.

I also tried this band on another watch with removeable bands and it worked great also. Just needs to be the right size case.

Overall very satisfied with this purchase and frankly surprised at the quality of an inexpensive genuine leather band. Good Job

"This is two panels of  mesh fabric with magnets sewn into the interior finished edges in order to create a flexible screen which automatically snaps shut after you walk through it. For installation, it comes with long strips of Velcro with adhesive on the back. I will say that I did not use that for my installation onto a doorway between my utility room and garage because I rent and didn't want to have to clean off the residue from removing the Velcro in the future nor to risk damage to the paint. I can say with confidence that this installs very well just by using thumb tacks at equal, but not frequent, intervals.

There are some important points for getting the screen to work well in terms of the magnets automatically closing the screen panels. They primarily relate to hanging it such that the bottom doesn't drag on the floor and you hang it evenly with no gaps along the top or sides. If it drags on the ground, it won't close properly at the bottom. I was lucky because the doorway I hung it on has a lower step under it so there was no risk of it dragging (though, honestly, the length was precisely right for my doorway so it wouldn't have dragged anyway). I also was careful to hang it fairly taut when I put in the thumb tacks (and I anchored the sides as well as the top with tacks).

My screen has snapped shut perfectly all but one time so far. The bottom failed to completely close once, but that related to hanging around in the doorway for a long time rather than just walking through. I will say that , with my situation (hanging lower step and a door frame that is jutting out from the door itself by about an inch or two), there is a gap along the bottom between the step and the screen. This is absolutely no issue with the product, but just that, if you're hanging the screen in a similar situation, you will have the same gap and not 100% protection from insects as you would have with a real screen door, but it is unlikely that flying insects will get in via that route so I'm not overly concerned about it. That being said, I think that a metal strip at the bottom might encourage it to stick to the bottom as well as the magnets would snap to that as well, but it's more effort than I'm willing to go to to cover the gap.

In terms of comparing this to a real screen door, this has some merits and some demerits. The primary merit is that it is amazingly easy to install. Other merits are that it doesn't require people to manually close it as it auto-closes and it is often the case that people fail to close screen doors (I know I sometimes leave mine open accidentally then it bangs in the wind until I close it). If you want a breeze through the doorway, this provides full permeability rather than partial. In my case, this is also a temporary alteration of a rental property and is easy to put in and take out without visible damage. Finally, it is generally a lot cheaper than a conventional screen door and it provides full visibility throughout the length of the doorway. It also can function as a pet door if you can train your pet to walk through it. The demerits are that I'd be shocked if this had the same longevity as a real door as it is made of woven fabric. I think that, if you have cats, it could also be a magnet for scratching or climbing and it would just get shredded (unlike a real screen door).

In terms of value, this is my only experience with this type of magnetic screen door so I can't speak to how its quality compares. I can say that it works very well and is near the middle of the pack price-wise at the time of this review with this item being priced at $24 and the cheaper ones being around $16 and more expensive ones being around $40. It seems that, since this works well and the price is modest, this would represent adequate value.

"I did NOT receive a sample, I did NOT get compensated, and I did NOT receive a discounted version. I paid full price. I've never had any contact with the company. That's why this review isn't 5 stars like the rest. Congratulations, you found the only honest review of this product.

That said, there are some problems.

For reference, this was purchased for a Raspberry Pi 3, specifically to use Kodi through LibreELEC (and, occasionally Raspbian). I'm going to do some general comparisons to the generic mini keyboard with a similar form factor that you can find from a variety of different vendors in different colors and models (notably has round ""thumbpads"" for directional control). LiiR sells their version here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LiiR-mini-keyboard-back/dp/B01FJMJQ4E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LiiR mini keyboard (back)</a>&nbsp;and I have this version by Rii:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rii-Mini-Bluetooth-Touchpad-Keyboard-for-PC-PAD-360XBox-PS3-Google-Android-TV-Box-HTPC-IPTV-White-i8-BT/dp/B00JO80LTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rii Mini Bluetooth Touchpad Keyboard for PC/PAD/360XBox/PS3/Google Android TV Box/HTPC/IPTV, White (i8 BT)</a>. It is the same exact thing that's sold by tons of other companies on Amazon, so I bought this one to see if it was any better (having already owned a generic Bluetooth one for a while). Some photos also show my old workhorse:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/QQ-Tech-Mini-Bluetooth-Keyboard-W-Touchpad-for-Android-OS-Windows/dp/B00BALK9CM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">QQ-Tech Mini Bluetooth Keyboard W Touchpad for Android OS Windows</a>, which sadly died after 2 years due to a broken trackpad. However, it had the mouse click bumper buttons that I really liked, which drove me to this LiiR model. Moving on!

PROS:
- Nice and chunky, feels a lot better in the hand than the generic one. This could pass for a cheap little gaming controller if you wanted to do keybindings for it.
- ""Bumper"" buttons for mouse (L and R click), which are hard to find, are a lot nicer for mouse navigation. They have a very solid press to them, too. (These are the only parts of the unit that have surprisingly good build quality, unfortunately.)
- Very lightly backlit, just enough to see in absolute darkness. Bright enough to not be distracting.
- Connects instantaneously, which is good because Bluetooth has a slow reconnection process (see 2.4G note below).
- Indicator LEDs are not obnoxiously bright, which was a problem on the QQ-Tech.
- Buttons are a lot more rubberized than the lightly-rubberized ones on the generic models.

PROS/CONS (can go either way):
- 2.4G wireless with tiny USB receiver, so it shows up as a wired keyboard. This is particularly important for Pi users because NOOBS (the bootloader) doesn't work with Bluetooth keyboards, so you'll need a ""wired"" keyboard to change operating systems. Kodi also takes a little while to ""restart"" Bluetooth connections, so if you have a Bluetooth keyboard that turns itself off, it takes a few seconds to get it working again. The downside is that you have to take up a USB port, which is a problem if you've got a tablet or a laptop with few ports (or just one!).
- Charges over micro USB instead of mini USB like most other models. Really only a pro if you already have a bunch of micro chargers laying around (you probably do) since almost nothing nowadays uses mini.
- Battery is replaceable, but the unit will probably die before the battery does (as most other mini keyboards I've used have).
- No dedicated F-keys - you need to use Fn. If you use F-key keybinds, this is a pain, and it is impossible to use the F-keys + Ctrl or Alt. However, it does free up a lot of space so the rest of the buttons are nice and big.
- Manual references an air mouse feature and the unit has a button to toggle it, but it doesn't seem to work. Maybe it does, but I couldn't figure it out since it doesn't do anything. The manual references specific model numbers with and without air mouse, but those numbers aren't listed anywhere in the Amazon listing. Fair enough, I'm not expecting Wiimote levels of interactivity here.
- Not really a fan of the diamond thumbpad layout. It would be better of the buttons were somewhat rounded, but I get that they're trying to distinguish themselves.

CONS:
- The biggest one first - phantom key presses. I can't nail this glitch down, but I know it's specific to this unit, because other 2.4G keyboards (and Bluetooth keyboards) don't have the same problem. Sometimes, it will just randomly spit out a couple of arrow keys or mash Esc or Backspace without actually touching any buttons. I have no clue why this happens, but it makes navigating Kodi (not to mention playing files) basically impossible at times, because it'll just randomly skip around or exit to the main menu unless you physically turn it off. This is the reason I've switched back to a generic Bluetooth while using Kodi, but I keep this around for NOOBS (see the 2.4G note above). Read the other critical reviews and you'll see this is a common problem (even for some of the discounted reviewers!). That's because people who actually use this product will notice it, while many of the 5-star discounted reviewers just throw it up on eBay to pawn it off at full price (making a profit) without actually testing it. Welcome to Amazon!
- Key presses sometimes do not register, even when pressed one after the other. This is rare, though.
- Certain buttons have little creaks and snaps that signal to me poor build quality (particularly the arrow keys).
- Top of the trackpad is actually indented, as if the trackpad itself was pushed into the unit, but the plastic layer on top of it is still attached to the edges so there's just an awkward bump. Another build quality issue. See the photos for a closeup of this. You can actually see this if you look closely in the photos on the discounted reviews too, yet they didn't mention it!
- There are two fake AAA holders (one on either side of the unit in the back) with no metal contacts. It would be nice to be able to put AAA's in here, I suppose... if they worked.
- The covers for the AAA holders are very loose and wiggle around.
- The actual battery cover in the back is incorrectly molded - it is curved too much, so the edges on the sides are jutting out. Again, poor build quality. Again, see the photos. You can see this on the discounted reviews' photos too.
- A lot of little seams and nubs all over the place from the molding process, notably on the top and bottom. Once more, poor build quality.
- The three-fingered tap to right click doesn't work. The two-fingered scroll barely works and is ridiculously fast.

SUMMARY:
I wish I could have liked this unit because those bumper buttons really do it for me, and they'd be great if you wanted to map them to Retropie. But all of the tiny faults - and especially the huge phantom key glitch - make it a no-go for me. I've decided to keep it for navigating the RPi if Bluetooth isn't available, but I've gone back to the generic model for everyday use at this point because the phantom keys make Kodi impossible to use.

I would not recommend this product with these issues. I hope LiiR (or whichever manufacturer they're buying from) can get a new fixed model out someday because I really do prefer the form factor compared to the others. In the meantime, spend a couple of extra bucks and get something else from a marginally more reputable brand - maybe even one that doesn't spam the review system with discounted reviews. That'll be the day.",1

"I really like these self adhesive cover ups Reusable Pasties - Best Nipple Cover Ups - Adhesive Silicone Petals - Set of 2.  I have bought other versions of cover up pads in the past and this set of 2 is up to par.  I like the size of these pads which is smaller than other versions I have purchased in the past.  They are a true 2.5 inches in diameter as stated in the listing.  Womens clothing just plain out has several instances (backless, plunging neck line, strappy options) where you cannot wear a standard bra or even strapless bra, so these cover up pads are a perfect solution.  I always keep these type of cover up pads in my closet and they are a life saver.  I especially love that these are reusable up to 60 times.  I have not worn them 60 times, but either way they will last a long time even if its not a true 60.

I have attached several pictures.  The first picture shows the size of the cover up pads in my hand which is a nice smaller size and is this size I was expecting.  I have also attached a picture which shows the packaging that these pads came in.  Bottom line, this set of 2 cover up pads should be a staple in everyones closet, I am super happy I purchased this item, and I would recommend them.

"This a very good looking affordable alternative to the expensive iPod! I was actually quite surprised that its exterior did not at all look like a cheap knock-off! In fact, when I ask people... they mistake this for the iPod itself! But onto the function of the mp3 player, remind yourself that this is a very cheap alternative and to lower expectations. Yes, it is functional. But if you're used to an iPod, you might find yourself having your patience tested a bit because the buttons do totally different things than your typical iPod. Although, you can read about it in the manual to ease yourself into using this, for sure. Also, the program is definitely visually different... it even reminds me of a really old computer software. It comes with an okay set of earphones and its cable while coming in its very budget-conscious packaging (no problem with the product despite that).

I'm giving this four stars because I love that you get a functional and decent quality mp3 player that does not look cheap at all for a very affordable price. Yes, it may be slightly difficult to navigate in the beginning, but you'll eventually get used to it. If you don't care about anything fancy and you just want to save your money, try this!

I have no complaints really, except it would be nice if it was rhodium plated.

Okay, so what I like:

*quality. When I first looked at this immediately I was drawn to the quality of it. It looks great and clearing was manufactured well.

*enamel. The blue enamel looks great. It has a nice rich color and the enamel looks as if it will last for a long time..

*sparkles. The bead will definitely catch the light and sparkle as you wear it.

*bead size. It's a great size bead. It has a nice chunky look to it without being overly bulky.

*versatile. Due to the size of the opening this bead can be worn on a bracelet with other beads or on a necklace. It's definitely (IMHO) substantial enough to be worn alone as a small pendant.

*marked with s925 to signify it is sterling silver.

*seller is a member of the amazon fine jewelry category. This means they have exemplary quality with exacting standards and this piece shows it.

*polishing cloth. There is a small cloth included which I believe is a polishing cloth. I intend to contact the seller and find out for sure.

Okay, so what I like less:

*The silver isn't rhodium plated which would prevent tarnishing. It would be my preference for this to be rhodium plated but your mileage may vary.

Overall, this bead is pretty awesome. I think it will make its way onto a necklace and be worn as a pendant. I received this product at a discounted or free rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and there you have it.  A sparkly, well made bead that exudes quality. If I was to nitpick I'd say it isn't rhodium plated but there is a polishing cloth included.

5/5 definitely. I'm sorry my pictures don't do the bead justice at all. Hopefully this was helpful.",1

"You can never have too many power adapters especially since almost every device charge with a USB adapter. This one is nice to have either at home or when you travel. What is nice about this one is that it has two USB ports. I always have one along when I travel to someone elses house as I always have more than one device along. The only device that I have that I can not use one of these adapters for is my iPad 3. No matter, that used a different type of adapter.

"I was going to give this set 4 stars, but based on what you get for the price I think it earned 5 stars!

Two panels for under $20. Great material, nicely crafted, and it's thin so it brightens a room. See photo for what my room looked like before I changed the panels. This set has both a silk and linen look. It's see through, so I moved it from my bedroom to my living room, because I like to sleep in pitch black, and this allows the moonlight to seep through. I wish they were available in sage, but I will be ordering it in brown to blend the earth tones in my formal living room. Really nice set.

"I'm not one to want to buy fancy headphones or fancy anything for that matter but I stumbled upon these headphones and wanted to give them a try, See if they were really all they are made out to be. Well I've got great news!! They are amazing!! The protective carrying case they came in is amazing. Perfect for keeping them covered and put of from the kiddos. The quality of the sounds is so cool. My younger son told me it sounds like he's in a theatre when he uses them to watch a movie. I love hooking them right up to my favorite andriod phone and putting on some tunes and tuning out the world with my favorite music and sounding at its best. I've used beats headphones before and they are just as good in my book and a better price!! Very well made!

"Simple practical sun hat. This hat is absolutely squish proof unlike all my past hats. I used to have quite a collection, but one day my dog decided he was going to eat them all and now I am hatless which is really only a problem when I want to keep sun out of face when hiking in the summer or freezing my ears off in my jeep in the winter. This hat helps one of those things. It's seriously packable, I've folded it up in luggage a bunch already, which is nice and I'd say it's one size fits most women.

I wear about a medium hat and this is fine, but it definitely wouldn't fit my husband's head so if you're a dude with a similarly huge head you may be out of luck.

It's made of a lightweight breathable material and has a wired rim for shaping, but it's much more functional than it is a fashion statement. I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review, hope it was helpful.",1
"I really love this shirt. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because I don't like how low it is. The shirt is super cute, but if you don't tie the strings around your neck tight enough, it falls so low you can see almost all of your bra. It is also very low in the back. It's impossible to wear a bra with it. However, if you tie the strings right, it is a very adorable shirt for going out!

"This is the first ring I ever bought and was afraid at first about whether it would be comfortable or not, and after wearing it for two weeks, I have no regrets buying this ring. It is not too thick to the point where it feels uncomfortable on your finger and doesn't feel heavy on your hand. It took me some time to get used to the feeling of having a ring on my finger, but it was really easy to adjust to. It didn't turn out too big and wasn't extremely tight to the point of feeling like circulation in my finger was cut off. However, most likely because I've never worn a ring before, it has felt slightly itchy after wearing it for extended periods of time, and so I would have to remove it every so often to relieve my fingers.

It has an elegant band design that I think is suited for those who like these types of designs. While it is labeled as a wedding ring, it can be worn as a regular ring as well. It's also a bonus to have lifetime exchange in case the ring does not fit well.

Since this is a jewelry/accessory, it would have been nice for it to be in a better packaging than it came in, such as a small case or pouch. It was shipped in just a simple, small plastic zip-lock baggie.

I received this product at a discounted price. All reviews are honest and unbiased, and I do not recommend anything I would not personally use or is poor in quality.",1

"All of the 6 TVs in our house are mounted on the wall.  This TV mount was by far the easiest one to install.  There is a built in level to insure it's mounted straight.
The set includes all of the hardware you need to install it including several types and sizes of screws to fit the screw holes on different types of televisions.
To hang the TV, screw 2 brackets on the back of the TV.  Mount the wall bracket on the wall and hook the TV on it by the brackets.
Once mounted, the TV will fully articulate.  It's on an arm so it can be pulled out from the wall and adjusted to your viewing preferences.

"This outfit was packaged well, arrived quickly, and was exactly as described.

I am absolutely in love with this outfit! It is well made and everything fits perfectly. I have a ""healthy"" 7 month old and I ordered the 9-12 month size and it fits great! The pants were a bit long, but as soon as I put her sandals on you could not tell. She normally wears 9 month in carters clothing so I would say this is pretty true to size!

She has worn it once and was in the baby carrier for half the time. People were constantly commenting on how cute her headband and matching pants were. We were at a festival for an hour and a half and she probably got at least 10 compliments on the headband alone!
I would purchase this again and again. It is super adorable and my baby seems to think its pretty comfy as well :)

"Let me start by saying, I LOVE these socks!

I like to wear no-show socks often, but the socks that I've had in the past tend to work down into my shoes. These socks definitely do not do this. They stay put where they should, and the result is wonderful!

The top of the sock is very thin - so thin that you can see your skin tone through the mesh. Honestly, I really don't know whether this is a good thing or not, but it doesn't bother me in the least. The sole, or bottom, is the thickness you'd expect from an athletic sock and substantially more robust than the top.

You can kinda see in the pictures, but the heel area has extra padded fabric around the opening. This is why the sock doesn't slip down into your shoes. This is what makes these socks practical.

I'm also please to say that I've gotten no color bleed from these black socks. No fuzz on my toes and no color in my shoes.

Lastly, and my only issue with the socks, is the branding across the top of the socks. ""Soft Breath"" is the company name, so it's hard to complain about that being on your socks. On the other hand, if you're going to be among guys in a competitive environment, ""Soft Breath"" ain't winning you any favors. Likely, it'll win you some spirited jeering in that crowd.

Personally, I wear them at home and when I will not be removing my shoes.

Bottom line: I love these socks, but I don't want to show them off.

"I bought these to make snowflake shaped soaps to give as Christmas gifts this Christmas.  However, the actual snowflake is kind of blunted without much definition.  I have other snowflake molds that make wonderful snowflake shaped soaps but I wanted some variety so I bought these.  The soaps are plenty big, and they come out of the mold easily so there is nothing to complain about there.  The silicone is great too and easy to wash.  I just am disappointed with the clarity of the various snowflake cuts.  I'll still use them, but they'll be for left over soap batter after the better molds are filled up.",0

"The youtube videos make it seem so easy to inflate and set up.  Unfortunately the reality is not nearly as easy as one would think.  It definitely takes practice and patience before you even approach getting the hang of this.  When we finally did manage to inflate it enough to be able to sit on it, it slowly leaked out air so that soon it was completely deflated.  As a disclaimer I do live in the desert where right now we do not have a lot of wind.  As such we had to literally run down the street in an effort to get any air in there at all.  Even then it took multiple tries before we managed to inflate the bag maybe 1/3rd of the way.  Exhausting!

We are hoping that with practice we will succeed in making this work.  After trying for a few days we just got too frustrated to keep on trying.  We will give it another go on a day when we have some winds and will update my review if we are more successful.

"Unfortunately, while this giant marimo seemed fine when it first arrived, trouble ensued when I started to move it. When I first took the marimo out of the plastic container to transfer it to its new home, it was obviously quite delicate, and felt weirdly squishy. I gently rinsed it before placing it in clean water, and thats when the trouble started. The marimo, while quite large, was also hollow on the inside, and fell apart easily into many smaller marimo balls. I didn't pull on it or treat it roughly; the moss just started breaking apart while I was gently squeezing it while cleaning, which is what you're supposed to do to clean marimos. I have two other marimos that did not have this problem, nor did the two smaller marimos that came with the giant marimo have any issues. I have the smaller pieces in three glass containers now, and I had to spend a lot of time forming the bits of moss that broke off into balls (or as close to sphere-shaped as I could get them). Perhaps this is normal with the giant ones, in which case there should be instructions included warning people to be extra careful and not squeeze them in case they fall apart.

To be fair, I had planned on breaking the giant marimo into smaller ones anyway, but for anyone wanting a giant marimo for an aquarium or other large container, either steer clear of this brand or be extra careful when handling it.

"Hello this is Erica the reviewer once again with another product review!
And today I will be reviewing this French press coffee maker. I have received this product afew weeks ago and I wanted to really try it out before writing this review. The first thing I noticed upon opening the box is the quality of this French press. It is chrome colored and has the company logo on the side. The chrome color gives this French press a very premium feel. The French press has a double insulated wall that does not allow you to get burned when touching the outer wall of the French press. In the box came a spoon to scoop the coffee and also mix it. A filter mesh and also the French press. This is honestly by far the best French press I have ever used. The quality of the coffee when brewed with this machine is amazing, it makes the coffee taste so fresh. For me this French press has no con, simply because it meets all of my coffee needs.
I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not modified due to the fact that the product was discounted.

"This is a wonderful garden hose set! It comes with everything that you can possibly need to keep your yard and garden nice and hydrated this summer! there is a nice quality, very well made water hose, which expands when water is flowing through it and it contracts back to a very small size when not in use. the hose is seventy five feet long and also has an off and on flow switch that is super easy to use, simply twist it and the water flows or stops depending on the way that you have it turned. There is also an awesome sprayer that comes with the set. The sprayer has a comfort grip on the handle as well as the trigger. There are also different variations of sprays on the spray nozzle, simply turn until you find the one that you are happy with.  I love that it takes up a small amount of space but extends to the length of a full size hose when filled with water.
I will be buying another one for the front yard.

"I've recently been making heavy use of my Surface 3 tablet and have found that there are times the touch-pad on the keyboard just doesn't do the job of a mouse.  At my desktop I've long preferred a wired mouse because of my occasional gaming sessions, but since I already carry around too many cords when traveling with the Surface, I thought I'd try a wireless mouse.  This Bestfire unit fills the role of ""travel mouse"" perfectly thanks to its small size.  Next to my gaming mouse this thing is tiny, although it weighs about the same amount thanks to the battery.  What makes it travel so well though is the mouse's slim profile; it's much flatter than a typical desktop mouse.  The wireless receiver for the mouse is similarly tiny, barely protruding out from a USB port.

The build and materials of this mouse are all pretty good.  The soft-feeling matte finish on the mouse provides good grip and resists finger prints.  The left and right buttons both have a nice tactile click to them, but make almost no noise when operated, so using it doesn't draw attention in a meeting.  The click-wheel also has a nice clicking action, although using it for a middle click is just a bit stiffer than I'd like.  There's also a DPI button that effectively toggles between a slow and fast pointer speed when using the mouse.  The flat profile of this mouse will work best for those who use their fingers to move the mouse.  Those who are used to resting their palm on top on the mouse and pushing it around with their whole hand may find it takes some adjustment to feel comfortable.  Over the years, I've used both styles and had no problems feeling right at home with this one.

There were no instructions included with this mouse, but none are really necessary.  Getting started with it simply requires plugging the receiver into a USB port, waiting for the computer to recognize and auto-magically load the appropriate drivers, and then turning on the switch underneath the mouse.  I will note it took my Windows 7 desktop install a few minutes to locate the appropriate driver which is a bit unusual, but it never required any input from me to complete the installation, everything was automatic, just a bit slow.  The Surface's Windows 10 had no problems or delay recognizing the new hardware.

The internal but removable lithium-ion battery is charged via a mini-USB cable.  I would have preferred if it had used the now more common micro-USB plug so that I could just use the same cable I use with my phone and several other devices.  The range on this mouse seems more than adequate.  I tested it in a conference room, a good 10 feet away from the receiver and it still produced smooth scrolling action.  Over several days of usage I had no issue getting the mouse to start up or

I notice there are quite a few negative reviews here so perhaps there is some variability to the build quality.  I can only comment on the example I received, which is great and will be my go-to travel mouse for the foreseeable future.

"I purchased this silicone wedding ring to wear instead of my diamond engagement ring and wedding band, after very nearly losing my bands in the foam pit at my child's gymnastic gym. After four years of marriage, my wedding ring had begun to fit loosely, and was constantly spinning around annoyingly on my finger. Because I don't work a job that necessitates non-metal jewelry, I went back and forth with the idea of purchasing new rings or having mine resized, but decided instead to purchase this silicone wedding ring to wear most of the time. I work as a nanny, so I wear this most days, and my diamond rings at night if we go somewhere special.

I love the look of this ring, with the color detail stripe. It fits very well, and it's rather sturdy silicone so it holds its shape. It never so much as scoots down my finger, even when my hands are wet. I highly recommend one of these if you're looking to an alternative to a metal ring.

"These booties are beautiful and extremely comfortable. They go very well with dresses and skirts. I purchased a pair in suede black, size 7 and they fit great. I will recommend getting these booties in the size you will usually go for in the stores. They have a little allowance in its size but not that much that it will slip off. The front of my feet are broad and because of that little allowance in its size,  it makes wearing them feel really comfortable! The top of the booties can be a little stiff but it does not bother me. I have been wearing them for almost a month now on all weekends and I still love them!

"This is a review for the Amourri Women Retro Vintage Cute Hollow Out One Piece Bathing Suits Swimsuit (FBA).

I purchased the black color swimsuit with a medium size. I didn't expect to receive such a nice looking and good quality textile at a very reasonable price. The design is really what is seen in the photo. The elasticity of the material is great and doesn't break when I put it on. The shape and the holes in the design remain as is when worn. It fits perfectly to me and I feel so sexy when I am wearing it. The fitting is perfect and doesn't change even when wet. The bra part fits perfectly too and provides great comfort. I can highly recommend this swimwear. SO Great!

"These are some REALLY great-smelling candles. The iced mint is one of my favorites! For the price, I would absolutely recommend them. We usually purchase large candles from companies like Yankee Candle Company or others at big retailers like Bed Bath and Beyond, etc. After buying and using these I feel almost embarrassed for purchasing those as they are completely over-priced. These tea lights are a great value. They light easily, burn evenly, and burn to completion. The scent is plenty strong- just as strong or even more compared to candles 4-5 times the cost. The only thing I will admit that I miss is the long-burning ability of the larger candles that can go all day and night. These are much smaller, of course, but still will burn for about 2hrs in my experience thus far. But for the quality at this price they are still worth it. One tea light is enough to give a wonderful scent to my large apartment and I imagine even for a small house. I have a tea light holder that holds several candles and I place of these among other, non-scented, candles and it works great! I would highly recommend this product. I know I won't be wasting any more money on those large, over-priced, candles any more!

"The fabric is thinner than any other T shirt I own. That was my 1st disappointment. It smacks of being cheap. The color isn't close to the color shown.

I normally wear XL, but just to be on the safe side I ordered a XXL. It's quite small. My guess is nearly two sizes small. I have size LG T shirts that fit me better than this XXL.

"I found these at a discount, which I received for an honest review. I'm glad I found the discount, but I didn't really need it. I would have bought these anyway. These headphones are great. I've had a couple of pairs of different bluetooth headphones, but they were no where near as loud as these, which I am very happy with. They're pretty comfortable around my neck, even though they're a solid shape. I prefer more flexible headphones. The best thing about these headphones are the fact that the headphones are retractable. When you wanna use the headphones, you just pull them out and they click until you stop pulling and they lock in place. When you wanna retract them, you just push a button on the inside of the headphones.

Pros: retractable ear buds, very loud, surprisingly comfortable.

Cons: not flexible enough, kinda feels like I could break them.",1
"This phone case is good, it's not the worst but it's not the best by caseguru. I got this for my husband's iphone 6+ and while it fits perfect it's not very heavy duty seems like it will scratch easily but so far not problems with it. It's a nice attractive looking case to me but a bit too much detail for his taste, the design on the top and bottom is unisex and modern in my opinion.

The case comes apart and assembles in two pieces, a hard shell and a rubber sleeve/case. The slit on the back of the hard shell is just that a slit for you to put the ""stand"" it comes with in for propping up. This is where the product fails, the ""stand"" is just a flimsy piece of cardboard reminds me of a cheap business card or a fake credit card you receive in the mail as a pre-approved offer ha! Now, that being said if you don't care that you have to assemble the little card into the slot, and also find a place to keep said card either in the phone case itself or somewhere on your person then this is ok for you.

The case itself however is fine but the stand is a joke. I'm comparing this to my husband's other phone case which has a built in metal stand that pops in and out which for a stand is much more convenient and better quality. I wouldn't recommend buying it for the stand feature alone. Overall, case is great, stand not so much. I purchase this at a discounted price or received for free to give my opinion of it.",1

Some novelty salt and pepper shakers can be awkward to use. Not these! The shape of the pigs is perfectly concurred for my average sized hands. These are loaded from the snout which is a silicone cover. I was nervous about the top/front-loaded design because. No one wants a mountain of salt on their meal because of an ill-fitting nozzle! Despite my best efforts to shake the little snouts free during use, the seal remained steadfast.

One difference from the picture is that my salt shaker was pink and the pepper shaker was blue. The salt shaker dispenses salt from three holes while the pepper shaker dispenses from only one. It's a good idea to check closely for this upon receipt in case this varies between products.

Overall I am excited to add this adorable accent piece to my kitchen decor!

"I am reviewing the Excel Hydrocortisone Spray in a 3 pack. It helped both my puggle and beagle from the endless scratching hot spots which had irritated them for the past month. I would recommend this product to others and received it at a discount for my fair, unbiased review of the product. The  inflammation and redness of the hotspots disappeared in a couple of days. The cortisone worked on stopping the dogs itching. It did not sting when I sprayed directly  onto the spots that were red and they did not flinch.",1
"i don't like spendinf much money on phone accessories or products, especially when its for my older phone. However I dislike having to replace phones more. While I have my iphone 6 and 6+ for personal and business use, I keep my samsung galaxy s4 with me when I travel internationally. Its just more convenient then having to swap out the sim in my iphones. I was really happy to find a screen protector for it especially one thats made with tempered glass. I have tempered glass protectors on basically all my devices. this one was at a great price and I couldn't pass it up. Shamelessly, I have been using a screen protector that I bought at the dollar tree. Guess what though, Its lasted 2 years longer then the name brand ones I got from best buy. Still I figured its time to upgrade my protection a bit since I am traveling with this more. I like keeping my devices in perfect condition so it keeps a good resell value. this will for sure help with that.
install was super easy and comes out flawless and bubble free.

I received a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review of this product. I do factor in the retail cost of the product when considering my star rating.

"I've used a lot of different screen protectors, but had never tried the tempered glass kind before. I just got a new phone and want to keep it pristine, so I decided to give them a try.

First off, these are much easier to apply than the flexible plastic barriers! I was amazed! I assumed they'd be harder to apply because they didn't have as much bend but was completely wrong, and that alone makes them totally worth it. I hate trying to get all those darn bubbles out normally but no bubbles at all with these.

As for protection, I dropped my phone like a dufus  yesterday while going for a walk, and the protector itself cracked, but my phone was still perfectly flawless. The protector did its job and absorbed the impact, I was so relieved! Thank goodness for them being sold in two packs, another went on right away.

I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to help protect their phone.

"The steam cleaner has is extreamly powerful so becareful when you use this. I wouldn't say that this is good for really big jobs but it is perfect for sall jobs around the house like cleaning window sills and sanitizing door knobs, as swell as loosing up old spills. We have been using this for so many small things arounf the house like loosing up the grease along the stove and the grime from hard water on the sinks. This little steamer is packed with power and makes cleaning easier. I would highly recommed, it is a lot better than the bissel steamer I used to have!

"These are a little thin, and it's a little misleading in the advertising.  Each of the can holders has both designs on it, on front and back.  I was under the impression that there were two of one design and one of the other.  But the main problem is that they are thin, and not super useful. They are more a glorified coaster than anything else, so they work all right, but not really for keeping your beer and hand different temperatures.

I was lucky enough to be given the awesome opportunity to purchase this item with a discount on this product in order to provide an honest and unbiased review of the product, in my own words with only how I feel about it, not an inflated review. As such, I do tend to write reviews as honestly as I can, but I also know that because I was able to receive the product at a discount, that that may bias my opinion of the product, so I tend to try to imagine that I had had to pay whatever the full price was for the product at the time I made the purchase, rather than a smaller amount based on the discount, so basically imagine that I did not get a discount, and base my review off of that (sorry if that was confusing). I am hopeful that that helps with the bias and makes my review a more accurate tool for judging the worth of the product, rather than just something that people gloss over and ignore because of the ""I got a discount"" disclaimer at the bottom of the review. As a final addition to this disclaimer, I try to base the length of the review solely off what I feel needs to be said about the product, so some reviews will be quite lengthy and wordy (kind of like this disclaimer), while others will be short, sweet, and to the point (like when the product just straight up works or is just awful - there's only so many ways to say that). TL:DR - I got a discount, but tried to not be biased.",1
"Material a bit too thin, but a very sexy dress and fit very well. !!",0
"These are nice quality, not the best quality you can buy but something from like Kmart or aeropostle. Nothing too expensive but they serve the purpose. They are cute and they go with almost everything. I'm normally an 8.5 I ordered that size and they fit good. Not to wide but not super thin either and I'd say they are true to size. I have pretty big calves and these still have plenty room for my leg. I think that they are comfortable and I wore them for 8 plus hours the first time and they didn't hurt at all. So overall I'm very happy with these boots they are very cute and comfortable. But like I said not the best quality but certainly not the worst I've ever seen so these get five stars because quality = price. I'm glad I got these they are super cute with dresses or with leggings, and like I said they go with everything!  I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest unbiased review, this is my own opinion of the actual use and wear of these boots.",1

"The S7 Edge Tempered Glass Screen Protector is a Great Product. I would recommend it to anyone. The product has full screen protection including the edge, so the screen is protected 100%. The product has a protective film which allows it to be anti-scratch and anti-fingerprint for the S7 Edge while being transparent. The screen is very durable and has excellent work performance with all buttons and ports of the phone being accessible. The Strong hardness anti-scratch and anti-fingerprint effectively improves the current LCD protection. The product has a strong adhesive that makes it easy to install and attach to the phone so that it does not affect the screens touch sensitivity. The glass is ultra thin and very protective. I would purchase this product again.

"Recently, I purchased the ORIGINAL Stainless Steel Salt and Pepper Grinder, a set of 2. They were package perfect so they would not have any breakage from shipping. They are the perfect size, not big enough to take up a lot of space on the table but not small enough that you will not have to keep refilling the container. The lids fit back on tight and are very sturdy. The lid is also adjustable that if you need to change the coarseness of your spices if works wonderfully. These are perfect for my kosher sea salt and my peppercorns. I also made a purchase for my mother and my grandmother and they both love them. They prepare meals for people so I thought they would like them. I am sure that if you are planning on purchasing this product you will not be disappointed. They will make a great house warming gift. I give this salt and pepper grinders a five star.

"This case is amazing..  I wasn't sure that I was going to like it . .
I usually only buy otter boxes for my phone, but number one they were getting way to expensive and number two I wanted a little more of a variety with color choices. So I thought why not try something new.  I was pleasently surprised when I tried this phone case and the dirability of the case first of all is amazing, it protects my phone and it looks great. I love the colors that are offered.  This is a deal that cannot be passed up.. Great price and great selections.

The TryAce Bluetooth Waterproof Speaker with Built in mic & Dedicated Suction Cup (Blue) is great to have in the shower to provide music to sing along with.
I connected it to my ipad and synced it up. It is really to sync. The user manual that comes with it is easy to follow. There is also a USB charging cable. It has a built-in microphone and speaker for your phone if you want to hook it up to your phone for hands free calls.
I love that it is water proof so when I say I put it in the shower, I mean in the shower. The suction cup holds it to the shower wall, and the volume buttons are easy to operate. And while it is water resistant, the manual says not to immerse it completely.
This is a great little speaker for the shower. It has great sound (the static in my video is the camera.)

These come in packs of two.. I ordered four... one for each corner.  I have included pics and a very short video. They come flat.  Read the simple instructions which tell you to attach the spring (DO NOT PRESS DOWN UNTIL UNDER THE MATTRESS) and pay attention to the direction arrow for placement at the head and foot of the bed.  I have a tempurpedic brand mattress and it is HEAVY. Also, memory foam mattress have a dynamic that is different from regular spring coil mattresses, so it took just a little messing about to find just the right position that didn't ""pop"" the springs when simply sitting on the middle edge of the bed.  Additionally, my tempur happens to be and adjustable version.. also a little tricky.  But within I would say 10 minutes I had it done. Helpful to know:  I recommend two people to lift and position the lifters without stress injury from accessing awkward angles, tight access and/or weight of your mattress.  I purchased to see if this would be helpful for my older Mom and so far, I am a fan.  I will use them for a few more weeks and if all goes well, I will order 2 more sets (4 corner lifters) The first pic I have included shows what you get (2 lifters and instructions)... the second shows how tall the lifters are in a full lift (sorry about the clear ruler - about 10-11 inches) and the last is a mini video of how they work.  The lift and press back down with ease, hardly any effort at all.  Which can be good... but then also an issue if you sit on them or close to them. I am hoping that the ""ease"" of use doesn't become a pain because they constantly pop up.  They arrived quickly (I have prime), in good condition via a USPS priority box.  I ALWAYS update my reviews if new info could possibly be useful and just FYI...
  I DO NOT receive free or discounted products
UPDATE: 6/11/2016  Ok... I have to say that these are NOT for use at the head of an adjustable bed.  They just won't stay in place.  So I've removed the ones places at the head and left the ones at the foot of the bed.  I failed to mention that these are basically hard plastic... the springs are metal.  The set at the foot of the bed are working fine.  Wish the bottom of the feet would have some non-stick surface of sort? This would help keep them in place whether you have an adjustable bed or not.
UPDATE 6/18/2016....  So, after using these for a couple of weeks I have decided they are just not for use with an ""adjustable"" style bed.  They move around too much and pop up when adjusting the bed, head and foot.  I am going to move them to a stationary bed I have and see if I like them better.  I was hopeful.  I think if you could get them from moving about so much, somehow anchoring them to the box spring or base of your bed it MIGHT be more useful.. but they are plastic and very slippery at the base.. maybe some gripper material on the bottom? not sure.  The bottom line is they have become too much of an ""issue"" on the adjustable bed.  So if you have a movable base I would say.. .PASS.  Will update once I've put them on the stationary mattress and used them for a bit.",1

"This novel was on of the best books I have ever read. The entire book was very well written, no dull moments. The topic of unwind is very unique, being un-winded means that the government is going to take your body parts and give them to sick people to better benefit them.

"So I purchased this for my boyfriend since he has a gs6 edge. This shipped super quick and was exactly how it was described. The case came almost fully charged. It's pretty cool how the case expands on the top a little so that you can easily out your phone into it. It was really easy to install. The only thing I would say that I didn't like was that there's no coverage for the front of the phone, so if you were to drop your phone you risk the chance of cracking your screen. The case charges your phone pretty quick and there's an indicator on the back of the case to tell you how charged the case is and also to turn on and off the charger. Overall I would say I am super pleased with this charging case although I do wish it would have came with a charging cord.

"Can I start by saying that I love the fact that they include two screen protectors and not just one?
I've had screen protectors before and I ALWAYS seem to mess them up. air bubbles, not aligned properly, dust. Name it, and I've probably messed up that way at least once (let's leave it at once haha!). I loved having the backup just in case I messed up badly.
To begin with, you get the package in this cute little box with lots of individual bags. The directions are really easy and straightforward. Clean your hands, the phone, peel off the film from the sticky side of the screen protector, align it, clear the bubbles and clean it once more for giggles.
The Accessories are nice, but I do wish it had more instructions. For example, there is a dust cleaner that took some thinking to figure out (its sticky and you just sort of stick it over dust to lift it up). There are also dry and wet cleaners (um.. do I use together? Before sticking it? After? Who knows). And the guidance tabs. You really don't need them though!
The sticking is pretty self-explanatory. AND if you happen to mess up, which I did (twice!) it is really easy to unstick the screen. If you align it properly, there are hardly any bubbles. I placed the screen, and just sort of glided my fingers from the bottom to the top of the phone. It was super easy to see where the air was being pushed out, and I did not have one single bubble. On the third try. My first try I could not get rid of bubbles on the sides (which is why I unsticked it in the first place), the second time I had dust under the screen (ugh!).
After I had it on, it works great. I can type just fine, and it is crystal clear. I love it. Almost as importantly, the screen protector is thin enough that I can still put my case on top of it, and it still works great!

I have connected different phones to them, IPhones and Samsungs, and Motorola, you can barely be a foot away or you start losing blue tooth signal and forget about putting it in your pocket, it will not work.

Sound is great but 3 hour battery life is unacceptable. It says 6-8 hours but that must be on the lowest of low settings considering the highest setting is not that loud. If this had actual 8 hours of legit sound I'd give it a 5 but whether at the pool or games this thing dies in 3 hours. Get a Harmon kardon,0
"Ailihen X1 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with microphone and Volume Control for Sports Running, Noise Isolating In-ear earphones for Iphone,Android,Laptop,Tablet (Blue).  I need the ability to add more stars to this one. I love love love these wireless headphones.  The package it come in is nice and convenient to get head phones in and out of.  They are stunning and absolute eye candy for sure.  The blue is very bright and vibrant and the silver looks like brushed metal.  They wirelessly hook up super easy to any device ( I have and ipad pro and a Samsung s6 edge) both hook ups were seamless.  The come with two more sets of replacement ear phone covers.  they comfortably slide into the ear and I have no issues and do not need to keep readjusting them. The volume control is easy to use as you are doing your tasks.  The only  thing I think would be a struggle is if you have a large head and neck then I could see these being a tight fit.  I will be buying more as my kids keep trying to steal them .

"If you are at all involved in animal rescue, and a great quality slip lead is a great thing to have. Dogs in county shelters don't often have collars on, and a slip lead like this far surpasses the nylon ones used there. If you have a slip lead like this in your day pack or vehicle, you can more easily catch a stray dog and help him back to his people. Also great for your personal dogs, especially if you are making a quick jaunt out and don't need a harness.

This slip lead is far softer than I expected, and better made too. This could handle a lot of abuse, and likely a bit of chewing too. I have never seen a buckle on the end of a slip lead like this, but it helps to ensure that the collar portion does not get too tight- a genius concept!

I didn't purchase this product because I needed the clicker, but that is good quality as well. If you've never done clicker training, give it a try. It is a lot of fun for you and your dogs.

The seller states that  portion of sales proceeds goes to animal shelters, which is awesome.

"I recently purchased this Leader Accessories Dog Seat Cover to protect my new leather furniture from my cats. Not long ago we bought beautiful brown leather reclining couches and having four cats our immediate concern was their nails scratching up the leather or their hair (or hairballs yuck) getting into the furniture. We initially had to use old sheets to cover them which is ugly, collects hair like crazy and hides or beautiful furniture completely. So we looked into something better and found one of these quilted covers for our sofa and the chair. They work great so far! The cover is very soft to the touch and looks nice on our furniture. The color compliments the color of the leather we chose and the cats have really taken to them. You'll generally always find a cat or two lounging on these covers. They are machine washable which is important and held up to washing excellently already. My only reason for removing a star is the lack of a strap to hold up the back part so when you sit on these they fall down from the back of the chair or sofa, we are working on ways to fix that. Overall these are fantastic, a must have for pet owners who would like to keep their furniture beautiful and pet damage free. :)

My grand daughter is 9 and she is tall for her age.
I ordered her size 11-12 and it fits her well. She will be 10 soon and can wear them in a fall season.

They look durable but I can predict that my grand daughter will make holes in them in a few days. Kids should be wearing more durable tights or pants.

I usually wear a 38 DD but since I have found that some bras run small I ordered these in a 40 and they fit great. They are made from a soft breathable material that is great for summer. They are supportive and very comfortable.

"I purchased this item as something new for my husband, of course. I'll start by saying the item took forever to arrive. It took about a month or so. I didn't bother checking to get updates on the location because I wasn't in a rush to get it, but if you're looking to purchase this for a specific day I wouldn't bother purchasing this. You may end up disappointed. The item is a nice blue color and is sparkly and sexy. It comes with the dress and a thong. For the fit, the breast cups are small and don't have any support or structure, but the dress overall is a nice fit in my opinion. It's pretty basic for a lingerie but I'm sure the husband will love it. I honestly would not but this item again. I received this product for free or discount.",1
"After dropping my five week old brand new iPhone 6S Plus and shattering the screen, I wanted to investigate better ways to protect the replacement after I got it fixed. As we all know our phones are an integral part of our lives and being without mine for a few days made me realize I needed to take better steps to take care of it. I've always been very careful with my phone and this is the first one I've ever had damaged and had to replace like this, and I hope it will be my last.

This case is very elegant and I like how it shows off the color of the phone (rose gold in my case) through it. I wish it did not cover up the Apple logo. I was also sent the wrong size case, I received one for the regular 6, not the 6 Plus, even though the package it was in said 6 Plus. I was able to easily generate a return label via Amazon and will be able to return for free.

I received this at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I only review items that I genuinely have an interest in, so that way I have a vested reason to leave an honest opinion.

"I have an old loveseat that my English bulldog has decided that he owns. It was a part of my old set of furniture and when I got a new one, I thought I had better not throw it out or he would think he needed to find a new place to sleep.
It was pretty beat up looking,  and did not go at all with the new look I was trying to achieve.
This cover was a perfect solution to the situation. It has a nice look to it and it fits pretty well in the loveseat. I do think I'm going to need to make a few modifications. He is pretty heavy and clumsy, so if I'm not wanting to keep readjusting I will need to add some elastic or something. It doesn't seem to be an issue that is going to be hard to do at all. If he wasn't so big, I wouldn't need to do anything really.
I like the color, it's not going to show his fur at all.
He loves it as well, as, as soon as I had it on he had to check it out. He has been sleeping on it pretty much ever since. We both are happy campers : )

"I previously order boy shorts from Sakkas and loved them but when I ordered them again I ordered a different print and when it arrived I learned that this print is not Sakkas brand but Mamias.  Sakkas brand fit me perfectly but Mamias are large, very stretchy so they bunch up and leave large panty lines.  If you are a size 2-4, they will be too big for you.",0
"My husband loves them. He danced around in them for a while talking about how nice and breathable they are compared to his big thick bulky cotton briefs. They are very comfortable and very soft. They are well made, durable, breathable. We followed the size chart in the picture the waist fits perfectly, but after wearing them for a while he complained that they ride up into your butt crack and he thinks he needed a bigger size. I am not so sure because the waist fits perfectly.

Overall he would really like them if they didn't ride up, so either  A) his butt is too big and these are made for very small butts, or B) your butt cheeks are supposed to hang out or C) we needed a bigger size?

"And another update:
So... check out the replies to this review; Coffee beans - off gassing... screws up the seal.  So back to 3 stars.  The only ""problem"" with the container (assuming it's just off-gassing of freshly roasted beans) is that the little pull nub is too small for my roommate to grab easily.
For most people, it'll probably be fine - but if you have bigger fingers (or diabetic neuropathy and can't feel well with your fingers), you may have trouble grabbing it in order to get the lid off.  So... I haven't bothered to re-check the seal.  I'm still keeping coffee in it, and it still pops up over night, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt at this point and raise the review stars.  If there was a bigger pull nub, it'd be a 4 or 5 - but to be completely honest  - the pull nub is just fine for me.  I wouldn't recommend it for older people with larger hands though.

*updated*
So.... After a couple of days, the vacuum indicator button keeps popping up over night. I haven't pinpointed how long it takes, but it doesn't stay vacuumed. Since that's the whole point, it loses all it's stars.
It still looks nice. I'm sure it's still better at keeping coffee than the Tupperware container I used before, but since the thing can't do what it's supposed to do, 1 star. Which is sad.
It still looks good, and it's certainly no worse sealing than the Tupperware... And that didn't concern me all that much before. It's still an upgrade from where I was - just not to the advertised level.
Amazon will only do a refund, not a replacement. Since I got it for a discount, I'm just going to keep it. I'm not willing to pay full price for something that failed me in the first week - and like I said, it's still an update from the Tupperware.

*original*
I got this for coffee - I started roasting my own beans and needed something larger to store them in.  The vacuum works great!  The little indicator gets sucked down when you've pulled enough air out - but you can keep going.  The plunger gets harder to press after a few pumps.  The little pull tab is functional - and the lid does slide off once you've released the suction.  It's serving its purpose, and is definitely prettier than the ziplock tupperware container I was using.  I'm sure it's also more air tight.
Would I buy it at full price?  Yes.  And as soon as I need another vacuum container, I will.

"This candelabra LED light is stunning, it's very bright and looks great. As you can tell by the pictures, these LED lights are a totally different lighting all together, looks very different and is at least 5x brighter than incandescent bulbs. The light is pure white, daylight- like ( in my opinion is I prefer it to warm white). One thing that I absolutely love about these lights is that they are cool to the touch, very different from incandescent light that instantly get very hot. Another great feature is that they are very cost efficient, they consume I third of the energy in comparison to other types of light bulbs.

I will definitely be replacing all candelabra bulbs on each ceiling fans and light fixtures in my house, this will definitely have an impact on the lighting in the home and an even greater impact on my light bill.
I definitely recommend it to anyone looking to save money on your light bill and make your light fixtures look awesome.

Perfect water bottle here. It is large enough to fit a good amount of liquid in and not have to refill a million times if I'm thirsty.

I purchased this shirt for my husband. The quality of the fabric is great and it fit him very well. He is happy with it. It did not shrink or fade at all after washing.

The three buttons add a nice touch. * I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. In no way does this discount effect my opinion of this product.

"The product comes in a small pouch and I thought to myself that it's a small case so easy to carry.  I took it out and there's a strong unfavorable smell that makes it impossible to use.  The blow valve is tiny so that it's so hard to blow air into that it takes a lot of effort.  It's smaller than the holes to small beach balls so think about how hard it is!  It didn't help that it had two holes already so I am not sure how it will work.  Finally, the pillow is tiny so not very useful if you move around when you sleep.

Overall, I am not happy with this product.  I did get this pillow for free or at a discount in exchange for an honest opinion.  Thank you for reading my review and have a great day.  Aloha",0

"Overall, I am pleased with this Venstar Waterproof Wireless Bluetooth Speaker. In fact I found several very special PROS a d also some Cons, which I list below.

PROS:

1 Loud sound in a small compact size.

2 Up and down volume on top of the unit by holding down the plus or minus.

3 Forward up/down for songs...just press plus or minus button quickly fkr this. I love this function as  any speakers do not have this.

4 Long playing time per charge...I took this out with me and received kver 8 hours in my car and it still played.

5 AUX CABLE imput for playing old radios, CD players.

6 Micro USB Charger port. I use one of my USB Phobe chargers on it. It works fine and plays while charging.

CONS

1 That very loud and annoying voice that tells me device is ready.

2 Pairs OK, but sometimes tricky, but I found a perfect quick pairing way:

....Turn on the CIRCLE/ON/OFF Button first.
....Press the Bluetooth/Phone button.
....You will see BLUETOOTH BUTTON BLINKING QUICKLY.
....Turn on Device Bluetooth and Scan.
....You will see Venstar 208.
....Press Venstar 208
.....You are connected.

This speaker provided for testing/reviewing purposes. In my opinion, I like this speaker and I am happily using it in my Kitchen with my Tablet...And I listen to songs and Tunein Radio and the sound is very good, the music fills my kitchen and dining room.",1
"We purchased this for the table by our bed, mainly for overnight use. So far, we are pleased with the product for the most part.

Pros:
- The charging stand is pretty, which is nice. It's hard to tell sometimes if something is going to be overly bulky or an eye sore, but this is just big enough to do the job, and not be obtrusive to the table space.
- It's made of metal, not plastic, so I suspect it will last as long as we want it to.
- The stand came with a charging cable already attached for the phone (but not for the iWatch)

Cons:
- Some assembly required? We were kind of expecting this to be an out of the box charger, but you actually have to run your own charging cables through the stand, and screw on a bottom plate to cover them.
- Due to the above, this also means that you still need two charging cables going to the wall. I think I assumed it would handle the charging internally and have a single cable to plug in, but this is absolutely *just* a pretty stand and not much else.

Considering the price point of this, we expected it to be more than just a pretty stand for our existing cables to be run through. It's not. If the product was half the price, I'd consider it a decent value. At the current price point though, I honestly don't think it's worth $40+.

Also note:
The iWatch charger isn't meant for non-horizontal charging. The magnet strength is barely enough to hold the watch in place. This isn't necessarily a defect with this product, but it's probably something you need to be aware of ahead of time.

"As a female who is top heavy... ordering scrubs can be difficult. I find that the women scrub tops just never fit right and are uncomfortable. I ordered this grey scrub top in my usual XL when it comes to unisex/men sizes. Be sure to read the seller's SIZE CHART.

When the top came it was in perfect order and as the seller has described. The first thing i noticed with the top is how SOFT it is! It was such a nice change from the stiff and rough feeling of scrub tops that i am used too....even after multiple washes! This is a V-neck style scrub with a pocket on the left chest.  The color is a light grey and what i had expected.

I compared this to a scrub top that i get from the local chain store. In comparison you can see the grey is slightly bigger length and width wise. Again... going back to the seller's size chart make sure to look at it and go based on what they say.

Over all I am very pleased with this scrub top. I will update my review (if needed) after several washes and wears.

I receieved this product for free or at a discounted rate for my honest review. While my views and opinions may differ from yours i do hope that this has helped.",1

"I love these flower pots! They are very colorful and a great size. I did have a bit of difficulty separating them, as they came stacked together and were pretty tight. A light tap of the countertop loosened them up (and did not dent the pots). Although I initially got these to start my herb seeds, I plan to use them for something entirely different now that I've seen them. We host many gatherings at our home that usually include both children and adults. I would like to use them to hold a variety of candy and mints for our guests to brighten up the food table. No worries safety police, I will line them in the event they are not food grade.

- Very pretty colors
- Nice 4"" x 4"" size
- Hooks attach easily and remove just the same
- Easy to store compactly by stacking them and housing handles in the top pot top pot

Overall, great little pots for either growing  things in your garden, using for parties or storing small craft items. **I received this item for free in exchange for an honest review.",1

"When I first received these containers and I held them I could tell these were not very good quality.  They felt very light and not very good quality.  They are a good size, the compartments are pretty deep, and it holds a lot of food.  They stack nicely and are easy to clean.  However, they are very flimsy and bend rather easily.  When i took off the lid the lid itself bent a little bit and I almost thought i had broken it.  I placed some cheese and deli meats in the smaller compartments and some crackers in the bigger one.  When i went to pick up the container I held only the larger compartment and it caused the container to bend back a bit because of the weight of the deli meat and cheese.  As I was hand washing the container it would bend easily as well.  I can't imagine these containers lasting a very long time.  I only used it to store food I didn't use it in the microwave so I don't know how well it works for that.  The price for these containers is way too high for the quality.  They should be priced at $5 or less.  I really wouldn't recommend these containers, there are better quality meal prep containers out there.

"This Large 7 wide Garden Solar Rock Lights Outdoor by Brilliant & Mo is light in weight.  It works in a very similar fashion as the patio solar light so I would not expect it to be super bright with just one of this.

It measures about 7 inches and weights a little over a pound.  It does look and resemble a rock as advertised.

If you are planning to illuminate your exterior stairways and/ or patio pathways, you would need to get a few of these depending on your square footage.  It is a nice way to spice up your exterior decor with this.

In conclusion, I rate the Large 7 wide Garden Solar Rock Lights Outdoor by Brilliant & Mo 4 out of 5 Stars.  I do wish it is brighter since it cost more than pathway LED solar lights.  I also wish it comes in another rock color type that is more in the brown tone that are better for the west coast color rocks.

"Maybe I'm just stupid but I cannot figure out (from the instructions) how to view BOTH the overall time and a ""split"" time ... or should I say ""review"" those times. For example:

I need to time my total time walking AND also the minutes spent in aerobic (brisk) walking. In other words if I start this stopwatch when I first begin  walking (at normal place), I want to be able to activate the Split function when I do begin my aerobic-walking time, discontinue that timer when I stop walking aerobically, and have the intial first start time still couinting up, so that I have my total walk time at the end.

When I stop walking, I want to be able to view (a) my total walk time, let's say it's 42 minutes, AND also my total aerobic walking time within that total (say, 19 minutes.)  But I cannot figure out how to do that with this stopwatch. I can begin the Split count but when I stop the split count, it goes to 0:00 and so all I get at the end is my total walk time.... which is only half of what I need to record.

Can anyone explain exactly how to make this stopwatch do what I need it to do (what buttons to press when or how)? If indeed the watch is capable of recording those two end-times and retaining them until both functions are ""cleared"" back to zero?",0

The problem is that it doesn't pivot or swivel, and most people's wall outlets are low to the ground (knee-height or lower). Unless your power outlet is high up on the wall or you have a mostly empty room that allows for a clear line of sight, your view will be blocked by furniture or other objects.

I don't know whose home Mission Cables test this on, but not mine, or anyone else I know. That really limits the angle I am able to install this.

It's just a rigid plastic holster for the Nest Cam. There are no joints or articulations. Installing it to face my front door means I'll just be looking at chairs and table legs.

"I found this to be an interesting garden item. I live in an apartment but I do have a fenced yard with a single water tap outside. I tried this wonderful item out however I only have 1 hose currently so I only hooked up one side. I left one side closed ( using the lever ) and then was able to turn on and off the water flow to the hose. I Enron took it a step further and attached it to the end of the hose to see if it would work that way and it did! I don't have a need for a set up that way however if you have a large area to water or reach to.. this handy item can sure help out! I love how if you don't need both sides open you can close one or close both off without having to go back to spigot to turn it off. I would have loved having this when I had my house on a corner lot!

"I have twin daughters who are two years old and love bows. I am constantly looking for great quality bows that will last, not fall apart on me, and not cost me a fortune. When these bows came I was very impressed with how they looked. The size was exactly what they described which I was happy to see. I have ordered 5.5"" bows before which were no where near as big as these bows. The assortment of colors are fantastic. There is a bow to go with every outfit we own. (I need to order another set since my twins like to dress the same!) The quality seems to be fantastic to me. They look to be very well made and do not look like they will untie or unravel at all. The bow is attached to a metal slide clip which is what I find stays the best in my daughters hair. Finally, you can't beat the price of these bows. I have paid $5 for just one bow of this size so to get 16 bows for about $14 is a great deal.

"This is a very lightweight and comfortable skirt. I liked the way it fit,felt on my hips, and draped down.

I was worried by the picture that the color of green would be too bright or too dark of a green. It has a very light airy green from what the picture shows.

I like how it goes just below my knees. I am 5 foot 2 inches so if you are a lot taller then it might be right at your knees.

The fabric is light and airy and so is the slip. So, I would recommend a slip underneath because you can see an outline when worn in the sun. The seams are sewn well too. The skirt has an underslip made out of the same fabric as the outer skirt later.

"Premium Bluetooth Stereo Headset with Retractable Wire Management,Sport Neckband Hands-free Headsets Headphones Wireless Stereo Bluetooth Earphones Earbuds (Gold)
I have never h
eard of this brand of headsets and have never really purchased the neckband headsets because they look funny lol so this was going to be a really good review!

The good:
The battery life on these things is really amazing!! Now I see why people like to wear these funny looking headphones!  I took these to work and they lasted my whole 9 hour shift of constant play.  I also took them to the gym after that and they lasted another 3 hours!
The full charge time is also extremely fast!  I took a little over 2 hours to charge from dead!
Youre able to connect up to two devices.
This is really night weight and flexible.  Even while running at the gym it did not fall off or slide towards one side or another.
The sound quality is okay for this caliber.  I was expecting it to be a little worst actually
Great control!!!

The Bad:
IT does take up a lot of space and you cant really carry in your pockets
They still look funny to me lol

What you get:
1 x Tone Infinim
1 x Usb Chargier
1 x User Manual
2 x Earbud

The Results:
Like I said I usually don't like these headsets but this one is really cool!  I LOVE the long battery life.  Sometimes I forget to charge before the gym and with this one I can charge it once a week and you're set for the whole week!  The price is also amazing!!

I received this 8mm Titanium ring and cannot believe how beautiful it is.  I got it for my fiance and when I showed him he was really impressed.  It has 9 cubic zirconia stones set in it also.  It is so dressy and stylish.  It fits him great and he said it is very comfortable.  It is very lightweight also.  Very excited for our wedding day so he can wear it all the time!  I received this product for a discounted price for my fair and honest review.,1
"Mid area/Couch is cut too short...made for boys not men...Levi has the same problemwith the 505 jeans i.e. Plumbers crack
Pants should say ""Made for Men not Boys""...Great Marketing",0
"This glove are awesome.
It gives a very good grip and my hands feel much less hurt than with my previous training glove.
Since I started using a fell my hand are less bruised and more smooth.

I highly recommend this item

"I was skeptical at first, but I put this in at my entry door instead of running a dusk/dawn bulb. It is responsive and bright. My flag blowing in the breeze can even activate it. I have had it for a few months and it seems like a solid bulb. I don't think the dusk/dawn CF bulb was costing me much in power but this will cost even less to run and it should last longer.",0

"My friend had one of these bags at the river when we were tubing and it worked great (none of his snacks were wet), so I'm really excited to try our new 40L waterproof bag next time we go tubing! It will be so much more reliable than the normal backpack we use for all our outings. Compared to a backpack this bag will definitely hold way more items, stay dry and it actually floats on top of the water really well so when it escapes from you it will be easy to find and grab.  I did a test run in my bathtub to see how well it works and if you follow the instructions correctly, this bag really does work! It kept my items nice and dry. I put a ton of items in the bag during my test run and the bag still wasn't close to filled. On the test run I filled the bag with more than 10 shirts, 3 pairs of shoes, 2 jackets, a bag and my eye glass case.  I also like the clips because before closing it you can attach it to your tube or roping so you don't have to worry about holding it. It also comes with a nice long strap you can attach and detach from the bag. I really like that it comes in different bright colors because it will make it easier to spot if this bag does escape from me. Great bag and cannot wait to use it for paddle boarding, tubing, hiking and camping!!! I did receive this item at a discounted price for my honest review.",1
"I inherited my mother's propensity for moving furniture around to new locations every couple of months. As my husband does not share this passion, I needed a way to move furniture more easily on my own without scratching our wood floors. I had just been shoving rags under the feet of the furniture, but this moving kit makes life MUCH easier. I have just been leaving these sliders permanently under the feet of the heaviest living room furniture, as they are small and unobtrusive. They make moving furniture around on hard floors super easy, and I no longer have to worry about scratching the floors. Great product and I highly recommend them.

"My BEDDI alam clock has exceed my expectations!! I am not ""Techy"" but was able to figure out how to work the features on the clock easy! One of the best parts is the find my iPhone. I am constantly losing my phone and my BEDDI clock makes it so much easier to find it. The lights on the clock acts as a reading light for the side of my bed. Another awesome feature is how it lights up my room five minutes before my alarm goes off so I can wake up easier. I cannot say enough wonderful things about this product!!",0
"Nice fun costume piece.  It has multiple straps for a tight fit if you use this for airsoft or other outdoor activities that require a lot of movement.  Viewing is easy and not as obstructed as you would expect for a mask.  The multiple padded points on the inside provide for longer more comfortable use periods.  Great quality for the price

"I bought this 3 in 1 Sandwich, Breakfast and Waffle maker for my son, who lives in a 5th wheel camper while he is away for work.  Living in the camper, he doesn't have much room for storage and/or cooking, so this product is perfect for him.

It is extremely easy to use.  Before he left with it, we made up a bunch of ham and cheese sandwiches with it, and it made me wish I had one of my own.  First of all, you don't need to butter the outside of the bread, so that saves on calories and fats, but the ease of making the sandwiches was just amazing to me.  You simply set a piece of bread on one plate, put your ingredients on it (in our case, it was ham & cheese for a few of them, and peanut butter and jelly for one), then you put the top piece of bread on, close the lid and wait for the light.  Simple as that.

Since owning it, he has told me that he's used the flat plates, and cooked an egg and sausage patty, then made himself a breakfast sandwich.  He said it's a very quick way to make himself a breakfast before leaving for work, and he doesn't have a bunch of dishes to clean when he gets home.  For a single guy, that's a very important feature!

I recommend this 3 in 1 sandwich, breakfast and waffle maker for anyone with limited kitchen space.  Actually...I recommend it for everyone, because I would like to own one myself.  It's very easy to use, it's quick, and the plates wash up super easy.

"I was offended when I saw this. Desecrating an American flag by applying any symbols or design to it is a violation of the US Flag Code and is technically a federal crime (although it's not enforced). If you wouldn't burn an American flag, blow your nose with the flag, fly the flag in the rain, or refuse to stand when the flag passes in a procession, then you should not own or display this flag.",0
"I have been using this speaker in the field for one week and must say that I am quite impressed. The sound quality is good for something that is designed to be simple and rugged. The volume range is pretty good. It does come with an AUX jack, so you can connect your non-bluetooth devices. It comes with a small strap and carabiner, which I used to attach it to my pack. The battery lasted me long enough on ~75% volume to make it through a full day of work.

A note on durability. I unintentionally tested the silicone casing by dropping it, and the speaker was just fine. Though I got lucky that it landed flat. If you drop it on a point or a rock it will probably not fair so well. The IPX4 rating has been proved to me by making it through some light rain. There are flaps covering the USB and AUX ports,  which keep things waterproof.

Overall, very happy I got this speaker.

This router is a great upgrade from the current one I was using. It was on sale so I popped and bought it. I have 100 meg internet and I get that speed throughout my house now. Its great!,0

After a month a stone fell out and the band was scratched to hell.  Then it tarnished - THEN the center stone fell out.  This is a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE ring!,0
"I like this knife. I like how smooth the knife opens and closes; furthermore, I like how sturdy the knife is after I open it. It doesn't feel like it's going to snap closed again. When I purchased the Galindo knife I expected one that opened easily, locked securely, and cut anything in the yard. The knife meet my expectations, and after putting it to the test in the yard, it is very sturdy and performs well when using it to cut vines, rope, and other materials. The only discrepency is there is no notch on the blade to open it with my thumb, but there is an open part on the blade that I can use with my thumb to open the knife. This took a little getting used to, but after practice I don't notice there is no notch on the blade.
I have another Gerber knife. When I am working in the yard or some other similar circumstance the Gerber knife was impractical. I could not open the knife with one hand because the blade would stick to the handle. When I went to close the knife, I had to use two hands because the blade locked into the left side of the handle. I could not push the handle and the blade at the same time to close the knife.
Overall, the Galindo knife had meet my expectations in that it locks securely, opens with one hand, and cuts anything I need to cut in the yard. The Galindo knife is functional and practical.",0

Good quality. Easy to combine to add resistance.,0
"This bike looks great, however when I received the bike there was a hole in the front tube, in the seam about two inches from the stem on the rim-side of the tire. Not a terrible start, but inconvenient none the less. After replacing the tube (not wanting to deal with any other possible manufacturing problems with that tube.), I took the bike for a bit of a ride, rode about 10 miles and then after a small hop off of a curb to avoid foot traffic the derailleur snapped off. I have gotten in a whopping 25 miles in total on this bike, and it is now out of commission. Now to wait for the new, hopefully more quality parts to come in.

Two stars though, I did enjoy the riding I have gotten in.

"Just received this cover and tried it on my Air 2.  Fits perfect!  Quality is great and I can see this will last long.  Only downside is the weight. This case adds quite a lot of weight, almost as if holding two iPad Air 2.",0
I'm moving across the country and wanted to reduce some packing space with these bags. Vacuuming the air out is really easy and the space does reeuce significantly. I'm waiting to see if any if the closed seals leak but they've stayed secure for over a week now.,0
"This shirt arrived on time and was packaged well in a thick zippered plastic bag. I ordered the black and white colored shirt and it looks just as it does in the pictures. The colors are true to the listing. The black is dark and fades into the grey areas.  The edges around the neck and arm holes are solid back.  The bottom hem is sewn well and not too thick.
I am 5'3, wear a C cup and normally wear a medium or large shirt.  I ordered a medium and I am very happy with the fit.  The length is excellent, falling just below the hips.  It has a flattering shape to it that sort of hugs up top but flows at the bottom.  The material is very comfortable and breathable. It is really stretchy, but expandable.  There is a sort of waffled material near the armholes which I am assuming is to catch perspiration.  The shirt does wick sweat away and stays pretty dry. I received this shirt free of charge in exchange of an honest review.",1
"this is a great concept, inflatable hot tub !. cheap price too ! but it doesn't work at all.
#1 the heater cant maintain 104 degrees in 75 degree weather, it usually is 103 when I get in it. within 5 minutes it is at 98 degrees and now its a warn tub not a hot tub. going to cost you another $80 a month to run the thing, $20 for filters every 2 weeks, and about $40 for the chemicals... the main problem is the heater turns off when you turn on the air bubble maker. what a stupid design. People talk about the pump burning out in 1 year, and having to add a heater... I returned it and joined a gym for half the price of maintaining and running a hot tub...... hope this helps",0
The product arrived within 2 days with my Amazon Prime account and looked just as it does on the photo.  It fitted my Samsung Galaxy 7S Edge like a glove.  Now I just need to find my rose color tempered glass screen protector to finish off the look;^),0
